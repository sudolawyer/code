No. 83-271.

Argued March 20, 1984.

Decided June 27, 1984.
Members of college athletic association brought antitrust
challenge to association's plan for televising college
football games of member institutions for the 1981–1985
seasons. The United States District Court for the Western
District of Oklahoma, J., 546 F.Supp. 1276, found that
the plan violated the antitrust laws. The Court of Appeals
for the Tenth Circuit affirmed in part and remanded in
part, 707 F.2d 1147. A stay was granted, 104 S.Ct. 1. On
certiorari, the Supreme Court, Justice Stevens, held that:
(1) although plan constituted horizontal price fixing and
output limitations, it was inappropriate to apply a per se
analysis as restraints on competition were essential if the
product was to be available at all; (2) plan on its face
constituted a restraint on operation of a free market; (3)
relevant market was college football; and (4) restraints
were not justified on basis of procompetitive effect,
protecting live attendance or maintaining competitive
balance among amateur athletic teams.

College athletic association's plan limiting
live broadcasting of college football teams
constituted a “restraint of trade” in the sense
that it limited members' freedom to negotiate
and enter into their own television contracts,
but such restraint would violate Sherman

College athletic association's plan limiting

football games and number of games that
any one college could televise and which
barred association members from making any

Syllabus a1
In 1981, petitioner National Collegiate Athletic
Association (NCAA) adopted a plan for the televising of
college football games of its member institutions for the
1982–1985 seasons. The plan recites that it is intended to
reduce the adverse effect of live television upon football
game attendance. The plan limits the total amount of
televised intercollegiate football games and the number of
games that any one college may televise, and no member
of the NCAA is permitted to make any sale of television
rights except in accordance with the plan. The NCAA has
separate agreements with the two carrying networks, the
American **2952 Broadcasting Cos. and the Columbia
Broadcasting System, granting each network the right to
telecast the live “exposures” described in the plan. Each
network agreed to pay a specified “minimum aggregate
compensation” to the participating NCAA members, and
was authorized to negotiate directly with the members for
the right to televise their games. Respondent Universities,
in addition to being NCAA members, are members
of the College Football Association (CFA), which was
originally organized to promote the interests of major
football-playing colleges within the NCAA structure,
but whose members eventually claimed that they should
have a greater voice in the formulation of football
television policy than they had in the NCAA. The CFA
accordingly negotiated a contract with the National
Broadcasting Co. that would have allowed a more liberal
number of television appearances for each college and
would have increased the revenues realized by CFA
members. In response, the NCAA announced that it
would take disciplinary action against any CFA member

that complied with the CFA–NBC contract. Respondents
then commenced an action in Federal District Court,
which, after an extended trial, held that the controls
exercised by the NCAA over the televising of college
football games violated § 1 of the Sherman Act, and
accordingly granted injunctive relief. The court found
that competition in the relevant market—defined as “live
college football television”—had been restrained in three
ways: (1) the NCAA fixed the price for particular telecasts;
(2) its exclusive network contracts were tantamount to a
group boycott of all other potential broadcasters *86
and its threat of sanctions against its members constituted
a threatened boycott of potential competitors; and (3)
its plan placed an artificial limit on the production of
televised college football. The Court of Appeals agreed
that the Sherman Act had been violated, holding that
the NCAA's television plan constituted illegal per se price
fixing and that even if it were not per se illegal, its
anticompetitive limitation on price and output was not
offset by any procompetitive justifications sufficient to
save the plan even when the totality of the circumstances
was examined.
Held: The NCAA's television plan violates § 1 of the
Sherman Act. Pp. 2958–2970.
(a) While the plan constitutes horizontal price fixing
and output limitation, restraints that ordinarily would
be held “illegal per se,” it would be inappropriate to
apply a per se rule in this case where it involves an
industry in which horizontal restraints on competition
are essential if the product is to be available at all.
The NCAA and its members market competition itself
—contests between competing institutions. Thus, despite
the fact that restraints on the ability of NCAA members
to compete in terms of price and output are involved,
a fair evaluation of their competitive character requires
consideration, under the Rule of Reason, of the NCAA's
justifications for the restraints. But an analysis under the
Rule of Reason does not change the ultimate focus of the
inquiry, which is whether or not the challenged restraints
enhance competition. Pp. 2958–2962.
(b) The NCAA television plan on its face constitutes
a restraint upon the operation of a free market, and
the District Court's findings establish that the plan has
operated to raise price and reduce output, both of which

are unresponsive to consumer preference. Under the Rule
of Reason, these hallmarks of anticompetitive behavior
place upon the NCAA a heavy burden of establishing
an affirmative defense that competitively justifies this
apparent deviation from the operations of a free market.
The NCAA's argument that its television plan can have
no significant anticompetitive effect since it has no market
power must be rejected. As a matter of law, the absence of
proof of market power does not justify a naked restriction
on price or output and, as a factual matter, it is evident
from the record that the NCAA does possess market
power. Pp. 2962–2966.
**2953 (c) The record does not support the NCAA's
proffered justification for its television plan that it
constitutes a cooperative “joint venture” which assists
in the marketing of broadcast rights and hence is
procompetitive. The District Court's contrary findings
undermine such a justification. Pp. 2966–2967.
(d) Nor, contrary to the NCAA's assertion, does the
television plan protect live attendance, since, under the
plan, games are televised during *87 all hours that
college football games are played. Moreover, by seeking
to insulate live ticket sales from the full spectrum of
competition because of its assumption that the product
itself is insufficiently attractive to draw live attendance
when faced with competition from televised games, the
NCAA forwards a justification that is inconsistent with
the Sherman Act's basic policy. “The Rule of Reason
does not support a defense based on the assumption that
competition itself is unreasonable.” National Society of
Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 696,
98 S.Ct. 1355, 1367, 55 L.Ed.2d 637. Pp. 2967–2968.
(e) The interest in maintaining a competitive balance
among amateur athletic teams that the NCAA asserts as
a further justification for its television plan is not related
to any neutral standard or to any readily identifiable
group of competitors. The television plan is not even
arguably tailored to serve such an interest. It does not
regulate the amount of money that any college may
spend on its football program or the way the colleges
may use their football program revenues, but simply
imposes a restriction on one source of revenue that is
more important to some colleges than to others. There
is no evidence that such restriction produces any greater

eligibility, regulations concerning recruitment of athletes,
and rules governing the size of athletic squads and

The University of Oklahoma and the University of

Association has unreasonably restrained trade in the
televising of college football games. After an extended
trial, the District Court found that the NCAA had
violated § 1 of the Sherman Act 1 and granted injunctive
relief. 546 F.Supp. 1276 (WD Okla.1982). The Court of
Appeals agreed that the statute had been violated but

The NCAA has approximately 850 voting members. The
regular members are classified into separate divisions
to reflect differences in size and scope of their
athletic programs. Division I includes 276 colleges with
major athletic programs; in this group only 187 play
intercollegiate football. Divisions II and III include
approximately 500 colleges with less extensive athletic
programs. Division I has been subdivided into Divisions
I–A and I–AA for football.
Some years ago, five major conferences together with
major football-playing independent institutions organized
the College Football Association (CFA). The original
purpose of the CFA was to promote the interests of major
football-playing schools within the NCAA structure. The
Universities of Oklahoma and Georgia, respondents in
this Court, are members of the CFA.

On January 11, 1951, a three-person “Television
Committee,” appointed during the preceding year,
delivered a report to the NCAA's annual convention in
Dallas. Based on preliminary surveys, the committee had
concluded that “television does have an adverse effect
on college football attendance and unless brought under
some control threatens to seriously harm the nation's
overall athletic and physical *90 system.” Id., at 265.
The report emphasized that “the television problem is
truly a national one and requires collective action by the
colleges.” Id., at 270. As a result, the NCAA decided to
retain the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) to
study the impact of television on live attendance, and to
declare a moratorium on the televising of football games.
A television committee was appointed to implement the
decision and to develop an NCAA television plan for
1951. Id., at 277–278.
The committee's 1951 plan provided that only one game a
week could be telecast in each area, with a total blackout
on 3 of the 10 Saturdays during the season. A team
could appear on television only twice during a season.
The plan also provided that the NORC would conduct
a systematic study of the effects of the program on
attendance. Id., at 279. The plan received the virtually
unanimous support of the NCAA membership; only the
University of Pennsylvania challenged it. Pennsylvania
announced that it would televise all its home games. The
council of the NCAA thereafter declared Pennsylvania
a member in bad standing and the four institutions
scheduled to play at Pennsylvania in 1951 refused to do so.
Pennsylvania then reconsidered its decision and abided by
the NCAA plan. Id., at 280–281.
During each of the succeeding five seasons, studies were
made which tended to indicate that television had an
adverse effect on attendance at college football games.
During those years the NCAA continued to exercise
complete control over the number of games that could be
televised. Id., at 325–359.
From 1952 through 1977 the NCAA television committee
followed essentially the same procedure for developing its
television plans. It would first circulate a questionnaire
to the membership and then use the responses as a basis
for formulating **2955 a plan for the ensuing season.
The plan was then submitted to a vote by means of a

mail referendum. Once approved, the plan formed the
basis for NCAA's negotiations *91 with the networks.
Throughout this period the plans retained the essential
purposes of the original plan. See 546 F.Supp., at 1283. 4
Until 1977 the contracts were all for either 1– or 2–
year terms. In 1977 the NCAA adopted “principles of
negotiation” for the future and discontinued the practice
of submitting each plan for membership approval. Then
the NCAA also entered into its first 4–year contract
granting exclusive rights to the American Broadcasting
Cos. (ABC) for the 1978–1981 seasons. ABC had held the
exclusive rights to network telecasts of NCAA football
games since 1965. Id., at 1283–1284.
The Current Plan
The plan adopted in 1981 for the 1982–1985 seasons
is at issue in this case. 5 This plan, like each of its
predecessors, recites that it is intended to reduce, insofar
as possible, the adverse effects of live television upon
football game attendance. 6 It provides that “all forms of
television of the football *92 games of NCAA member
institutions during the Plan control periods shall be in
accordance with this Plan.” App. 35. The plan recites that
the television committee has awarded rights to negotiate
and contract for the telecasting of college football games
of members of the NCAA to two “carrying networks.”
Id., at 36. In addition to the principal award of rights
to the carrying networks, the plan also describes rights
for a “supplementary series” that had been awarded for
the 1982 and 1983 seasons, 7 as well as a procedure for
permitting specific “exception telecasts.” 8
In separate agreements with each of the carrying
networks, ABC and the Columbia Broadcasting System
(CBS), the NCAA granted each the right to telecast the 14
live “exposures” described in the plan, in accordance with
the “ground rules” set **2956 forth therein. 9 Each of the
networks agreed to pay a specified “minimum aggregate
compensation *93 to the participating NCAA member
institutions” during the 4–year period in an amount that
totaled $131,750,000. In essence the agreement authorized
each network to negotiate directly with member schools
for the right to televise their games. The agreement
itself does not describe the method of computing the

compensation for each game, but the practice that has
developed over the years and that the District Court found
would be followed under the current agreement involved
the setting of a recommended fee by a representative of
the NCAA for different types of telecasts, with national
telecasts being the most valuable, regional telecasts being
less valuable, and Division II or Division III games
commanding a still lower price. 10 The aggregate of all
these payments presumably equals the total minimum
aggregate compensation set forth in the basic agreement.
Except for differences in payment between national and
regional telecasts, and with respect to Division II and
Division III games, the amount that any team receives
does not change with the size of the viewing audience, the
number of markets in which the game is telecast, or the
particular characteristic of the game or the participating
teams. Instead, the “ground rules” provide that the
carrying networks make alternate selections of those
games they wish to televise, and thereby obtain the
exclusive right to submit a bid at an essentially fixed price
to the institutions involved. See 546 F.Supp., at 1289–
1293. 11
*94 The plan also contains “appearance requirements”
and “appearance limitations” which pertain to each of
the 2–year periods that the plan is in effect. The basic
requirement imposed on each of the two networks is that
it must schedule appearances for at least 82 different
member institutions during each 2–year period. Under the
appearance limitations no member institution is eligible
to appear on television more than a total of six times and
more than four times nationally, with the appearances to
be divided equally between the two carrying networks.
See id., at 1293. The number of exposures specified in the
contracts also sets an absolute maximum on the number
of games that can be broadcast.
Thus, although the current plan is more elaborate than
any of its predecessors, it retains the essential features
of each of them. It limits the total amount of televised
intercollegiate football and the number of games that any
one team may televise. No member is permitted to make
any **2957 sale of television rights except in accordance
with the basic plan.

Background of this Controversy
Beginning in 1979 CFA members began to advocate
that colleges with major football programs should have
a greater voice in the formulation of football television
policy than they had in the NCAA. CFA therefore
investigated the possibility of negotiating a television
agreement of its own, developed *95 an independent
plan, and obtained a contract offer from the National
Broadcasting Co. (NBC). This contract, which it signed in
August 1981, would have allowed a more liberal number
of appearances for each institution, and would have
increased the overall revenues realized by CFA members.
See id., at 1286.
In response the NCAA publicly announced that it would
take disciplinary action against any CFA member that
complied with the CFA–NBC contract. The NCAA
made it clear that sanctions would not be limited to the
football programs of CFA members, but would apply to
other sports as well. On September 8, 1981, respondents
commenced this action in the United States District
Court for the Western District of Oklahoma and obtained
a preliminary injunction preventing the NCAA from
initiating disciplinary proceedings or otherwise interfering
with CFA's efforts to perform its agreement with NBC.
Notwithstanding the entry of the injunction, most CFA
members were unwilling to commit themselves to the
new contractual arrangement with NBC in the face of
the threatened sanctions and therefore the agreement was
never consummated. See id., at 1286–1287.
Decision of the District Court
After a full trial, the District Court held that the controls
exercised by the NCAA over the televising of college
football games violated the Sherman Act. The District
Court defined the relevant market as “live college football
television” because it found that alternative programming
has a significantly different and lesser audience appeal. Id.,
at 1297–1300. 12 The District Court then concluded that
the NCAA *96 controls over college football are those
of a “classic cartel” with an
“almost absolute control over the supply of college
football which is made available to the networks, to

television advertisers, and ultimately to the viewing
public. Like all other cartels, NCAA members have
sought and achieved a price for their product which is,
in most instances, artificially high. The NCAA cartel
imposes production limits on its members, and maintains
mechanisms for punishing cartel members who seek
to stray from these production quotas. The cartel has
established a uniform price for the products of each of
the member producers, with no regard for the differing
quality of these products or the consumer demand for
these various products.” Id., at 1300–1301.
The District Court found that competition in the relevant
market had been restrained in three ways: (1) NCAA fixed
the price for particular telecasts; (2) its exclusive network
contracts were tantamount to a group boycott of all other
potential broadcasters and its threat of sanctions against
its own members constituted a threatened boycott of
potential competitors; and (3) its plan placed an artificial
limit on the production of televised college football. Id.,
at 1293–1295.
In the District Court the NCAA offered two principal
justifications for its television policies: that they protected
the gate attendance of its members and that they tended
to preserve a competitive balance among the football
programs of the various schools. The District Court
rejected the first justification because the evidence did not
support the claim that college football television adversely
affected gate attendance. Id., at 1295–1296. With respect
to **2958 the “competitive balance” argument, the
District Court found that the evidence failed to show that
the NCAA regulations on matters such as recruitment
and the standards for preserving amateurism were not
sufficient to maintain an appropriate balance. Id., at 1296.

*97 Decision of the Court of Appeals
The Court of Appeals held that the NCAA television
plan constituted illegal per se price fixing, 707 F.2d, at
1152. 13 It rejected each of the three arguments advanced
by NCAA to establish the procompetitive character of its
plan. 14 First, the court rejected the argument that the
television plan promoted live attendance, noting that since
the plan involved a concomitant reduction in viewership
the plan did not result in a net increase in output and
hence was not procompetitive. Id., at 1153–1154. Second,

the Court of Appeals rejected as illegitimate the NCAA's
purpose of promoting athletically balanced competition.
It held that such a consideration amounted to an
argument that “competition will destroy the market”—
a position inconsistent with the policy of the Sherman
Act. Moreover, assuming arguendo that the justification
was legitimate, the court agreed with the District Court's
finding “that any contribution the plan made to athletic
balance could be achieved by less restrictive means.”
Id., at 1154. Third, the Court of Appeals refused to
view the NCAA plan as competitively justified by the
need to compete effectively with other types of television
programming, since it entirely eliminated competition
between producers of football and hence was illegal per se.
Id., at 1155–1156.
[1]
Finally, the Court of Appeals concluded that
even if the television plan were not per se illegal,
its anticompetitive limitation on price and output was
not offset by any *98 procompetitive justification
sufficient to save the plan even when the totality of
the circumstances was examined. Id., at 1157–1160. 15
The case was remanded to the District Court for an
appropriate modification in its injunctive decree. Id., at
1162. 16

II
[2] There can be no doubt that the challenged practices
of the NCAA constitute a “restraint of trade” in the
sense that they limit members' freedom to negotiate and
**2959 enter into their own television contracts. In that
sense, however, every contract is a restraint of trade,
and as we have repeatedly recognized, the Sherman Act
was intended to prohibit only unreasonable restraints of
trade. 17
[3] [4] *99 It is also undeniable that these practices
share characteristics of restraints we have previously
held unreasonable. The NCAA is an association of
schools which compete against each other to attract
television revenues, not to mention fans and athletes.
As the District Court found, the policies of the NCAA
with respect to television rights are ultimately controlled
by the vote of member institutions. By participating
in an association which prevents member institutions

institutions. Thus, despite the fact that this case involves
restraints on the ability of member institutions to compete
in terms of price and output, a fair evaluation of
their competitive character requires consideration of the
NCAA's justifications for the restraints.
[12] Our analysis of this case under the Rule of
Reason, of course, does not change the ultimate focus
of our inquiry. Both per se rules and the Rule of
Reason are employed “to form a judgment about
the competitive significance of the restraint.” National

U.S. 679, 692, 98 S.Ct. 1355, 1365, 55 L.Ed.2d 637 (1978).
A conclusion that a restraint of trade is unreasonable may
be
“based either (1) on the nature or character of the
contracts, or (2) on surrounding circumstances giving rise
to the inference or presumption that they were intended
to restrain trade and enhance prices. Under either branch
of the test, the inquiry is confined to a consideration of
impact on competitive conditions.” Id., at 690, 98 S.Ct.,
at 1364 (footnotes omitted).

output restriction has the effect of raising the price the
networks pay for television rights. 29 Moreover, the *106
court found that by fixing a price for television rights
to all games, the NCAA creates a price structure that is
unresponsive to viewer demand and unrelated to the prices
that would prevail in a competitive market. 30 And, of
course, **2963 since as a practical matter all member
institutions need NCAA approval, members have no real
choice but to adhere to the NCAA's television controls. 31
[15]
[16] The anticompetitive consequences of this
arrangement are apparent. Individual competitors lose
their freedom to compete. *107 32 Price is higher and
output lower than they would otherwise be, and both are
unresponsive to consumer preference. 33 This latter point
is perhaps the most significant, since “Congress designed
the Sherman Act as a ‘consumer welfare prescription.’ ”

effect of reducing the importance of consumer preference

fundamental goal of antitrust law. 34 Restrictions on price

III
Because it restrains price and output, the NCAA's
television plan has a significant potential for
anticompetitive effects. 28 The findings of the District
Court indicate that this *105 potential has been realized.
The District Court found that if member institutions
were free to sell television rights, many more games
would be shown on television, and that the NCAA's

one legal, one factual.

of market power does not justify a naked restriction
on price or output. To the contrary, when there is an

follows that if college football broadcasts be defined as
a separate market—and we are convinced they are—
then the NCAA's complete control over those broadcasts
provides a solid basis for the District Court's conclusion
that the NCAA possesses market power with respect to

interest, without substitutes available in the market, there
is monopoly power.” United States v. E.I. du Pont de

is vivid evidence of the

Moreover, the District

L.Ed.2d 48 (1982) (POWELL, J., dissenting) (footnote
omitted). The essential contribution **2967 made by the
NCAA's arrangement is to define the number of games
that may be televised, to establish the price for each
exposure, and to define the basic terms of each contract
between the network and a home team. The NCAA does
not, however, act as a selling agent for any school or
for any conference of schools. The selection of individual
games, and the negotiation of particular agreements, are
matters left to the networks and the individual schools.

Thus, the effect of the network plan is not to eliminate
individual sales of broadcasts, since these still occur, albeit
subject to fixed prices and output limitations. Unlike

NCAA's television plan produced any procompetitive
concern is that fan interest in a televised game may

adversely affect ticket sales for games that will not appear

on television. 56
that NCAA football could be marketed just as effectively
without the television plan. 52 There is therefore no
predicate in the findings for petitioner's efficiency
justification. Indeed, petitioner's argument is refuted by
the District Court's finding concerning price and output.
If the NCAA's television plan produced procompetitive
efficiencies, the plan would increase output and reduce
the price of televised games. The District Court's contrary
findings accordingly undermine petitioner's position. In
light of these findings, it cannot be said that “the
agreement on price is necessary to market the product at
all.” Broadcast Music, 441 U.S., at 23, 99 S.Ct., at 1564. 53
In Broadcast Music, the availability of a package product
that no individual could offer enhanced the total volume
of music that was sold. Unlike this case, there was no
limit of any kind placed on the volume that might be sold
in the entire market and each individual remained free
to sell his own music without restraint. Here production
has been limited, not enhanced. 54 *115 No individual
school is free to televise its own games without restraint.
The NCAA's efficiency justification is not supported by
the record.
[28] Neither is the NCAA's television plan necessary
to enable the NCAA to penetrate the market through
an attractive package sale. Since broadcasting rights to
college football constitute a unique product for which
there is no ready substitute, there is no need for collective
action in order to enable the product to compete against
its nonexistent competitors. 55 This is borne out by the
District Court's finding that the NCAA's television plan
reduces the volume of television rights sold.

Although the NORC studies in the 1950's provided
some support for the thesis that live attendance would
suffer if *116 unlimited television were permitted, 57
the District Court found that there was no evidence to
support that theory in today's market. 58 Moreover, as the
District Court found, the television plan has evolved in a
manner inconsistent with its original design to protect gate
attendance. Under the current plan, games are shown on
television during all hours that college football games are
played. The plan simply does not protect live attendance
by ensuring that games will not be shown on television at
the same time as live events. 59
There is, however, a more fundamental reason for
rejecting this defense. The NCAA's argument that its
television plan is necessary to protect live attendance is
not based on a desire to maintain the integrity of college
football as a distinct and attractive product, but rather on
a fear that the product will not prove sufficiently attractive
to draw live attendance when faced with competition
from televised games. At bottom the NCAA's position
is that ticket sales for most college games are unable
to compete in a free market. 60 The *117 television
plan protects ticket sales by limiting output—just as any
monopolist increases revenues by reducing output. By
seeking to insulate live ticket sales from the full spectrum
of competition because of its assumption that the product
itself is insufficiently attractive to consumers, petitioner
forwards a justification that is inconsistent with the
basic policy of the Sherman Act. “[T]he Rule of Reason
does not support a defense based on the assumption

VI
[30] Petitioner argues that the interest in maintaining
a competitive balance among amateur athletic teams
is legitimate and important and that it justifies the
regulations challenged in this case. We agree **2969 with
the first part of the argument but not the second.

Our decision not to apply a per se rule to this case rests
in large part on our recognition that a certain degree of
cooperation is necessary if the type of competition that
petitioner and its member institutions seek to market is to
61

be preserved.
It is reasonable to assume that most of
the regulatory controls of the NCAA are justifiable means
of fostering competition among amateur athletic teams
and therefore procompetitive because they enhance public
interest in intercollegiate athletics. The specific restraints
on football telecasts that are challenged in this case do
not, however, fit into the same mold as do rules defining
the conditions of the contest, the eligibility of participants,
or the manner in which members of a joint enterprise
shall share the responsibilities and the benefits of the total
venture.
The NCAA does not claim that its television plan has
equalized or is intended to equalize competition within
any *118 one league. 62 The plan is nationwide in scope
and there is no single league or tournament in which all
college football teams complete. There is no evidence of
any intent to equalize the strength of teams in Division I–
A with those in Division II or Division III, and not even
a colorable basis for giving colleges that have no football
program at all a voice in the management of the revenues
generated by the football programs at other schools. 63
The interest in maintaining a competitive balance that is
asserted by the NCAA as a justification for regulating all
television of intercollegiate football is not related to any
neutral standard or to any readily identifiable group of
competitors.
*119 The television plan is not even arguably tailored to
serve such an interest. It does not regulate the amount of
money that any college may spend on its football program,

nor the way in which the colleges may use the revenues that
are generated by their football programs, whether derived
from the sale of television rights, the sale of tickets, or the
sale of concessions or program advertising. 64 The plan
simply imposes a restriction on one source of revenue that
is more important to some colleges than to others. There
is no evidence that this restriction produces any greater
measure of equality throughout the NCAA than would a
restriction on alumni donations, tuition rates, or any other
revenue-producing activity. At the same time, as **2970
the District Court found, the NCAA imposes a variety
of other restrictions designed to preserve amateurism
which are much better tailored to the goal of competitive
balance than is the television plan, and which are “clearly
sufficient” to preserve competitive balance to the extent it
is within the NCAA's power to do so. 65 And much more
than speculation supported the District Court's findings
on this score. No other NCAA sport employs a similar
plan, and in particular the court found that in the most
closely analogous sport, college basketball, competitive
balance has been maintained without resort to a restrictive
television plan. 66
Perhaps the most important reason for rejecting the
argument that the interest in competitive balance is served
by the television plan is the District Court's unambiguous
and well-supported finding that many more games would
be televised in a free market than under the NCAA
plan. The hypothesis that legitimates the maintenance
of competitive balance as a procompetitive justification
under the Rule of *120 Reason is that equal competition
will maximize consumer demand for the product. 67 The
finding that consumption will materially increase if the
controls are removed is a compelling demonstration that
they do not in fact serve any such legitimate purpose. 68
VII
[31] The NCAA plays a critical role in the maintenance
of a revered tradition of amateurism in college sports.
There can be no question but that it needs ample latitude
to play that role, or that the preservation of the studentathlete in higher education adds richness and diversity
to intercollegiate athletics and is entirely consistent with
the goals of the Sherman Act. But consistent with the

Sherman Act, the role of the NCAA must be to preserve
a tradition that might otherwise die; rules that restrict
output are hardly consistent with this role. Today we
hold only that the record supports the District Court's
conclusion that by curtailing output and blunting the
ability of member institutions to respond to consumer
preference, the NCAA has restricted rather than enhanced
the place of intercollegiate athletics in the Nation's life.
Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.
Justice WHITE, with whom Justice REHNQUIST joins,
dissenting.
The NCAA is an unincorporated, nonprofit, educational
association whose membership includes almost 800
nonprofit public and private colleges and universities
and more than *121 100 nonprofit athletic conferences
and other organizations. Formed in 1905 in response
to a public outcry concerning abuses in intercollegiate
athletics, the NCAA, through its annual convention,
establishes policies and rules governing its members'
participation in college sports, conducts national
championships, exerts control over some of the economic
aspects of revenue-producing sports, and engages in
some more-or-less commercial activities. See Note,
Tackling Intercollegiate Athletics: An Antitrust Analysis,
87 Yale L.J. 655, 656–657 (1978). Although some
of the NCAA's activities, viewed in isolation, bear a
resemblance to those undertaken by professional sports
leagues and associations, the Court errs in treating
intercollegiate athletics under the NCAA's control as
a purely commercial venture in which colleges and
universities participate solely, or **2971 even primarily,
in the pursuit of profits. Accordingly, I dissent.
I
“While it would be fanciful to suggest that colleges are
not concerned about the profitability of their ventures, it
is clear that other, non-commercial goals play a central
role in their sports programs.” J. Weistart & C. Lowell,
The Law of Sports § 5.12 (1979). The NCAA's member
institutions have designed their competitive athletic
programs “to be a vital part of the educational system.”

Constitution and Interpretations of the NCAA, Art. II,
§ 2(a) (1982–1983), reprinted in App. 216. Deviations
from this goal, produced by a persistent and perhaps
inevitable desire to “win at all costs,” have in the past
led, and continue to lead, to a wide range of competitive
excesses that prove harmful to students and institutions
alike. See G. Hanford, Report to the American Council on
Education, An Inquiry into the Need for and Feasibility of
a National Study of Intercollegiate Athletics 74–76 (1974)
(Hanford); Marco, The Place of Intercollegiate Athletics
in Higher Education: The Responsibility of the Faculty,
31 J. Higher Educ. 422, 426 (1968). The fundamental
policy *122 underlying the NCAA's regulatory program,
therefore, is to minimize such deviations and “to
maintain intercollegiate athletics as an integral part of the
educational program and the athlete as an integral part
of the student body and, by so doing, retain a clear line
of demarcation between college athletics and professional
sports.” Constitution and Interpretations of the NCAA,
Art. II, § 2(a), reprinted in App. 216. See 546 F.Supp. 1276,
1309 (WD Okla.1982).
The NCAA, in short, “exist[s] primarily to enhance the
contribution made by amateur athletic competition to
the process of higher education as distinguished from
realizing maximum return on it as an entertainment
commodity.” Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women v. NCAA, 558 F.Supp. 487, 494 (DC 1983),
aff'd, 236 U.S.App.D.C. 311, 735 F.2d 577 (1984). In
pursuing this goal, the organization and its members seek
to provide a public good—a viable system of amateur
athletics—that most likely could not be provided in a
perfectly competitive market. See Hennessey v. NCAA,
564 F.2d 1136, 1153 (CA5 1977). “Without regulation,
the desire of member institutions to remain athletically
competitive would lead them to engage in activities that
deny amateurism to the public. No single institution could
confidently enforce its own standards since it could not
trust its competitors to do the same.” Note, Antitrust and
Nonprofit Entities, 94 Harv.L.Rev. 802, 817–818 (1981).
The history of intercollegiate athletics prior to the advent
of the NCAA provides ample support for this conclusion.
By mitigating what appears to be a clear failure of the free
market to serve the ends and goals of higher education, the
NCAA ensures the continued availability of a unique and
valuable product, the very existence of which might well

be threatened by unbridled competition in the economic
sphere.
In pursuit of its fundamental goal and others related to it,
the NCAA imposes numerous controls on intercollegiate
athletic competition among its members, many of which
“are similar to those which are summarily condemned
when *123 undertaken in a more traditional business
setting.” Weistart & Lowell, supra, at § 5.12.b. Thus,
the NCAA has promulgated and enforced rules limiting
both the compensation of student-athletes, see, e.g.,
Justice v. NCAA, 577 F.Supp. 356 (Ariz.1983), and the
number of coaches a school may hire for its football
and basketball programs, see, e.g., Hennessey v. NCAA,
supra; it also has prohibited athletes who formerly have
been compensated for playing from participating in
intercollegiate competition, see, e.g., Jones v. NCAA,
392 F.Supp. 295 (Mass.1975), restricted the number
of athletic scholarships its members may award, and
established minimum academic standards for recipients of
those scholarships; and it has pervasively regulated the
recruitment process, student eligibility, practice schedules,
squad size, the number of games **2972 played, and
many other aspects of intercollegiate athletics. See 707
F.2d 1147, 1153 (CA10 1983); 546 F.Supp., at 1309. One
clear effect of most, if not all, of these regulations is to
prevent institutions with competitively and economically
successful programs from taking advantage of their
success by expanding their programs, improving the
quality of the product they offer, and increasing
their sports revenues. Yet each of these regulations
represents a desirable and legitimate attempt “to
keep university athletics from becoming professionalized
to the extent that profit making objectives would
overshadow educational objectives.” Kupec v. Atlantic
Coast Conference, 399 F.Supp. 1377, 1380 (MDNC 1975).
Significantly, neither the Court of Appeals nor this Court
questions the validity of these regulations under the Rule
of Reason. See ante, at 2959–2961, 2968; 707 F.2d, at 1153.
Notwithstanding the contrary conclusion of the District
Court, 546 F.Supp., at 1316, and the majority, ante,
at 2968–2969, I do not believe that the restraint under
consideration in this case—the NCAA's television plan
—differs fundamentally for antitrust purposes from
the other seemingly anti-competitive aspects of the
organization's broader program of self- *124 regulation.

The television plan, like many of the NCAA's actions,
furthers several complementary ends. Specifically, the
plan is designed
“to reduce, insofar as possible, the adverse effects of
live television ... upon football game attendance and, in
turn, upon the athletic and related educational programs
dependent upon the proceeds therefrom; to spread
football television participation among as many colleges
as practicable; to reflect properly the image of universities
as educational institutions; to promote college football
through the use of television, to advance the overall
interests of intercollegiate athletics, and to provide college
football television to the public to the extent compatible
with these other objectives.” App. 35.

See also id., at 244, 323, 640, 651, 672. More
generally, in my view, the television plan reflects the
NCAA's fundamental policy of preserving amateurism
and integrating athletics and education. Nor does the
District Court's finding that the plan is intended to
maximize television revenues, 546 F.Supp., at 1288–1289,
1315–1316, warrant any implication that the NCAA and
its member institutions pursue this goal without regard to
the organization's stated policies.
Before addressing the infirmities in the Court's opinion, I
should state my understanding of what the Court holds.
To do so, it is necessary first to restate the essentials of
the NCAA's television plan and to refer to the course
of this case in the lower courts. Under the plan at issue,
4–year contracts were entered into with the American
Broadcasting Co. (ABC), Columbia Broadcasting System
(CBS), and Turner Broadcasting System (Turner) after
competitive bidding. Every fall, ABC and CBS were to
present 14 exposures of college football and Turner would
show 19 evening games. The overall price for each network
was stated in the contracts. The networks select the games
to be telecast and pay directly to the colleges involved
what has developed to be *125 a uniform fee for each
game telecast. Unless within one of the exceptions, only
the designated number of games may be broadcast, and no
NCAA member may arrange for televising its games other
than pursuant to the plan. Under this scheme, of course,
NCAA members must compete against one another
for television appearances, although this competition is
limited somewhat by the fact that no college may appear

on television more than six times in any 2–year period. In
1983, 242 games were televised, 89 network games and 153
under the exceptions provided in the television plan. In
1983, 173 schools appeared on television, 89 on network
games and an additional 84 teams under the exceptions.
Report of the 1983 NCAA Football Television Committee
to **2973 the 78th Annual Convention of the NCAA 61–
65 (1984). 1
The District Court held that the plan constituted price
fixing and output limitation illegal per se under § 1 of the
Sherman Act; it also held that the scheme was an illegal
group boycott, was monopolization forbidden by § 2, and
was in any event an unreasonable restraint of trade. It
then entered an injunction that for all practical purposes
excluded the NCAA from interfering with or regulating
its members' arrangements for televising their football
games. The Court of Appeals, while disagreeing with the
boycott and monopolization holdings, otherwise upheld
the District Court's judgment that the television plan
violated the Sherman Act, focusing almost entirely on the
price-fixing and output-limiting aspects of the television
plan. The Court of Appeals, however, differed with the
District Court with respect to the injunction. After noting
that the injunction vested exclusive control of television
rights in the individual schools, the court stated that,
“[w]hile we hold that the NCAA cannot *126 lawfully
maintain exclusive control of the rights, how far such
rights may be commonly regulated involves speculation
that should not be made on the record of the instant
case.” 707 F.2d, at 1162. The court expressly stated, for
example, that the NCAA could prevent its members from
telecasting games on Friday night in competition with
high school games, ibid., emphasized that the disparity in
revenue between schools could be reduced by “[a] properly
drawn system of pass-over payments to ensure adequate
athletic funding for schools that do not earn substantial
television revenues,” id., at 1159, and indicated that it was
not outlawing “membership-wide contract[s] with opt-out
and pass-over payment provisions, or blackout rules.” Id.,
at 1162. It nevertheless left the District Court's injunction
in full force and remanded the case for further proceedings
in light of its opinion. Anticipating that the Court would
grant certiorari, I stayed the judgment of the Court of
Appeals. 463 U.S. 1311, 104 S.Ct. 1, 77 L.Ed.2d 1294
(1983).

In affirming the Court of Appeals, the Court first holds
that the television plan has sufficient redeeming virtues
to escape condemnation as a per se violation of the
Sherman Act, this because of the inherent characteristics
of competitive athletics and the justifiable role of the
NCAA in regulating college athletics. It nevertheless
affirms the Court of Appeals' judgment that the NCAA
plan is an unreasonable restraint of trade because of what
it deems to be the plan's price-fixing and output-limiting
aspects. As I shall explain, in reaching this result, the
Court traps itself in commercial antitrust rhetoric and
ideology and ignores the context in which the restraints
have been imposed. But it is essential at this point to
emphasize that neither the Court of Appeals nor this
Court purports to hold that the NCAA may not (1) require
its members who televise their games to pool and share
the compensation received among themselves, with other
schools, and with the NCAA; (2) limit the number of
times any member may arrange to have its games shown
on *127 television; or (3) enforce reasonable blackout
rules to avoid head-to-head competition for television
audiences. As I shall demonstrate, the Court wisely and
correctly does not condemn such regulations. What the
Court does affirm is the Court of Appeals' judgment that
the NCAA may not limit the number of games that are
broadcast on television and that it may not contract for
an overall price that has the effect of setting the price
for individual game broadcast rights. 2 I disagree with the
Court in these respects.
**2974 II
“In a competitive market,” the District Court
observed, “each football-playing institution would be an
independent seller of the right to telecast its football
games. Each seller would be free to sell that right to any
entity it chose,” and “for whatever price it could get.”
546 F.Supp., at 1318. Under the NCAA's television plan,
member institutions' competitive freedom is restrained
because, for the most part, television rights are brought
and sold, not on a per-game basis, but as a package
deal. With limited exceptions not particularly relevant
to antitrust scrutiny of the plan, broadcasters wishing
to televise college football must be willing and able to
purchase a package of television rights without knowing in

advance the particular games to which those rights apply.
The real negotiations over price and terms take place
between the broadcasters and the NCAA rather *128
than between the broadcasters and individual schools.
Knowing that some games will be worth more to them
than others, the networks undoubtedly exercise whatever
bargaining power they possess to ensure that the minimum
aggregate compensation they agree to provide for the
package bears some relation to the average value to them
of the games they anticipate televising. Because some
schools' games contribute disproportionately to the total
value of the package, see id., at 1293, the manner in
which the minimum aggregate compensation is distributed
among schools whose games are televised has given rise
to a situation under which less prominent schools receive
more in rights fees than they would receive in a competitive
market and football powers like respondents receive less.
Id., at 1315.
As I have said, the Court does not hold, nor did the
Court of Appeals hold, that this redistributive effect
alone would be sufficient to subject the television plan
to condemnation under § 1 of the Sherman Act. Nor
should it, for an agreement to share football revenues
to a certain extent is an essential aspect of maintaining
some balance of strength among competing colleges
and of minimizing the tendency to professionalism in
the dominant schools. Sharing with the NCAA itself
is also a price legitimately exacted in exchange for
the numerous benefits of membership in the NCAA,
including its many-faceted efforts to maintain a system
of competitive, amateur athletics. For the same reasons,
limiting the number of television appearances by any
college is an essential attribute of a balanced amateur
athletic system. Even with shared television revenues,
unlimited appearances by a few schools would inevitably
give them an insuperable advantage over all others and in
the end defeat any efforts to maintain a system of athletic
competition among amateurs who measure up to college
scholastic requirements.
The Court relies instead primarily on the District Court's
findings that (1) the television plan restricts output; and
(2) the plan creates a noncompetitive price structure that
is unresponsive to viewer demand. Ante, at 2962. See,
*129 e.g., 546 F.Supp., at 1318–1319. These findings

notwithstanding, I am unconvinced that the television
plan has a substantial anticompetitive effect.
First, it is not clear to me that the District Court employed
the proper measure of output. I am not prepared to say
that the District Court's finding that “many more college
football games would be televised” in the absence of
the NCAA controls, id., at 1294, is clearly erroneous.
To the extent that output is measured solely in terms
of the number of televised games, I need not **2975
deny that it is reduced by the NCAA's television plan.
But this measure of output is not the proper one. The
District Court found that eliminating the plan would
reduce the number of games on network television
and increase the number of games shown locally and
regionally. Id., at 1307. It made no finding concerning
the effect of the plan on total viewership, which is the
more appropriate measure of output or, at least, of the
claimed anticompetitive effects of the NCAA plan. This
is the NCAA's position, and it seems likely to me that
the television plan, by increasing network coverage at the
expense of local broadcasts, actually expands the total
television audience for NCAA football. The NCAA would
surely be an irrational “profit maximizer” if this were
not the case. In the absence of a contrary finding by the
District Court, I cannot conclude that respondents carried
their burden of showing that the television plan has an
adverse effect on output and is therefore anticompetitive.
Second, and even more important, I am unconvinced that
respondents have proved that any reduction in the number
of televised college football games brought about by the
NCAA's television plan has resulted in an anticompetitive
increase in the price of television rights. The District
Court found, of course, that “the networks are actually
paying the large fees because the NCAA agrees to limit
production. If the NCAA would not agree to limit
production, the networks would not pay so large a fee.”
Id., at 1294. Undoubtedly, this is true. But the market for
television rights to college football competitions should
not be equated to the markets *130 for wheat or widgets.
Reductions in output by monopolists in most product
markets enable producers to exact a higher price for the
same product. By restricting the number of games that can
be televised, however, the NCAA creates a new product
—exclusive television rights—that are more valuable to

networks than the products that its individual members
could market independently.
The television plan makes a certain number of games
available for purchase by television networks and limits
the incidence of head-to-head competition between
football telecasts for the available viewers. Because
competition is limited, the purchasing network can count
on a larger share of the audience, which translates into
greater advertising revenues and, accordingly, into larger
payments per game to the televised teams. There is thus a
relationship between the size of the rights payments and
the value of the product being purchased by the networks;
a network purchasing a series of games under the plan is
willing to pay more than would one purchasing the same
games in the absence of the plan since the plan enables the
network to deliver a larger share of the available audience
to advertisers and thus to increase its own revenues. In
short, by focusing only on the price paid by the networks
for television rights rather than on the nature and quality
of the product delivered by the NCAA and its member
institutions, the District Court, and this Court as well, may
well have deemed anticompetitive a rise in price that more
properly should be attributed to an increase in output,
measured in terms of viewership.
Third, the District Court's emphasis on the prices paid
for particular games seems misdirected and erroneous as a
matter of law. The distribution of the minimum aggregate
fees among participants in the television plan is, of course,
not wholly based on a competitive price structure that is
responsive to viewer demand and is only partially related
to the value those schools contribute to the total package
the networks agree to buy. But as I have already indicated,
see *131 supra, at 2974, this “redistribution” of total
television revenues is a wholly justifiable, even necessary,
aspect of maintaining a system of truly competitive college
teams. As long as the NCAA cannot artificially fix the
price of the entire package and demand supercompetitive
prices, this aspect of the plan should be of little concern.
And I find little, if anything, in the record to support
**2976 the notion that the NCAA has power to extract
from the television networks more than the broadcasting
rights are worth in the marketplace.
III

Even if I were convinced that the District Court did not
err in failing to look to total viewership, as opposed to
the number of televised games, when measuring output
and anticompetitive effect and in failing fully to consider
whether the NCAA possesses power to fix the package
price, as opposed to the distribution of that package
price among participating teams, I would nevertheless
hold that the television plan passes muster under the
Rule of Reason. The NCAA argues strenuously that
the plan and the network contracts “are part of a joint
venture among many of the nation's universities to create
a product—high-quality college football—and offer that
product in a way attractive to both fans in the stadiums
and viewers on [television]. The cooperation in producing
the product makes it more competitive against other
[[[[television] (and live) attractions.” Brief for Petitioner
15. The Court recognizes that, “[i]f the NCAA faced
‘interbrand’ competition from available substitutes, then
certain forms of collective action might be appropriate in
order to enhance its ability to compete.” Ante, at 2967, n.
55. See Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433
U.S. 36, 54–57, 97 S.Ct. 2549, 2559–2561, 53 L.Ed.2d 568
(1977). It rejects the NCAA's proffered procompetitive
justification, however, on the ground that college football
is a unique product for which there are no available
substitutes and “there is no need for collective action in
*132 order to enable the product to compete against
its nonexistent competitors.” Ante, at 2967 (footnote
omitted). This proposition is singularly unpersuasive.
It is one thing to say that “NCAA football is a unique
product,” 546 F.Supp., at 1299, that “intercollegiate
football telecasts generate an audience uniquely attractive
to advertisers and that competitors are unable to offer
programming that can attract a similar audience.” Ante,
at 2965 (footnote omitted). See 707 F.2d, at 1158–1159;
546 F.Supp., at 1298–1300. It is quite another, in my view,
to say that maintenance or enhancement of the quality of
NCAA football telecasts is unnecessary to enable those
telecasts to compete effectively against other forms of
entertainment. The NCAA has no monopoly power when
competing against other types of entertainment. Should
the quality of the NCAA's product “deteriorate to any
perceptible degree or should the cost of ‘using’ its product
rise, some fans undoubtedly would turn to another form
of entertainment.... Because of the broad possibilities for

belongs in the broader ‘entertainment’ market rather than

Hanford, at 67; J. Michener, Sports in America 208–209
(1976); Note, 87 Yale L.J., at 661, and n. 31.
The NCAA has suggested a number of plausible ways
in which its television plan might enhance the ability of
college football telecasts to compete against other forms
of entertainment. Brief for Petitioner 22–25. Although
the District Court did conclude that the plan is “not
necessary for effective marketing of the product,” 546
F.Supp., at 1307, its *133 finding was directed only at the
question whether college football telecasts would continue
in the absence of the plan. It made no explicit findings
concerning the effect of the plan on viewership and thus
did not reject the factual premise of the NCAA's argument
that the plan might enhance competition by increasing
**2977 the market penetration of NCAA football. See
also 707 F.2d, at 1154–1156, 1160. The District Court's
finding that network coverage of NCAA football would
likely decrease if the plan were struck down, 546 F.Supp.,
at 1307, in fact, strongly suggests the validity of the
NCAA's position. On the record now before the Court,
therefore, I am not prepared to conclude that the restraints
imposed by the NCAA's television plan are “such as may
suppress or even destroy competition” rather than “such
as merely regulat[e] and perhaps thereby promot [[[[e]
competition.” Chicago Board of Trade v. United States,
246 U.S. 231, 238, 38 S.Ct. 242, 244, 62 L.Ed. 683 (1918).
IV
Finally, I return to the point with which I began—the
essentially noneconomic nature of the NCAA's program
of self-regulation. Like Judge Barrett, who dissented in
the Court of Appeals, I believe that the lower courts
“erred by subjugating the NCAA's educational goals
(and, incidentally, those which Oklahoma and Georgia

insist must be maintained in any event) to the purely
competitive commercialism of [an] ‘every school for itself’
approach to television contract bargaining.” 707 F.2d,
at 1168. Although the NCAA does not enjoy blanket
immunity from the antitrust laws, cf. Goldfarb v. Virginia
State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 95 S.Ct. 2004, 44 L.Ed.2d 572
(1975), it is important to remember that the Sherman Act
“is aimed primarily at combinations having commercial
objectives and is applied only to a very limited extent to
organizations ... which normally have other objectives.”
Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway–Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 207,
213, n. 7, 79 S.Ct. 705, 710, n. 7, 3 L.Ed.2d 741 (1959).
The fact that a restraint operates on nonprofit educational
institutions as distinguished from business entities is as
“relevant *134 in determining whether that particular
restraint violates the Sherman Act” as is the fact that
a restraint affects a profession rather than a business.
Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, supra, at 788, n. 17, 95
S.Ct., at 2013, n. 17. Cf. Community Communications Co.
v. Boulder, 455 U.S. 40, 56, n. 20, 102 S.Ct. 835, 843, n.
20, 70 L.Ed.2d 810 (1982). The legitimate noneconomic
goals of colleges and universities should not be ignored
in analyzing restraints imposed by associations of such
institutions on their members, and these noneconomic
goals “may require that a particular practice, which could
properly be viewed as a violation of the Sherman Act
in another context, be treated differently.” Goldfarb v.
Virginia State Bar, supra, at 788, n. 17, 95 S.Ct., at 2013,
n. 17. The Court of Appeals, like the District Court,
flatly refused to consider what it termed “noneconomic”
justifications advanced by the NCAA in support of the
television plan. It was of the view that our decision
in National Society of Professional Engineers v. United
States, 435 U.S. 679, 98 S.Ct. 1355, 55 L.Ed.2d 637 (1978),
precludes reliance on noneconomic factors in assessing the
reasonableness of the television plan. 707 F.2d, at 1154;
see Tr. of Oral Arg. 24–25. This view was mistaken, and
I note that the Court does not in so many words repeat
this error.
Professional Engineers did make clear that antitrust
analysis usually turns on “competitive conditions” and
“economic conceptions.” 435 U.S., at 690, and n. 16,
98 S.Ct., at 1364, and n. 16. Ordinarily, “the inquiry
mandated by the Rule of Reason is whether the challenged
agreement is one that promotes competition or one that

suppresses competition.” Id., at 691, 98 S.Ct., at 1365.
The purpose of antitrust analysis, the Court emphasized,
“is to form a judgment about the competitive significance
of the restraint; it is not to decide whether a policy
favoring competition is in the public interest, or in
the interest of the members of an industry.” Id., at
692, 98 S.Ct., at 1365. Broadly read, these statements
suggest that noneconomic values like the promotion
of amateurism and fundamental educational objectives
could not save the television plan from condemnation
under the Sherman Act. *135 But these **2978
statements were made in response to “public interest”
justifications proffered in defense of a ban on competitive
bidding imposed by practitioners engaged in standard,
profit-motivated commercial activities. The primarily
noneconomic values pursued by educational institutions
differ fundamentally from the “overriding commercial
purpose of [the] day-to-day activities” of engineers,
lawyers, doctors, and businessmen, Gulland, Byrne,
& Steinbach, Intercollegiate Athletics and Television
Contracts: Beyond Economic Justifications in Antitrust
Analysis of Agreements Among Colleges, 52 Ford.L.Rev.
717, 728 (1984), and neither Professional Engineers
nor any other decision of this Court suggests that
associations of nonprofit educational institutions must
defend their self-regulatory restraints solely in terms of
their competitive impact, without regard for the legitimate
noneconomic values they promote.
When these values are factored into the balance, the
NCAA's television plan seems eminently reasonable. Most
fundamentally, the plan fosters the goal of amateurism
by spreading revenues among various schools and
reducing the financial incentives toward professionalism.
As the Court observes, the NCAA imposes a variety
of restrictions perhaps better suited than the television
plan for the preservation of amateurism. Ante, at 2970.
Although the NCAA does attempt vigorously to enforce

these restrictions, the vast potential for abuse suggests
that measures, like the television plan, designed to
limit the rewards of professionalism are fully consistent
with, and essential to the attainment of, the NCAA's
objectives. In short, “[t]he restraints upon Oklahoma and
Georgia and other colleges and universities with excellent
football programs insure that they confine those programs
within the principles of amateurism so that intercollegiate
athletics supplement, rather than inhibit, educational
achievement.” 707 F.2d, at 1167 (Barrett, J., dissenting).
The collateral consequences of the spreading of *136
regional and national appearances among a number
of schools are many: the television plan, like the ban
on compensating student-athletes, may well encourage
students to choose their schools, at least in part, on the
basis of educational quality by reducing the perceived
economic element of the choice, see Note, 87 Yale L.J.,
at 676, n. 106; it helps ensure the economic viability of
athletic programs at a wide variety of schools with weaker
football teams; and it “promot[es] competitive football
among many and varied amateur teams nationwide.”
Gulland, Byrne, & Steinbach, supra, at 722 (footnote
omitted). These important contributions, I believe, are
sufficient to offset any minimal anticompetitive effects of
the television plan.
For all of these reasons, I would reverse the judgment
of the Court of Appeals. At the very least, the Court of
Appeals should be directed to vacate the injunction of
the District Court pending the further proceedings that
will be necessary to amend the outstanding injunction to
accommodate the substantial remaining authority of the
NCAA to regulate the telecasting of its members' football
games.

According to the NCAA football television committee's 1981 briefing book: “As far as is known, there were [then] six
3
television sets in Philadelphia: and all were tuned to the game.” App. 244.
The television committee's 1981 briefing book elaborates:
4
“In 1952, the NCAA Television Committee initiated a plan for controlling the televising of college football games. The
plans have remained remarkably similar as to their essential features over the past 30 years. They have had the following
primary objectives and purposes:
“1. To reduce, insofar as possible, the adverse effects of live television upon football game attendance and, in turn, upon
the athletic and education programs dependent upon that football attendance;
“2. To spread television among as many NCAA member colleges as possible; and
“3. To provide football television to the public to the extent compatible with the other two objectives.” Ibid.
Because respondents sought and obtained only injunctive relief against future violations of § 1 in the District Court, we
5
do not consider previous NCAA television plans except to the extent that they shed light on the purpose and effect of
the current plan.
“The purposes of this Plan shall be to reduce, insofar as possible, the adverse effects of live television upon football game
6
attendance and, in turn, upon the athletic and related educational programs dependent upon the proceeds therefrom; to
spread football television participation among as many colleges as practicable; to reflect properly the image of universities
as educational institutions; to promote college football through the use of television, to advance the overall interests of
intercollegiate athletics, and to provide college football television to the public to the extent compatible with these other
objectives.” Id., at 35 (parenthetical omitted).
The supplementary series is described in a separate article of the plan. It is to consist of no more than 36 exposures in
7
each of the first two years and no more than 40 exposures in the third and fourth years of the plan. Those exposures
are to be scheduled on Saturday evenings or at other times that do not conflict with the principal football series that is
scheduled for Saturday afternoons. Id., at 86–92.
An “exception” telecast is permitted in the home team's market of games that are sold out, and in the visiting team's
8
market of games played more than 400 miles from the visiting team's campus, but in both cases only if the broadcast
would not be shown in an area where another college football game is to be played. Id., at 62–72. Also, Division II and
Division III institutions are allowed complete freedom to televise their games, except that the games may not appear on
a network of more than five stations without the permission of the NCAA. Id., at 73–74.
In addition to its contracts with the carrying networks, the NCAA has contracted with Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.
9
(TBS), for the exclusive right to cablecast NCAA football games. The minimum aggregate fee for the initial 2–year period
of the TBS contract is $17,696,000. 546 F.Supp., at 1291–1292.
10 The football television committee's briefing book for 1981 recites that a fee of $600,000 was paid for each of the 12
national games telecast by ABC during the regular fall season and $426,779 was paid for each of the 46 regional telecasts
in 1980. App. 250. The report further recites that “Division I members received $27,842,185 from 1980 football television
revenue, 89.8 percent of the total. Division II's share was $625,195 (2.0 percent), while Division III received $385,195
(1.3 percent) and the NCAA $2,147,425 (6.9 percent).” Id., at 251.
11 The District Court explained how the agreement eliminates competition for broadcasting rights:
“First, the networks have no intention to engage in bidding. Second, once the network holding first choice for any given
date has made its choice and agreed to a rights fee for that game with the two teams involved, the other network is then
in a monopsony position. The schools cannot threaten to sell the broadcast rights to any other network. They cannot
sell to NBC without committing a violation of NCAA rules. They cannot sell to the network which had first choice over
that particular date because, again, they would be in violation of NCAA rules, and the network would be in violation of its
agreement with NCAA. Thus, NCAA creates a single eligible buyer for the product of all but the two schools selected by the
network having first choice. Free market competition is thus destroyed under the new plan.” 546 F.Supp., at 1292–1293.
12 The District Court held that the NCAA had monopolized the relevant market in violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act, 15
U.S.C. § 2. See 546 F.Supp., at 1319–1323. The Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to reach this issue, as do we.
13 The Court of Appeals rejected the District Court's boycott holding, since all broadcasters were free to negotiate for
a contract as carrying networks and the threat of sanctions against members for violating NCAA rules could not be
considered a boycott if the rules were otherwise valid. 707 F.2d, at 1160–1161.

14 In the Court of Appeals as well as the District Court, petitioner argued that respondents had suffered no injury of the type
the antitrust laws were designed to prevent, relying on Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl–O–Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 97
S.Ct. 690, 50 L.Ed.2d 70 (1977). Both courts rejected its position, 707 F.2d, at 1150–1152; 546 F.Supp., at 1303–1304.
Petitioner does not seek review on that question in this Court. Brief for Petitioner 5, n. 1.
15 The Court of Appeals rejected petitioner's position that it should set aside many of the District Court's findings as clearly
erroneous. In accord with our usual practice, we must now accord great weight to a finding of fact which has been made
by a district court and approved by a court of appeals. See, e.g., Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613, 623, 102 S.Ct. 3272,
3278, 73 L.Ed.2d 1012 (1982). In any event, petitioner does not now ask us to set aside any of the findings of the District
Court, but rather argues only that both the District Court and the Court of Appeals erred as a matter of law. Brief for
Petitioner 6, n. 2, 18–19.
16 Judge Barrett dissented on the ground that the NCAA television plan's primary purpose was not anticompetitive. “Rather,
it is designed to further the purposes and objectives of the NCAA, which are to maintain intercollegiate football as an
amateur sport and an adjunct of the academic endeavors of the institutions. One of the key purposes is to insure that
the student athlete is fully integrated into academic endeavors.” 707 F.2d, at 1163. He regarded the television restraints
as fully justified “in that they are necessary to maintain intercollegiate football as amateur competition.” Id., at 1165. He
added: “The restraints upon Oklahoma and Georgia and other colleges and universities with excellent football programs
insure that they confine those programs within the principles of amateurism so that intercollegiate athletics supplement,
rather than inhibit, academic achievement.” Id., at 1167.

the likelihood that horizontal price and output restrictions are anticompetitive is generally sufficient to justify application
of the per se rule without inquiry into the special characteristics of a particular industry. See Arizona v. Maricopa County
Medical Society, 457 U.S., at 349–351, 102 S.Ct., at 2475–2476; National Society of Professional Engineers v. United
States, 435 U.S., at 689–690, 98 S.Ct., at 1364.
22 There is no doubt that the sweeping language of § 1 applies to nonprofit entities, Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S.
773, 786–787, 95 S.Ct. 2004, 2012–2013, 44 L.Ed.2d 572 (1975), and in the past we have imposed antitrust liability
on nonprofit entities which have engaged in anticompetitive conduct, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Inc. v.
Hydrolevel Corp., 456 U.S. 556, 576, 102 S.Ct. 1935, 1947, 72 L.Ed.2d 330 (1982). Moreover, the economic significance
of the NCAA's nonprofit character is questionable at best. Since the District Court found that the NCAA and its member
institutions are in fact organized to maximize revenues, see 546 F.Supp., at 1288–1289, it is unclear why petitioner is
less likely to restrict output in order to raise revenues above those that could be realized in a competitive market than
would be a for-profit entity. Petitioner does not rely on its nonprofit character as a basis for reversal. Tr. of Oral Arg. 24.

26 Indeed, there is often no bright line separating per se from Rule of Reason analysis. Per se rules may require considerable
inquiry into market conditions before the evidence justifies a presumption of anticompetitive conduct. For example,
while the Court has spoken of a “per se” rule against tying arrangements, it has also recognized that tying may have
procompetitive justifications that make it inappropriate to condemn without considerable market analysis. See Jefferson
Parish Hospital Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S., at 11–12, 104 S.Ct., at 1558.
27 “The Sherman Act was designed to be a comprehensive charter of economic liberty aimed at preserving free and
unfettered competition as the rule of trade. It rests on the premise that the unrestrained interaction of competitive forces
will yield the best allocation of our economic resources, the lowest prices, the highest quality and the greatest material
progress, while at the same time providing an environment conducive to the preservation of our democratic political
and social institutions. But even were that premise open to question, the policy unequivocally laid down by the Act is
competition. And to this end it prohibits ‘Every contract, combination ... or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce
among the Several States.’ ” Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 4–5, 78 S.Ct. 514, 517–518, 2 L.Ed.2d
545 (1958).
28 In this connection, it is not without significance that Congress felt the need to grant professional sports an exemption
from the antitrust laws for joint marketing of television rights. See 15 U.S.C. §§ 1291–1295. The legislative history of
this exemption demonstrates Congress' recognition that agreements among league members to sell television rights in a
cooperative fashion could run afoul of the Sherman Act, and in particular reflects its awareness of the decision in United
States v. National Football League, 116 F.Supp. 319 (ED Pa.1953), which held that an agreement among the teams of the
National Football League that each team would not permit stations to telecast its games within 75 miles of the home city
of another team on a day when that team was not playing at home and was televising its game by use of a station within
75 miles of its home city, violated § 1 of the Sherman Act. See S.Rep. No. 1087, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. (1961); H.R.Rep.

(statement of Pete Rozelle); id., at 69–70 (letter from Assistant Attorney General Loevinger).
29 “It is clear from the evidence that were it not for the NCAA controls, many more college football games would be
televised. This is particularly true at the local level. Because of NCAA controls, local stations are often unable to televise
games which they would like to, even when the games are not being televised at the network level. The circumstances
which would allow so-called exception telecasts arise infrequently for many schools, and the evidence is clear that local
broadcasts of college football would occur far more frequently were it not for the NCAA controls. This is not a surprising
result. Indeed, this horizontal agreement to limit the availability of games to potential broadcasters is the very essence
of NCAA's agreements with the networks. The evidence establishes the fact that the networks are actually paying the
large fees because the NCAA agrees to limit production. If the NCAA would not agree to limit production, the networks
would not pay so large a fee. Because NCAA limits production, the networks need not fear that their broadcasts will have
to compete head-to-head with other college football telecasts, either on other the networks or on various local stations.
Therefore, the Court concludes that the membership of NCAA has agreed to limit production to a level far below that
which would occur in a free market situation.” 546 F.Supp., at 1294.
30 “Turning to the price paid for the product, it is clear that the NCAA controls utterly destroy free market competition. NCAA
has commandeered the rights of its members and sold those rights for a sum certain. In so doing, it has fixed the minimum,
maximum and actual price which will be paid to the schools appearing on ABC, CBS and TBS. NCAA has created the
mechanism which produces a uniform price for each national telecast, and a uniform price for each regional telecast.
Because of the NCAA controls, the price which is paid for the right to televise any particular game is responsive neither
to the relative quality of the teams playing the game nor to viewer preference.
“In a competitive market, each college fielding a football team would be free to sell the right to televise its games for
whatever price it could get. The prices would vary for the games, with games between prominent schools drawing a larger
price than games between less prominent schools. Games between the more prominent schools would draw a larger
audience than other games. Advertisers would pay higher rates for commercial time because of the larger audience. The
telecaster would then be willing to pay larger rights fees due to the increased prices paid by the advertisers. Thus, the price
which the telecaster would pay for a particular game would be dependent on the expected size of the viewing audience.
Clearly, the NCAA controls grossly distort the prices actually paid for an individual game from that to be expected in a
free market.” Id., at 1318.
31 Since, as the District Court found, NCAA approval is necessary for any institution that wishes to compete in intercollegiate
sports, the NCAA has a potent tool at its disposal for restraining institutions which require its approval. See Silver v. New
York Stock Exchange, 373 U.S. 341, 347–349, and n. 5, 83 S.Ct. 1246, 1251–1252, and n. 5, 10 L.Ed.2d 389 (1963);
Associated Press v. United States, 326 U.S., at 17–18, 65 S.Ct., at 1423.
32 See Fashion Originators' Guild of America, Inc. v. FTC, 312 U.S. 457, 465, 61 S.Ct. 703, 706, 85 L.Ed. 949 (1941);
Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Co. v. United States, 226 U.S., at 47–49, 33 S.Ct., at 14–15; Montague & Co. v. Lowry,
193 U.S. 38, 24 S.Ct. 307, 48 L.Ed. 608 (1904).
33 “In this case the rule is violated by a price restraint that tends to provide the same economic rewards to all practitioners
regardless of their skill, their experience, their training, or their willingness to employ innovative and difficult procedures.”
Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society, 457 U.S., at 348, 102 S.Ct., at 2475. The District Court provided a vivid
example of this system in practice:
“A clear example of the failure of the rights fees paid to respond to market forces occurred in the fall of 1981. On one
weekend of that year, Oklahoma was scheduled to play a football game with the University of Southern California. Both
Oklahoma and USC have long had outstanding football programs, and indeed, both teams were ranked among the top
five teams in the country by the wire service polls. ABC chose to televise the game along with several others on a regional
basis. A game between two schools which are not well-known for their football programs, Citadel and Appalachian State,
was carried on four of ABC's local affiliated stations. The USC–Oklahoma contest was carried on over 200 stations. Yet,
incredibly, all four of these teams received exactly the same amount of money for the right to televise their games.” 546

34 As the District Court observed:
“Perhaps the most pernicious aspect is that under the controls, the market is not responsive to viewer preference. Every
witness who testified on the matter confirmed that the consumers, the viewers of college football television, receive
absolutely no benefit from the controls. Many games for which there is a large viewer demand are kept from the viewers,
and many games for which there is little if any demand are nonetheless televised.” Id., at 1319.
35 Even in the context of professional football, where Congress was willing to pass a limited antitrust exemption, see n. 28,
supra, it was concerned about ensuring that telecasts not be subject to output limitations:
“Mr. GARY. On yesterday I had the opportunity of watching three different games. There were three different games on
three different channels....
“Would this bill prevent them from broadcasting three different games at one time and permit the league to enter into a
contract so that only one game would be permitted?
“Mr. CELLER. The bill does not prevent what the gentleman saw yesterday. As a matter of fact the antitrust exemption
provided by the bill shall not apply to any package contract which prohibits the person to whom league television rights
are sold or transferred from televising any game within any area except the home area of a member club on the day
when that club is playing a home game.
.....
“Mr. GARY. I am an avid sports fan. I follow football, baseball, basketball, and track, and I am very much interested in
all sports. But I am also interested in the people of the United States being able to see on television the games that are
played. I am interested in the television audience. I want to know that they are not going to be prohibited from seeing
games that might otherwise be telecast.
“Mr. CELLER. I can assure the gentleman from Virginia that he need have no fears on that score.” 107 Cong.Rec. 20060
(1961).
36 The impact on competitors is thus analogous to the effect of block booking in the motion picture industry that we concluded
violated the Sherman Act:
“In the first place, they eliminate the possibility of bidding for films theater by theater. In that way they eliminate the
opportunity for the small competitor to obtain the choice first runs, and put a premium on the size of the circuit.” United
States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 U.S. 131, 154, 68 S.Ct. 915, 927, 92 L.Ed. 1260 (1948).
37 546 F.Supp., at 1294. One of respondents' economists illustrated the point:
“[I]t's my opinion that if a free market operated in the market for intercollegiate television of football, that there would be
substantially more regional and even more local games being televised than there are currently. I can take a specific
example from my home state of Indiana.
“I am at Ball State University, which until recently was a division one-A institution, although now is a division one-AA
institution in terms of intercollegiate football. When Ball State plays Indiana State, that is a hotly contested game in an
intrastate sense. That is a prime example of the type of game that probably would be televised. For example, when Ball
State is playing Indiana State at Terre Haute, Indiana, that [would be] a popular game to be televised in the Muncie area,
and, vice versa, in Terre Haute when the game happens to be in Muncie.” App. 506–507.
See also id., at 607–608.
38 Market power is the ability to raise prices above those that would be charged in a competitive market. Jefferson Parish
Hospital Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S., at 27, n. 46, 104 S.Ct., at 1566, n. 46; United States Steel Corp. v. Fortner
Enterprises, 429 U.S. 610, 620, 97 S.Ct. 861, 867, 51 L.Ed.2d 80 (1977); United States v. E.I. duPont de Nemours &
Co., 351 U.S. 377, 391, 76 S.Ct. 994, 1004, 100 L.Ed. 1264 (1956).
39 “The fact that a practice is not categorically unlawful in all or most of its manifestations certainly does not mean that it
is universally lawful. For example, joint buying or selling arrangements are not unlawful per se, but a court would not
hesitate in enjoining a domestic selling arrangement by which, say, Ford and General Motors distributed their automobiles
nationally through a single selling agent. Even without a trial, the judge will know that these two large firms are major
factors in the automobile market, that such joint selling would eliminate important price competition between them,
that they are quite substantial enough to distribute their products independently, and that one can hardly imagine a
pro-competitive justification actually probable in fact or strong enough in principle to make this particular joint selling
arrangement ‘reasonable’ under Sherman Act § 1. The essential point is that the rule of reason can sometimes be applied

40 Moreover, because under the plan member institutions may not compete in terms of price and output, it is manifest that
significant forms of competition are eliminated. See Catalano, Inc. v. Target Sales, Inc., 446 U.S., at 648–649, 100 S.Ct.,

42 The Solicitor General correctly observes:
“There was no need for the respondents to establish monopoly power in any precisely defined market for television
programming in order to prove the restraint unreasonable. Both lower courts found not only that NCAA has power over
the market for intercollegiate sports, but also that in the market for television programming—no matter how broadly or
narrowly the market is defined—the NCAA television restrictions have reduced output, subverted viewer choice, and
distorted pricing. Consequently, unless the controls have some countervailing procompetitive justification, they should
be deemed unlawful regardless of whether petitioner has substantial market power over advertising dollars. While the
‘reasonableness' of a particular alleged restraint often depends on the market power of the parties involved, because a
judgment about market power is the means by which the effects of the conduct on the market place can be assessed,
market power is only one test of ‘reasonableness.’ And where the anticompetitive effects of conduct can be ascertained
through means short of extensive market analysis, and where no countervailing competitive virtues are evident, a lengthy
analysis of market power is not necessary.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19–20 (footnote and citation omitted).

As the District Court observed, id., at 1297, the most analogous programming in terms of the demographic characteristics
of its audience is professional football, and as a condition of its limited exemption from the antitrust laws the professional
football leagues are prohibited from telecasting games at times that conflict with intercollegiate football. See 15 U.S.C.
§ 1293.
We approved of the District Court's reliance on the greater revenue-producing potential and higher television ratings of
championship events as opposed to other events to support its market definition. See 358 U.S., at 250–251, 79 S.Ct.,
at 250.
For the same reasons, it is also apparent that the unique appeal of NCAA football telecasts for viewers means that “from
the standpoint of the consumer—whose interests the statute was especially intended to serve,” Jefferson Parish Hospital
Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S., at 15, 104 S.Ct., at 1559–1560, there can be no doubt that college football constitutes
a separate market for which there is no reasonable substitute. Thus we agree with the District Court that it makes no
difference whether the market is defined from the standpoint of broadcasters, advertisers, or viewers.

53 Compare id., at 1307–1308 (“The colleges are clearly able to negotiate agreements with whatever broadcasters they
choose. We are not dealing with tens of thousands of relatively brief musical works, but with three-hour football games
played eleven times each year”), with Broadcast Music, 441 U.S., at 22–23, 99 S.Ct., at 1564 (footnotes omitted) (“[T]o
the extent the blanket license is a different product, ASCAP is not really a joint sales agency offering the individual goods
of many sellers, but is a separate seller offering its blanket license, of which the individual compositions are raw material.
ASCAP, in short, made a market in which individual composers are inherently unable to compete fully effectively”).
54 Ensuring that individual members of a joint venture are free to increase output has been viewed as central in evaluating
the competitive character of joint ventures. See Brodley, Joint Ventures and Antitrust Policy, 95 Harv.L.Rev. 1523, 1550–
1552, 1555–1560 (1982). See also Note, United Charities and the Sherman Act, 91 Yale L.J. 1593 (1982).
55 If the NCAA faced “interbrand” competition from available substitutes, then certain forms of collective action might be
appropriate in order to enhance its ability to compete. See Continental T.V., Inc., 433 U.S., at 54–57, 97 S.Ct., at 2559–
2561. Our conclusion concerning the availability of substitutes in Part III, supra, forecloses such a justification in this
case, however.
56 The NCAA's plan is not even arguably related to a desire to protect live attendance by ensuring that a game is not
televised in the area where it is to be played. No cooperative action is necessary for that kind of “blackout.” The home
team can always refuse to sell the right to telecast its game to stations in the immediate area. The NCAA does not now
and never has justified its television plan by an interest in assisting schools in “blacking out” their home games in the
areas in which they are played.
57 During this period, the NCAA also expressed its concern to Congress in urging it to limit the antitrust exemption
professional football obtained for telecasting its games to contests not held on Friday or Saturday when such telecasts
might interfere with attendance at intercollegiate games. See H.R.Rep. No. 1178, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., 3–4 (1961); 107
Cong.Rec. 20060–20061 (1961) (remarks of Rep. Celler); id., at 20662; Hearings, supra n. 28, at 66–68 (statement of

“[T]he greatest flaw in the NCAA's argument is that it is manifest that the new plan for football television does not limit
televised football in order to protect gate attendance. The evidence shows that under the new plan, many areas of the
country will have access to nine hours of college football television on several Saturdays in the coming season. Because
the ‘ground rules' eliminate head-to-head programming, a full nine hours of college football will have to be shown on
television during a nine-to-twelve hour period on almost every Saturday of the football season in most of the major
television markets in the country. It can hardly be said that such a plan is devised in order to protect gate attendance.”
Id., at 1296.
Ironically, to the extent that the NCAA's position has merit, it rests on the assumption that football telecasts are a unique
product. If, as the NCAA argues, see supra, at 2965–2966, all television programming is essentially fungible, it would not
be possible to protect attendance without banning all television during the hours at which intercollegiate football games
are held.
See Part II, supra.
It seems unlikely, for example, that there would have been a greater disparity between the football prowess of Ohio State
University and that of Northwestern University in recent years without the NCAA's television plan. The District Court found
that in fact the NCAA has been strikingly unsuccessful if it has indeed attempted to prevent the emergence of a “power
elite” in intercollegiate football. See 546 F.Supp., at 1310–1311. Moreover, the District Court's finding that there would be
more local and regional telecasts without the NCAA controls means that Northwestern could well have generated more
television income in a free market than was obtained under the NCAA regime.
Indeed, the District Court found that the basic reason the television plan has endured is that the NCAA is in effect
controlled by schools that are not restrained by the plan:
“The plaintiffs and other CFA members attempted to persuade the majority of NCAA members that NCAA had gone far
beyond its legitimate role in football television. Not surprisingly, none of the CFA proposals were adopted. Instead the
membership uniformly adopted the proposals of the NCAA administration which ‘legitimized’ NCAA's exercises of power.
The result was not surprising in light of the makeup of the voting membership. Of approximately 800 voting members of
the NCAA, 500 or so are in Divisions II and III and are not subjected to NCAA television controls. Of the 275 Division
I members, only 187 play football, and only 135 were members of Division I–A at the time of the January Convention.

National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n v. Board of Regents of..., 468 U.S. 85 (1984)
104 S.Ct. 2948, 82 L.Ed.2d 70, 1984-2 Trade Cases P 66,139, 18 Ed. Law Rep. 50
Division I–A was made up of the most prominent football-playing schools, and those schools account for most of the
football games shown on network television. Therefore, of some 850 voting members, less than 150 suffer any direct
restriction on their right to sell football games to television.” Id., at 1317.
64 Moreover, the District Court found that those schools which would realize increased revenues in a free market would not
funnel those revenues into their football programs. See id., at 1310.

This is true not only for television viewers, but also for athletes. The District Court's finding that the television exposure
of all schools would increase in the absence of the NCAA's television plan means that smaller institutions appealing to
essentially local or regional markets would get more exposure if the plan is enjoined, enhancing their ability to compete
for student athletes.
Television plans with similar features have been in place since 1951. The 1951–1953 plans were submitted to the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice for review. The Department took the matter “under study,” App. 284–285, and, until
this litigation, has apparently never taken the position that the NCAA's television plans were unlawful.
This litigation was triggered by the NCAA's response to an attempt by the College Football Association (CFA), an
organization of the more dominant football-playing schools and conferences, to develop an independent television plan.
To the extent that its plan contains features similar to those condemned as anticompetitive by the Court, the CFA may
well have antitrust problems of its own. To the extent that they desire continued membership in the NCAA, moreover,
participation in a television plan developed by the CFA will not exempt football powers like respondents from the many
kinds of NCAA controls over television appearances that the Court does not purport to invalidate.
