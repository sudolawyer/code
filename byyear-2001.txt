Because the operation called for filling in some of the ponds, petitioner contacted federal respondents, including the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), to determine if a landfill permit was required under 404(a) of the Clean Water Act (CWA), which authorizes the Corps to issue permits allowing the discharge of dredged or fill material into \"navigable waters.\" The CWA defines \"navigable waters\" as \"the waters of the United States,\" 33 U.S.C.  1362(7), and the Corps' regulations define such waters to include intrastate waters, \"the use, degradation or destruction of which could affect interstate or foreign commerce,\" 33 CFR  328.3(a)(3). In 1986, the Corps attempted to clarify its jurisdiction, stating, in what has been dubbed the \"Migratory Bird Rule,\" that 404(a) extends to intrastate waters that, inter alia, provide habitat for migratory birds. 51 Fed. Reg. 41217. Asserting jurisdiction over the instant site pursuant to that Rule, the Corps refused to issue a 404(a) permit. When petitioner challenged the Corps' jurisdiction and the merits of the permit denial, the District Court granted respondents summary judgment on the jurisdictional issue. The Seventh Circuit held that Congress has authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate intrastate waters and that the Migratory Bird Rule is a reasonable interpretation of the CWA.~      Held: Title 33 CFR  328.3(a)(3), as clarified and applied to petitioner's site pursuant to the Migratory Bird Rule, exceeds the authority granted to respondents under 404(a) of the CWA. Pp. 5_14.~      (a) In United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U.S. 121, this Court held that the Corps had 404(a) jurisdiction over wetlands adjacent to a navigable waterway, noting that the term \"navigable\" is of \"limited import\" and that Congress evidenced its intent to \"regulate at least some waters that would not be deemed `navigable' under [that term's] classical understanding,\" id., at 133. But that holding was based in large measure upon Congress' unequivocal acquiescence to, and approval of, the Corps' regulations interpreting the CWA to cover wetlands adjacent to navigable waters. See id., at 135_139. The Court expressed no opinion on the question of the Corps' authority to regulate wetlands not adjacent to open water, and the statute's text will not allow extension of the Corps' jurisdiction to such wetlands here. Pp. 5_7.~      (b) The Corps' original interpretation of the CWA in its 1974 regulations-which emphasized that a water body's capability of use by the public for transportation or commerce determines whether it is navigable-is inconsistent with that which it espouses here, yet respondents present no persuasive evidence that the Corps mistook Congress' intent in 1974. Respondents contend that whatever its original aim, when Congress amended the CWA in 1977, it approved the more expansive definition of \"navigable waters\" found in the Corps' 1977 regulations. Specifically, respondents submit that Congress' failure to pass legislation that would have overturned the 1977 regulations and the extension of the Environmental Protection Agency's jurisdiction in 404(g) to include waters \"other than\" traditional \"navigable waters\" indicates that Congress recognized and accepted a broad definition of \"navigable waters\" that includes nonnavigable, isolated, intrastate waters. This Court recognizes congressional acquiescence to administrative interpretations of a statute with extreme care. Failed legislative proposals are a particularly dangerous ground on which to rest an interpretation of a prior statute, Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U.S. 164, 187, because a bill can be proposed or rejected for any number of reasons. Here, respondents have failed to make the necessary showing that Congress' failure to pass legislation demonstrates acquiescence to the 1977 regulations or the 1986 Migratory Bird Rule. Section 404(g) is equally unenlightening, for it does not conclusively determine the construction to be placed on the use of the term \"waters\" elsewhere in the CWA. Riverside Bayview Homes, supra, at 138, n. 11. Pp. 7_11.~      (c) Even if 404(a) were not clear, this Court would not extend deference to the Migratory Bird Rule under Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837. Where an administrative interpretation of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems, the Court will construe the statute to avoid such problems unless the construction is plainly contrary to Congress' intent. Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building  Constr. Trades Council, 485 U.S. 568, 575. The grant of authority to Congress under the Commerce Clause, though broad, is not unlimited. See, e.g., United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598. Respondents' arguments, e.g., that the Migratory Bird Rule falls within Congress' power to regulate intrastate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce, raise significant constitutional questions, yet there is nothing approaching a clear statement from Congress that it intended 404(a) to reach an abandoned sand and gravel pit such as the one at issue. Permitting respondents to claim federal jurisdiction over ponds and mudflats falling within the Migratory Bird Rule would also result in a significant impingement of the States' traditional and primary power over land and water use. The Court thus reads the statute as written to avoid such significant constitutional and federalism questions and rejects the request for administrative deference. Pp. 11_14.~      191 F.3d 845, reversed.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT~      Rehnquist, C. J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ., joined. Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.~      Opinion of the Court~      Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      Section 404(a) of the Clean Water Act (CWA or Act), 86 Stat. 884, as amended, 33 U.S.C.  1344(a), regulates the discharge of dredged or fill material into \"navigable waters.\" The United States Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), has interpreted 404(a) to confer federal authority over an abandoned sand and gravel pit in northern Illinois which provides habitat for migratory birds. We are asked to decide whether the provisions of 404(a) may be fairly extended to these waters, and, if so, whether Congress could exercise such authority consistent with the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const., Art. I, 8, cl. 3. We answer the first question in the negative and therefore do not reach the second.~    ~    ~      2~      Petitioner, the Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County (SWANCC), is a consortium of 23 suburban Chicago cities and villages that united in an effort to locate and develop a disposal site for baled nonhazardous solid waste. The Chicago Gravel Company informed the municipalities of the availability of a 533-acre parcel, bestriding the Illinois counties Cook and Kane, which had been the site of a sand and gravel pit mining operation for three decades up until about 1960. Long since abandoned, the old mining site eventually gave way to a successional stage forest, with its remnant excavation trenches evolving into a scattering of permanent and seasonal ponds of varying size (from under one-tenth of an acre to several acres) and depth (from several inches to several feet).~    ~    ~      3~      The municipalities decided to purchase the site for disposal of their baled nonhazardous solid waste. By law, SWANCC was required to file for various permits from Cook County and the State of Illinois before it could begin operation of its balefill project. In addition, because the operation called for the filling of some of the permanent and seasonal ponds, SWANCC contacted federal respondents (hereinafter respondents), including the Corps, to determine if a federal landfill permit was required under 404(a) of the CWA, 33 U.S.C.  1344(a).~    ~    ~      4~      Section 404(a) grants the Corps authority to issue permits \"for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters at specified disposal sites.\" Ibid. The term \"navigable waters\" is defined under the Act as \"the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.\" 1362(7). The Corps has issued regulations defining the term \"waters of the United States\" to include~    ~    ~      5~      \"waters such as intrastate lakes, rivers, streams (including intermittent streams), mudflats, sandflats, wetlands, sloughs, prairie potholes, wet meadows, playa lakes, or natural ponds, the use, degradation or destruction of which could affect interstate or foreign commerce _ .\" 33 CFR  328.3(a)(3) (1999).~    ~    ~      6~      In 1986, in an attempt to \"clarify\" the reach of its jurisdiction, the Corps stated that 404(a) extends to instrastate waters:~    ~    ~      7~      \"a.  Which are or would be used as habitat by birds protected by Migratory Bird Treaties; or~    ~    ~      8~      \"b.  Which are or would be used as habitat by other migratory birds which cross state lines; or~    ~    ~      9~      \"c.  Which are or would be used as habitat for endangered species; or~    ~    ~      10~      \"d.  Used to irrigate crops sold in interstate commerce.\" 51 Fed. Reg. 41217.~    ~    ~      11~      This last promulgation has been dubbed the \"Migratory Bird Rule.\"1~    ~    ~      12~      The Corps initially concluded that it had no jurisdiction over the site because it contained no \"wetlands,\" or areas which support \"vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions,\" 33 CFR  328.3(b) (1999). However, after the Illinois Nature Preserves Commission informed the Corps that a number of migratory bird species had been observed at the site, the Corps reconsidered and ultimately asserted jurisdiction over the balefill site pursuant to subpart (b) of the \"Migratory Bird Rule.\" The Corps found that approximately 121 bird species had been observed at the site, including several known to depend upon aquatic environments for a significant portion of their life requirements. Thus, on November 16, 1987, the Corps formally \"determined that the seasonally ponded, abandoned gravel mining depressions located on the project site, while not wetlands, did qualify as `waters of the United States' _ based upon the following criteria: (1) the proposed site had been abandoned as a gravel mining operation; (2) the water areas and spoil piles had developed a natural character; and (3) the water areas are used as habitat by migratory bird [sic] which cross state lines.\" U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Chicago District, Dept. of Army Permit Evaluation and Decision Document, Lodging of Petitioner, Tab No. 1, p. 6.~    ~    ~      13~      During the application process, SWANCC made several proposals to mitigate the likely displacement of the migratory birds and to preserve a great blue heron rookery located on the site. Its balefill project ultimately received the necessary local and state approval. By 1993, SWANCC had received a special use planned development permit from the Cook County Board of Appeals, a landfill development permit from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, and approval from the Illinois Department of Conservation.~    ~    ~      14~      Despite SWANCC's securing the required water quality certification from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, the Corps refused to issue a 404(a) permit. The Corps found that SWANCC had not established that its proposal was the \"least environmentally damaging, most practicable alternative\" for disposal of nonhazardous solid waste; that SWANCC's failure to set aside sufficient funds to remediate leaks posed an \"unacceptable risk to the public's drinking water supply\"; and that the impact of the project upon area-sensitive species was \"unmitigatable since a landfill surface cannot be redeveloped into a forested habitat.\" Id., at 87.~    ~    ~      15~      Petitioner filed suit under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.  701 et seq., in the Northern District of Illinois challenging both the Corps' jurisdiction over the site and the merits of its denial of the 404(a) permit. The District Court granted summary judgment to respondents on the jurisdictional issue, and petitioner abandoned its challenge to the Corps' permit decision. On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, petitioner renewed its attack on respondents' use of the \"Migratory Bird Rule\" to assert jurisdiction over the site. Petitioner argued that respondents had exceeded their statutory authority in interpreting the CWA to cover nonnavigable, isolated, intrastate waters based upon the presence of migratory birds and, in the alternative, that Congress lacked the power under the Commerce Clause to grant such regulatory jurisdiction.~    ~    ~      16~      The Court of Appeals began its analysis with the constitutional question, holding that Congress has the authority to regulate such waters based upon \"the cumulative impact doctrine, under which a single activity that itself has no discernible effect on interstate commerce may still be regulated if the aggregate effect of that class of activity has a substantial impact on interstate commerce.\" 191 F.3d 845, 850 (CA7 1999). The aggregate effect of the \"destruction of the natural habitat of migratory birds\" on interstate commerce, the court held, was substantial because each year millions of Americans cross state lines and spend over a billion dollars to hunt and observe migratory birds.2 Ibid. The Court of Appeals then turned to the regulatory question. The court held that the CWA reaches as many waters as the Commerce Clause allows and, given its earlier Commerce Clause ruling, it therefore followed that respondents' \"Migratory Bird Rule\" was a reasonable interpretation of the Act. See id., at 851_852.~    ~    ~      17~      We granted certiorari, 529 U.S. 1129 (2000), and now reverse.~    ~    ~      18~      Congress passed the CWA for the stated purpose of \"restor[ing] and maintain[ing] the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters.\" 33 U.S.C.  1251(a). In so doing, Congress chose to \"recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution, to plan the development and use (including restoration, preservation, and enhancement) of land and water resources, and to consult with the Administrator in the exercise of his authority under this chapter.\" 1251(b). Relevant here, 404(a) authorizes respondents to regulate the discharge of fill material into \"navigable waters,\" 33 U.S.C.  1344(a), which the statute defines as \"the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas,\" 1362(7). Respondents have interpreted these words to cover the abandoned gravel pit at issue here because it is used as habitat for migratory birds. We conclude that the \"Migratory Bird Rule\" is not fairly supported by the CWA.~    ~    ~      19~      This is not the first time we have been called upon to evaluate the meaning of 404(a). In United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U.S. 121 (1985), we held that the Corps had 404(a) jurisdiction over wetlands that actually abutted on a navigable waterway. In so doing, we noted that the term \"navigable\" is of \"limited import\" and that Congress evidenced its intent to \"regulate at least some waters that would not be deemed `navigable' under the classical understanding of that term.\" Id., at 133. But our holding was based in large measure upon Congress' unequivocal acquiescence to, and approval of, the Corps' regulations interpreting the CWA to cover wetlands adjacent to navigable waters. See id., at 135_139. We found that Congress' concern for the protection of water quality and aquatic ecosystems indicated its intent to regulate wetlands \"inseparably bound up with the `waters' of the United States.\" Id., at 134.~    ~    ~      20~      It was the significant nexus between the wetlands and \"navigable waters\" that informed our reading of the CWA in Riverside Bayview Homes. Indeed, we did not \"express any opinion\" on the \"question of the authority of the Corps to regulate discharges of fill material into wetlands that are not adjacent to bodies of open water _ .\" Id., at 131_132, n. 8. In order to rule for respondents here, we would have to hold that the jurisdiction of the Corps extends to ponds that are not adjacent to open water. But we conclude that the text of the statute will not allow this.~    ~    ~      21~      Indeed, the Corps' original interpretation of the CWA, promulgated two years after its enactment, is inconsistent with that which it espouses here. Its 1974 regulations defined 404(a)'s \"navigable waters\" to mean \"those waters of the United States which are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide, and/or are presently, or have been in the past, or may be in the future susceptible for use for purposes of interstate or foreign commerce.\" 33 CFR  209.120(d)(1). The Corps emphasized that \"[i]t is the water body's capability of use by the public for purposes of transportation or commerce which is the determinative factor.\" 209.260(e)(1). Respondents put forward no persuasive evidence that the Corps mistook Congress' intent in 1974.3~    ~    ~      22~      Respondents next contend that whatever its original aim in 1972, Congress charted a new course five years later when it approved the more expansive definition of \"navigable waters\" found in the Corps' 1977 regulations. In July 1977, the Corps formally adopted 33 CFR  323.2(a)(5) (1978), which defined \"waters of the United States\" to include \"isolated wetlands and lakes, intermittent streams, prairie potholes, and other waters that are not part of a tributary system to interstate waters or to navigable waters of the United States, the degradation or destruction of which could affect interstate commerce.\" Respondents argue that Congress was aware of this more expansive interpretation during its 1977 amendments to the CWA. Specifically, respondents point to a failed House bill, H. R. 3199, that would have defined \"navigable waters\" as \"all waters which are presently used, or are susceptible to use in their natural condition or by reasonable improvement as a means to transport interstate or foreign commerce.\" 123 Cong. Rec. 10420, 10434 (1977).4 They also point to the passage in 404(g)(1) that authorizes a State to apply to the Environmental Protection Agency for permission \"to administer its own individual and general permit program for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters (other than those waters which are presently used, or are susceptible to use in their natural condition or by reasonable improvement as a means to transport interstate or foreign commerce _ including wetlands adjacent thereto) within its jurisdiction _ .\" 33 U.S.C.  1344(g)(1). The failure to pass legislation that would have overturned the Corps' 1977 regulations and the extension of jurisdiction in 404(g) to waters \"other than\" traditional \"navigable waters,\" respondents submit, indicate that Congress recognized and accepted a broad definition of \"navigable waters\" that includes nonnavigable, isolated, intrastate waters.~    ~    ~      23~      Although we have recognized congressional acquiescence to administrative interpretations of a statute in some situations, we have done so with extreme care.5 \"[F]ailed legislative proposals are `a particularly dangerous ground on which to rest an interpretation of a prior statute.' \" Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U.S. 164, 187 (1994) (quoting Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U.S. 633, 650 (1990)). A bill can be proposed for any number of reasons, and it can be rejected for just as many others. The relationship between the actions and inactions of the 95th Congress and the intent of the 92d Congress in passing 404(a) is also considerably attenuated. Because \"subsequent history is less illuminating than the contemporaneous evidence,\" Hagen v. Utah, 510 U.S. 399, 420 (1994), respondents face a difficult task in overcoming the plain text and import of 404(a).~    ~    ~      24~      We conclude that respondents have failed to make the necessary showing that the failure of the 1977 House bill demonstrates Congress' acquiescence to the Corps' regulations or the \"Migratory Bird Rule,\" which, of course, did not first appear until 1986. Although respondents cite some legislative history showing Congress' recognition of the Corps' assertion of jurisdiction over \"isolated waters,\"6 as we explained in Riverside Bayview Homes, \"[i]n both Chambers, debate on the proposals to narrow the definition of navigable waters centered largely on the issue of wetlands preservation.\" 474 U.S., at 136. Beyond Congress' desire to regulate wetlands adjacent to \"navigable waters,\" respondents point us to no persuasive evidence that the House bill was proposed in response to the Corps' claim of jurisdiction over nonnavigable, isolated, intrastate waters or that its failure indicated congressional acquiescence to such jurisdiction.~    ~    ~      25~      Section 404(g) is equally unenlightening. In Riverside Bayview Homes we recognized that Congress intended the phrase \"navigable waters\" to include \"at least some waters that would not be deemed `navigable' under the classical understanding of that term.\" Id., at 133. But 404(g) gives no intimation of what those waters might be; it simply refers to them as \"other _ waters.\" Respondents conjecture that \"other _ waters\" must incorporate the Corps' 1977 regulations, but it is also plausible, as petitioner contends, that Congress simply wanted to include all waters adjacent to \"navigable waters,\" such as nonnavigable tributaries and streams. The exact meaning of 404(g) is not before us and we express no opinion on it, but for present purposes it is sufficient to say, as we did in Riverside Bayview Homes, that \"404(g)(1) does not conclusively determine the construction to be placed on the use of the term `waters' elsewhere in the Act (particularly in 502(7), which contains the relevant definition of `navigable waters') _ .\" Id., at 138, n. 11.7~    ~    ~      26~      We thus decline respondents' invitation to take what they see as the next ineluctable step after Riverside Bayview Homes: holding that isolated ponds, some only seasonal, wholly located within two Illinois counties, fall under 404(a)'s definition of \"navigable waters\" because they serve as habitat for migratory birds. As counsel for respondents conceded at oral argument, such a ruling would assume that \"the use of the word navigable in the statute _ does not have any independent significance.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 28. We cannot agree that Congress' separate definitional use of the phrase \"waters of the United States\" constitutes a basis for reading the term \"navigable waters\" out of the statute. We said in Riverside Bayview Homes that the word \"navigable\" in the statute was of \"limited effect\" and went on to hold that 404(a) extended to nonnavigable wetlands adjacent to open waters. But it is one thing to give a word limited effect and quite another to give it no effect whatever. The term \"navigable\" has at least the import of showing us what Congress had in mind as its authority for enacting the CWA: its traditional jurisdiction over waters that were or had been navigable in fact or which could reasonably be so made. See, e.g., United States v. Appalachian Elec. Power Co., 311 U.S. 377, 407_408 (1940).~    ~    ~      27~      Respondents-relying upon all of the arguments addressed above-contend that, at the very least, it must be said that Congress did not address the precise question of 404(a)'s scope with regard to nonnavigable, isolated, intrastate waters, and that, therefore, we should give deference to the \"Migratory Bird Rule.\" See, e.g., Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984). We find 404(a) to be clear, but even were we to agree with respondents, we would not extend Chevron deference here.~    ~    ~      28~      Where an administrative interpretation of a statute invokes the outer limits of Congress' power, we expect a clear indication that Congress intended that result. See Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building  Constr. Trades Council, 485 U.S. 568, 575 (1988). This requirement stems from our prudential desire not to needlessly reach constitutional issues and our assumption that Congress does not casually authorize administrative agencies to interpret a statute to push the limit of congressional authority. See ibid. This concern is heightened where the administrative interpretation alters the federal-state framework by permitting federal encroachment upon a traditional state power. See United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 349 (1971) (\"[U]nless Congress conveys its purpose clearly, it will not be deemed to have significantly changed the federal-state balance\"). Thus, \"where an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems, the Court will construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress.\" DeBartolo, supra, at 575.~    ~    ~      29~      Twice in the past six years we have reaffirmed the proposition that the grant of authority to Congress under the Commerce Clause, though broad, is not unlimited. See United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000); United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995). Respondents argue that the \"Migratory Bird Rule\" falls within Congress' power to regulate intrastate activities that \"substantially affect\" interstate commerce. They note that the protection of migratory birds is a \"national interest of very nearly the first magnitude,\" Missouri v. Holland, 252 U.S. 416, 435 (1920), and that, as the Court of Appeals found, millions of people spend over a billion dollars annually on recreational pursuits relating to migratory birds. These arguments raise significant constitutional questions. For example, we would have to evaluate the precise object or activity that, in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce. This is not clear, for although the Corps has claimed jurisdiction over petitioner's land because it contains water areas used as habitat by migratory birds, respondents now, post litem motam, focus upon the fact that the regulated activity is petitioner's municipal landfill, which is \"plainly of a commercial nature.\" Brief for Federal Respondents 43. But this is a far cry, indeed, from the \"navigable waters\" and \"waters of the United States\" to which the statute by its terms extends.~    ~    ~      30~      These are significant constitutional questions raised by respondents' application of their regulations, and yet we find nothing approaching a clear statement from Congress that it intended 404(a) to reach an abandoned sand and gravel pit such as we have here. Permitting respondents to claim federal jurisdiction over ponds and mudflats falling within the \"Migratory Bird Rule\" would result in a significant impingement of the States' traditional and primary power over land and water use. See, e.g., Hess v. Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation, 513 U.S. 30, 44 (1994) (\"[R]egulation of land use [is] a function traditionally performed by local governments\"). Rather than expressing a desire to readjust the federal-state balance in this manner, Congress chose to \"recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of States _ to plan the development and use _ of land and water resources _ .\" 33 U.S.C.  1251(b). We thus read the statute as written to avoid the significant constitutional and federalism questions raised by respondents' interpretation, and therefore reject the request for administrative deference.8~    ~    ~      31~      We hold that 33 CFR  328.3(a)(3) (1999), as clarified and applied to petitioner's balefill site pursuant to the \"Migratory Bird Rule,\" 51 Fed. Reg. 41217 (1986), exceeds the authority granted to respondents under 404(a) of the CWA. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is therefore~    ~    ~      32~      Reversed.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~          The Corps issued the \"Migratory Bird Rule\" without following the notice and comment procedures outlined in the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.  553.~      ~      ~        2~          Relying upon its earlier decision in Hoffman Homes, Inc. v. EPA, 999 F.2d 256 (CA7 1993), and a report from the United States Census Bureau, the Court of Appeals found that in 1996 approximately 3.1 million Americans spent $1.3 billion to hunt migratory birds (with 11 percent crossing state lines to do so) as another 17.7 million Americans observed migratory birds (with 9.5 million traveling for the purpose of observing shorebirds). See 191 F.3d, at 850.~      ~      ~        3~          Respondents refer us to portions of the legislative history that they believe indicate Congress' intent to expand the definition of \"navigable waters.\" Although the Conference Report includes the statement that the conferees \"intend that the term `navigable waters' be given the broadest possible constitutional interpretation,\" S. Conf. Rep. No. 92_1236, p. 144 (1972), neither this, nor anything else in the legislative history to which respondents point, signifies that Congress intended to exert anything more than its commerce power over navigation. Indeed, respondents admit that the legislative history is somewhat ambiguous. See Brief for Federal Respondents 24.~      ~      ~        4~          While this bill passed in the House, a similarly worded amendment to a bill originating in the Senate, S. 1952, failed. See 123 Cong. Rec. 26710, 26728 (1977).~      ~      ~        5~          In Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461 U.S. 574, 595, 600_601 (1983), for example, we upheld an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Revenue Ruling that revoked the tax-exempt status of private schools practicing racial discrimination because the IRS' interpretation of the relevant statutes was \"correct\"; because Congress had held \"hearings on this precise issue,\" making it \"hardly conceivable that Congress-and in this setting, any Member of Congress-was not abundantly aware of what was going on\"; and because \"no fewer than 13 bills introduced to overturn the IRS interpretation\" had failed. Absent such overwhelming evidence of acquiescence, we are loath to replace the plain text and original understanding of a statute with an amended agency interpretation. See Consumer Product Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.S. 102, 118, n. 13 (1980) (\"[E]ven when it would otherwise be useful, subsequent legislative history will rarely override a reasonable interpretation of a statute that can be gleaned from its language and legislative history prior to its enactment\").~      ~      ~        6~          Respondents cite, for example, the Senate Report on S. 1952, which referred to the Corps' \"isolated waters\" regulation. See S. Rep. No. 95_370, p. 75 (1977). However, the same report reiterated that \"[t]he committee amendment does not redefine navigable waters.\" Ibid.~      ~      ~        7~          Respondents also make a passing reference to Congress' decision in 1977 to exempt certain types of discharges from 404(a), including, for example, \"discharge of dredged or fill material _ for the purpose of construction or maintenance of farm or stock ponds or irrigation ditches, or the maintenance of drainage ditches.\" 67, 91 Stat. 1600, 33 U.S.C.  1344(f)(C). As 404(a) only regulates dredged or fill material that is discharged \"into navigable waters,\" Congress' decision to exempt certain types of these discharges does not affect, much less address, the definition of \"navigable waters.\"~      ~      ~        8~          Because violations of the CWA carry criminal penalties, see 33 U.S.C.  1319(c)(2), petitioner invokes the rule of lenity as another basis for rejecting the Corps' interpretation of the CWA. Brief for Petitioner 31_32. We need not address this alternative argument. See United States v. Shabani, 513 U.S. 10, 17 (1994).~      ~    ~    ~      33~      Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.~    ~    ~      34~      In 1969, the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, Ohio, coated with a slick of industrial waste, caught fire. Congress responded to that dramatic event, and to others like it, by enacting the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 817, as amended 33 U.S.C.  1251 et seq., commonly known as the Clean Water Act (Clean Water Act, CWA, or Act).1 The Act proclaimed the ambitious goal of ending water pollution by 1985. 1251(a). The Court's past interpretations of the CWA have been fully consistent with that goal. Although Congress' vision of zero pollution remains unfulfilled, its pursuit has unquestionably retarded the destruction of the aquatic environment. Our Nation's waters no longer burn. Today, however, the Court takes an unfortunate step that needlessly weakens our principal safeguard against toxic water.~    ~    ~      35~      It is fair to characterize the Clean Water Act as \"watershed\" legislation. The statute endorsed fundamental changes in both the purpose and the scope of federal regulation of the Nation's waters. In 13 of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899 (RHA), 30 Stat. 1152, as amended, 33 U.S.C.  407 Congress had assigned to the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) the mission of regulating discharges into certain waters in order to protect their use as highways for the transportation of interstate and foreign commerce; the scope of the Corps' jurisdiction under the RHA accordingly extended only to waters that were \"navigable.\" In the CWA, however, Congress broadened the Corps' mission to include the purpose of protecting the quality of our Nation's waters for esthetic, health, recreational, and environmental uses. The scope of its jurisdiction was therefore redefined to encompass all of \"the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.\" 1362(7). That definition requires neither actual nor potential navigability.~    ~    ~      36~      The Court has previously held that the Corps' broadened jurisdiction under the CWA properly included an 80- acre parcel of low-lying marshy land that was not itself navigable, directly adjacent to navigable water, or even hydrologically connected to navigable water, but which was part of a larger area, characterized by poor drainage, that ultimately abutted a navigable creek. United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U.S. 121 (1985).2 Our broad finding in Riverside Bayview that the 1977 Congress had acquiesced in the Corps' understanding of its jurisdiction applies equally to the 410-acre parcel at issue here. Moreover, once Congress crossed the legal watershed that separates navigable streams of commerce from marshes and inland lakes, there is no principled reason for limiting the statute's protection to those waters or wetlands that happen to lie near a navigable stream.~    ~    ~      37~      In its decision today, the Court draws a new jurisdictional line, one that invalidates the 1986 migratory bird regulation as well as the Corps' assertion of jurisdiction over all waters except for actually navigable waters, their tributaries, and wetlands adjacent to each. Its holding rests on two equally untenable premises: (1) that when Congress passed the 1972 CWA, it did not intend \"to exert anything more than its commerce power over navigation,\" ante, at 7, n. 3; and (2) that in 1972 Congress drew the boundary defining the Corps' jurisdiction at the odd line on which the Court today settles.~    ~    ~      38~      As I shall explain, the text of the 1972 amendments affords no support for the Court's holding, and amendments Congress adopted in 1977 do support the Corps' present interpretation of its mission as extending to so-called \"isolated\" waters. Indeed, simple common sense cuts against the particular definition of the Corps' jurisdiction favored by the majority.~    ~    ~      39~      * The significance of the FWPCA Amendments of 1972 is illuminated by a reference to the history of federal water regulation, a history that the majority largely ignores. Federal regulation of the Nation's waters began in the 19th century with efforts targeted exclusively at \"promot[ing] water transportation and commerce.\" Kalen, Commerce to Conservation: The Call for a National Water Policy and the Evolution of Federal Jurisdiction Over Wetlands, 69 N. D. L. Rev. 873, 877 (1993). This goal was pursued through the various Rivers and Harbors Acts, the most comprehensive of which was the RHA of 1899.3 Section 13 of the 1899 RHA, commonly known as the Refuse Act, prohibited the discharge of \"refuse\" into any \"navigable water\" or its tributaries, as well as the deposit of \"refuse\" on the bank of a navigable water \"whereby navigation shall or may be impeded or obstructed\" without first obtaining a permit from the Secretary of the Army. 30 Stat. 1152.~    ~    ~      40~      During the middle of the 20th century, the goals of federal water regulation began to shift away from an exclusive focus on protecting navigability and toward a concern for preventing environmental degradation. Kalen, 69 N. D. L. Rev., at 877_879, and n. 30. This awakening of interest in the use of federal power to protect the aquatic environment was helped along by efforts to reinterpret 13 of the RHA in order to apply its permit requirement to industrial discharges into navigable waters, even when such discharges did nothing to impede navigability. See, e.g., United States v. Republic Steel Corp., 362 U.S. 482, 490_491 (1960) (noting that the term \"refuse\" in 13 was broad enough to include industrial waste).4 Seeds of this nascent concern with pollution control can also be found in the FWPCA, which was first enacted in 1948 and then incrementally expanded in the following years.5~    ~    ~      41~      The shift in the focus of federal water regulation from protecting navigability toward environmental protection reached a dramatic climax in 1972, with the passage of the CWA. The Act, which was passed as an amendment to the existing FWPCA, was universally described by its supporters as the first truly comprehensive federal water pollution legislation. The \"major purpose\" of the CWA was \"to establish a comprehensive long-range policy for the elimination of water pollution.\" S. Rep. No. 92_414, p. 95 (1971), reprinted in 2 Legislative History of the Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (Committee Print compiled for the Senate Committee on Public Works by the Library of Congress), Ser. No. 93_1, p. 1511 (1971) (hereinafter Leg. Hist.) (emphasis added). And \"[n]o Congressman's remarks on the legislation were complete without reference to [its] `comprehensive' nature _ .\" Milwaukee v. Illinois, 451 U.S. 304, 318 (1981) (Rehnquist, J.). A House sponsor described the bill as \"the most comprehensive and far-reaching water pollution bill we have ever drafted,\" 1 Leg. Hist. 369 (Rep. Mizell), and Senator Randolph, Chairman of the Committee on Public Works, stated: \"It is perhaps the most comprehensive legislation that the Congress of the United States has ever developed in this particular field of the environment.\" 2 id., at 1269. This Court was therefore undoubtedly correct when it described the 1972 amendments as establishing \"a comprehensive program for controlling and abating water pollution.\" Train v. City of New York, 420 U.S. 35, 37 (1975).~    ~    ~      42~      Section 404 of the CWA resembles 13 of the RHA, but, unlike the earlier statute, the primary purpose of which is the maintenance of navigability, 404 was principally intended as a pollution control measure. A comparison of the contents of the RHA and the 1972 Act vividly illustrates the fundamental difference between the purposes of the two provisions. The earlier statute contains pages of detailed appropriations for improvements in specific navigation facilities, 30 Stat. 1121_1149, for studies concerning the feasibility of a canal across the Isthmus of Panama, id., at 1150, and for surveys of the advisability of harbor improvements at numerous other locations, id., at 1155_1161. Tellingly, 13, which broadly prohibits the discharge of refuse into navigable waters, contains an exception for refuse \"flowing from streets and sewers . . . in a liquid state.\" Id., at 1152.~    ~    ~      43~      The 1972 Act, in contrast, appropriated large sums of money for research and related programs for water pollution control, 86 Stat. 816_833, and for the construction of water treatment works, id., at 833_844. Strikingly absent from its declaration of \"goals and policy\" is any reference to avoiding or removing obstructions to navigation. Instead, the principal objective of the Act, as stated by Congress in 101, was \"to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters.\" 33 U.S.C.  1251. Congress therefore directed federal agencies in 102 to \"develop comprehensive programs for preventing, reducing, or eliminating the pollution of the navigable waters and ground waters and improving the sanitary condition of surface and underground waters.\" 33 U.S.C.  1252. The CWA commands federal agencies to give \"due regard,\" not to the interest of unobstructed navigation, but rather to \"improvements which are necessary to conserve such waters for the protection and propagation of fish and aquatic life and wildlife [and] recreational purposes.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      44~      Because of the statute's ambitious and comprehensive goals, it was, of course, necessary to expand its jurisdictional scope. Thus, although Congress opted to carry over the traditional jurisdictional term \"navigable waters\" from the RHA and prior versions of the FWPCA, it broadened the definition of that term to encompass all \"waters of the United States.\" 1362(7).6 Indeed, the 1972 conferees arrived at the final formulation by specifically deleting the word \"navigable\" from the definition that had originally appeared in the House version of the Act.7 The majority today undoes that deletion.~    ~    ~      45~      The Conference Report explained that the definition in 502(7) was intended to \"be given the broadest possible constitutional interpretation.\" S. Conf. Rep. No. 92_1236, p. 144 (1972), reprinted in 1 Leg. Hist. 327. The Court dismisses this clear assertion of legislative intent with the back of its hand. Ante, at 7, n. 3. The statement, it claims, \"signifies that Congress intended to exert [nothing] more than its commerce power over navigation.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      46~      The majority's reading drains all meaning from the conference amendment. By 1972, Congress' Commerce Clause power over \"navigation\" had long since been established. The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557 (1871); Gilman v. Philadelphia, 3 Wall. 713 (1866); Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1 (1824). Why should Congress intend that its assertion of federal jurisdiction be given the \"broadest possible constitutional interpretation\" if it did not intend to reach beyond the very heartland of its commerce power? The activities regulated by the CWA have nothing to do with Congress' \"commerce power over navigation.\" Indeed, the goals of the 1972 statute have nothing to do with navigation at all.~    ~    ~      47~      As we recognized in Riverside Bayview, the interests served by the statute embrace the protection of \" `significant natural biological functions, including food chain production, general habitat, and nesting, spawning, rearing and resting sites' \" for various species of aquatic wildlife. 474 U.S., at 134_135. For wetlands and \"isolated\" inland lakes, that interest is equally powerful, regardless of the proximity of the swamp or the water to a navigable stream. Nothing in the text, the stated purposes, or the legislative history of the CWA supports the conclusion that in 1972 Congress contemplated-much less commanded-the odd jurisdictional line that the Court has drawn today.~    ~    ~      48~      The majority accuses respondents of reading the term \"navigable\" out of the statute. Ante, at 11. But that was accomplished by Congress when it deleted the word from the 502(7) definition. After all, it is the definition that is the appropriate focus of our attention. Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore., 515 U.S. 687, 697_698, n. 10 (1995) (refusing to be guided by the common-law definition of the term \"take\" when construing that term within the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and looking instead to the meaning of the terms contained in the definition of \"take\" supplied by the statute). Moreover, a proper understanding of the history of federal water pollution regulation makes clear that-even on respondents' broad reading-the presence of the word \"navigable\" in the statute is not inexplicable. The term was initially used in the various Rivers and Harbors Acts because (1) at the time those statutes were first enacted, Congress' power over the Nation's waters was viewed as extending only to \"water bodies that were deemed `navigable' and therefore suitable for moving goods to or from markets,\" Power 513; and (2) those statutes had the primary purpose of protecting navigation. Congress' choice to employ the term \"navigable waters\" in the 1972 Clean Water Act simply continued nearly a century of usage. Viewed in light of the history of federal water regulation, the broad 502(7) definition, and Congress' unambiguous instructions in the Conference Report, it is clear that the term \"navigable waters\" operates in the statute as a shorthand for \"waters over which federal authority may properly be asserted.\"~    ~    II~    ~      49~      As the majority correctly notes, ante, at 7, when the Corps first promulgated regulations pursuant to 404 of the 1972 Act, it construed its authority as being essentially the same as it had been under the 1899 RHA.8 The reaction to those regulations in the federal courts,9 in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),10 and in Congress,11 convinced the Corps that the statute required it \"to protect water quality to the full extent of the [C]ommerce [C]lause\" and to extend federal regulation over discharges \"to many areas that have never before been subject to Federal permits or to this form of water quality protection.\" 40 Fed. Reg. 31320 (1975).~    ~    ~      50~      In 1975, the Corps therefore adopted the interim regulations that we upheld in Riverside Bayview. As we noted in that case, the new regulations understood \"the waters of the United States\" to include, not only navigable waters and their tributaries, but also \"nonnavigable intrastate waters whose use or misuse could affect interstate commerce.\" 474 U.S., at 123. The 1975 regulations provided that the new program would become effective in three phases: phase 1, which became effective immediately, encompassed the navigable waters covered by the 1974 regulation and the RHA; phase 2, effective after July 1, 1976, extended Corps jurisdiction to nonnavigable tributaries, freshwater wetlands adjacent to primary navigable waters, and lakes; and phase 3, effective after July 1, 1977, extended Corps jurisdiction to all other waters covered under the statute, including any waters not covered by phases 1 and 2 (such as \"intermittent rivers, streams, tributaries, and perched wetlands that are not contiguous or adjacent to navigable waters\") that \"the District Engineer determines necessitate regulation for the protection of water quality.\" 40 Fed. Reg. 31325_31326 (1975). The final version of these regulations, adopted in 1977, made clear that the covered waters included \"isolated lakes and wetlands, intermittent streams, prairie potholes, and other waters that are not part of a tributary system to interstate waters or to navigable waters of the United States, the degradation or destruction of which could affect interstate commerce.\"12~    ~    ~      51~      The Corps' broadened reading of its jurisdiction provoked opposition among some Members of Congress. As a result, in 1977, Congress considered a proposal that would have limited the Corps' jurisdiction under 404 to waters that are used, or by reasonable improvement could be used, as a means to transport interstate or foreign commerce and their adjacent wetlands. H. R. 3199, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., 16(f) (1977). A bill embodying that proposal passed the House but was defeated in the Senate. The debates demonstrate that Congress was fully aware of the Corps' understanding of the scope of its jurisdiction under the 1972 Act. We summarized these debates in our opinion in Riverside Bayview:~    ~    ~      52~      \"In both Chambers, debate on the proposals to narrow the definition of navigable waters centered largely on the issue of wetlands preservation. See [123 Cong. Rec.], at 10426_10432 (House debate); id., at 26710_26729 (Senate debate). Proponents of a more limited 404 jurisdiction contended that the Corps' assertion of jurisdiction over wetlands and other nonnavigable `waters' had far exceeded what Congress had intended in enacting 404. Opponents of the proposed changes argued that a narrower definition of `navigable waters' for purposes of 404 would exclude vast stretches of crucial wetlands from the Corps' jurisdiction, with detrimental effects on wetlands ecosystems, water quality, and the aquatic environment generally. The debate, particularly in the Senate, was lengthy. In the House, the debate ended with the adoption of a narrowed definition of `waters'; but in the Senate the limiting amendment was defeated and the old definition retained. The Conference Committee adopted the Senate's approach: efforts to narrow the definition of `waters' were abandoned; the legislation as ultimately passed, in the words of Senator Baker, `retain[ed] the comprehensive jurisdiction over the Nation's waters exercised in the 1972 Federal Water Pollution Control Act.' \" 474 U.S., at 136_137.~    ~    ~      53~      The net result of that extensive debate was a congressional endorsement of the position that the Corps maintains today. We explained in Riverside Bayview:~    ~    ~      54~      \"[T]he scope of the Corps' asserted jurisdiction over wetlands was specifically brought to Congress' attention, and Congress rejected measures designed to curb the Corps' jurisdiction in large part because of its concern that protection of wetlands would be unduly hampered by a narrowed definition of `navigable waters.' Although we are chary of attributing significance to Congress' failure to act, a refusal by Congress to overrule an agency's construction of legislation is at least some evidence of the reasonableness of that construction, particularly where the administrative construction has been brought to Congress' attention through legislation specifically designed to supplant it.\" Id., at 137.~    ~    ~      55~      Even if the majority were correct that Congress did not extend the Corps' jurisdiction in the 1972 CWA to reach beyond navigable waters and their nonnavigable tributaries, Congress' rejection of the House's efforts in 1977 to cut back on the Corps' 1975 assertion of jurisdiction clearly indicates congressional acquiescence in that assertion. Indeed, our broad determination in Riverside Bayview that the 1977 Congress acquiesced in the very regulations at issue in this case should foreclose petitioner's present urgings to the contrary. The majority's refusal in today's decision to acknowledge the scope of our prior decision is troubling. Compare id., at 136 (\"Congress acquiesced in the [1975] administrative construction [of the Corps' jurisdiction]\"), with ante, at 9 (\"We conclude that respondents have failed to make the necessary showing that the failure of the 1977 House bill demonstrates Congress' acquiescence to the Corps' regulations _\").13 Having already concluded that Congress acquiesced in the Corps' regulatory definition of its jurisdiction, the Court is wrong to reverse course today. See Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428, 443 (2000) (Rehnquist, C. J.) (\" `[T]he doctrine [of stare decisis] carries such persuasive force that we have always required a departure from precedent to be supported by some \"special justification\" ' \").~    ~    ~      56~      More important than the 1977 bill that did not become law are the provisions that actually were included in the 1977 revisions. Instead of agreeing with those who sought to withdraw the Corps' jurisdiction over \"isolated\" waters, Congress opted to exempt several classes of such waters from federal control. 67, 91 Stat. 1601, 33 U.S.C.  1344(f). For example, the 1977 amendments expressly exclude from the Corps' regulatory power the discharge of fill material \"for the purpose of construction or maintenance of farm or stock ponds or irrigation ditches, or the maintenance of drainage ditches,\" and \"for the purpose of construction of temporary sedimentation basins on a construction site which does not include placement of fill material into the navigable waters.\" Ibid. The specific exemption of these waters from the Corps' jurisdiction indicates that the 1977 Congress recognized that similarly \"isolated\" waters not covered by the exceptions would fall within the statute's outer limits.~    ~    ~      57~      In addition to the enumerated exceptions, the 1977 amendments included a new section, 404(g), which authorized the States to administer their own permit programs over certain nonnavigable waters. Section 404(g)(1) provides, in relevant part:~    ~    ~      58~      \"The Governor of any State desiring to administer its own individual and general permit program for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters (other than those waters which are presently used, or are susceptible to use in their natural condition or by reasonable improvement as a means to transport interstate or foreign commerce . . . , including wetlands adjacent thereto) within its jurisdiction may submit to the Administrator a full and complete description of the program it proposes to establish and administer under State law or under an interstate compact.\" 33 U.S.C.  1344(g)(1).~    ~    ~      59~      Section 404(g)(1)'s reference to navigable waters \"other than those waters which are presently used, or are susceptible to use\" for transporting commerce and their adjacent wetlands appears to suggest that Congress viewed (and accepted) the Act's regulations as covering more than navigable waters in the traditional sense. The majority correctly points out that 404(g)(1) is itself ambiguous because it does not indicate precisely how far Congress considered federal jurisdiction to extend. Ante, at 10. But the Court ignores the provision's legislative history, which makes clear that Congress understood 404(g)(1)-and therefore federal jurisdiction-to extend, not only to navigable waters and nonnavigable tributaries, but also to \"isolated\" waters, such as those at issue in this case.~    ~    ~      60~      The Conference Report discussing the 1977 amendments, for example, states that 404(g) \"establish[es] a process to allow the Governor of any State to administer an individual and general permit program for the discharge of dredged or fill material into phase 2 and 3 waters after the approval of a program by the Administrator.\" H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 95_830, p. 101 (1977), reprinted in 3 Legislative History of the Clean Water Act of 1977 (Committee Print Compiled for the Committee on Environment and Public Works by the Library of Congress), Ser. No. 95_14, p. 285 (emphasis added) (hereinafter Leg. Hist. of CWA). Similarly, a Senate Report discussing the 1977 amendments explains that, under 404(g), \"the [C]orps will continue to administer the section 404 permit program in all navigable waters for a discharge of dredge or fill material until the approval of a State program for phase 2 and 3 waters.\" S. Rep. No. 95_370, p. 75 (1977), reprinted in 4 Leg. Hist. of CWA 708 (emphases added).~    ~    ~      61~      Of course, as I have already discussed, \"phase 1\" waters are navigable waters and their contiguous wetlands, \"phase 2\" waters are the \"primary tributaries\" of navigable waters and their adjacent wetlands, and \"phase 3\" waters are all other waters covered by the statute, and can include such \"isolated\" waters as \"intermittent rivers, streams, tributaries, and perched wetlands that are not contiguous or adjacent to navigable waters.\" The legislative history of the 1977 amendments therefore plainly establishes that, when it enacted 404(g), Congress believed-and desired-the Corps' jurisdiction to extend beyond just navigable waters, their tributaries, and the wetlands adjacent to each.~    ~    ~      62~      In dismissing the significance of 404(g)(1), the majority quotes out of context language in the very same 1977 Senate Report that I have quoted above. Ante, at 10, n. 6. It is true that the Report states that \"[t]he committee amendment does not redefine navigable waters.\" S. Rep. No. 95_370, at 75, reprinted in 4 Leg. Hist. of CWA 708 (emphasis added). But the majority fails to point out that the quoted language appears in the course of an explanation of the Senate's refusal to go along with House efforts to narrow the scope of the Corps' CWA jurisdiction to traditionally navigable waters. Thus, the immediately preceding sentence warns that \"[t]o limit the jurisdiction of the [FWPCA] with reference to discharges of the pollutants of dredged or fill material would cripple efforts to achieve the act's objectives.\"14 Ibid. The Court would do well to heed that warning.~    ~    ~      63~      The majority also places great weight, ante, at 10, on our statement in Riverside Bayview that 404(g) \"does not conclusively determine the construction to be placed on the use of the term `waters' elsewhere in the Act,\" 474 U.S., at 138, n. 11 (emphasis added). This is simply more selective reading. In that case, we also went on to say with respect to the significance of 404(g) that \"the various provisions of the Act should be read in pari materia.\" Ibid. More-over, our ultimate conclusion in Riverside Bayview was that 404(g) \"suggest[s] strongly that the term `waters' as used in the Act\" supports the Corps' reading. Ibid.~    ~    III~    ~      64~      Although it might have appeared problematic on a \"linguistic\" level for the Corps to classify \"lands\" as \"waters\" in Riverside Bayview, 474 U.S., at 131_132, we squarely held that the agency's construction of the statute that it was charged with enforcing was entitled to deference under Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984). Today, however, the majority refuses to extend such deference to the same agency's construction of the same statute, see ante, at 11_13. This refusal is unfaithful to both Riverside Bayview and Chevron. For it is the majority's reading, not the agency's, that does violence to the scheme Congress chose to put into place.~    ~    ~      65~      Contrary to the Court's suggestion, the Corps' interpretation of the statute does not \"encroac[h]\" upon \"traditional state power\" over land use. Ante, at 12. \"Land use planning in essence chooses particular uses for the land; environmental regulation, at its core, does not mandate particular uses of the land but requires only that, however the land is used, damage to the environment is kept within prescribed limits.\" California Coastal Comm'n v. Granite Rock Co., 480 U.S. 572, 587 (1987). The CWA is not a land-use code; it is a paradigm of environmental regulation. Such regulation is an accepted exercise of federal power. Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining  Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U.S. 264, 282 (1981).~    ~    ~      66~      It is particularly ironic for the Court to raise the specter of federalism while construing a statute that makes explicit efforts to foster local control over water regulation. Faced with calls to cut back on federal jurisdiction over water pollution, Congress rejected attempts to narrow the scope of that jurisdiction and, by incorporating 404(g), opted instead for a scheme that encouraged States to supplant federal control with their own regulatory programs. S. Rep. No. 95_370, at 75, reprinted in 4 Leg. Hist. of CWA 708 (\"The committee amendment does not redefine navigable waters. Instead, the committee amendment intends to assure continued protection of all the Nation's waters, but allows States to assume the primary responsibility for protecting those lakes, rivers, streams, swamps, marshes, and other portions of the navigable waters outside the [C]orps program in the so-called phase I waters\" (emphasis added)). Because Illinois could have taken advantage of the opportunities offered to it through 404(g), the federalism concerns to which the majority adverts are misplaced.     The Corps' interpretation of the statute as extending beyond navigable waters, tributaries of navigable waters, and wetlands adjacent to each is manifestly reasonable and therefore entitled to deference.~    ~    IV~    ~      67~      Because I am convinced that the Court's miserly construction of the statute is incorrect, I shall comment briefly on petitioner's argument that Congress is without power to prohibit it from filling any part of the 31 acres of ponds on its property in Cook County, Illinois. The Corps' exercise of its 404 permitting power over \"isolated\" waters that serve as habitat for migratory birds falls well within the boundaries set by this Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence.~    ~    ~      68~      In United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 558_559 (1995), this Court identified \"three broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power\": (1) channels of interstate commerce; (2) instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons and things in interstate commerce; and (3) activities that \"substantially affect\" interstate commerce. Ibid. The migratory bird rule at issue here is properly analyzed under the third category. In order to constitute a proper exercise of Congress' power over intrastate activities that \"substantially affect\" interstate commerce, it is not necessary that each individual instance of the activity substantially affect commerce; it is enough that, taken in the aggregate, the class of activities in question has such an effect. Perez v. United States, 402 U.S. 146 (1971) (noting that it is the \"class\" of regulated activities, not the individual instance, that is to be considered in the \"affects\" commerce analysis); see also Hodel, 452 U.S., at 277; Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 127_128 (1942).~    ~    ~      69~      The activity being regulated in this case (and by the Corps' 404 regulations in general) is the discharge of fill material into water. The Corps did not assert jurisdiction over petitioner's land simply because the waters were \"used as habitat by migratory birds.\" It asserted jurisdiction because petitioner planned to discharge fill into waters \"used as habitat by migratory birds.\" Had petitioner intended to engage in some other activity besides discharging fill (i.e., had there been no activity to regulate), or, conversely, had the waters not been habitat for migratory birds (i.e., had there been no basis for federal jurisdiction), the Corps would never have become involved in petitioner's use of its land. There can be no doubt that, unlike the class of activities Congress was attempting to regulate in United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 613 (2000) (\"[g]ender-motivated crimes\"), and Lopez, 514 U.S., at 561 (possession of guns near school property), the discharge of fill material into the Nation's waters is almost always undertaken for economic reasons. See V. Albrecht  B. Goode, Wetland Regulation in the Real World, Exh. 3 (Feb. 1994) (demonstrating that the overwhelming majority of acreage for which 404 permits are sought is intended for commercial, industrial, or other economic use).15~    ~    ~      70~      Moreover, no one disputes that the discharge of fill into \"isolated\" waters that serve as migratory bird habitat will, in the aggregate, adversely affect migratory bird populations. See, e.g., 1 Secretary of the Interior, Report to Congress, The Impact of Federal Programs on Wetlands: The Lower Mississippi Alluvial Plain and the Prairie Pothole Region 79_80 (Oct. 1988) (noting that \"isolated,\" phase 3 waters \"are among [the] most important and also the most threatened ecosystems in the United States\" because \"[t]hey are prime nesting grounds for many species of North American waterfowl _\" and provide \"[u]p to 50 percent of the [U.S.] production of migratory waterfowl\"). Nor does petitioner dispute that the particular waters it seeks to fill are home to many important species of migratory birds, including the second-largest breeding colony of Great Blue Herons in northeastern Illinois, App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a, and several species of waterfowl protected by international treaty and Illinois endangered species laws, Brief for Federal Respondents 7.16~    ~    ~      71~      In addition to the intrinsic value of migratory birds, see Missouri v. Holland, 252 U.S. 416, 435 (1920) (noting the importance of migratory birds as \"protectors of our forests and our crops\" and as \"a food supply\"), it is undisputed that literally millions of people regularly participate in birdwatching and hunting and that those activities generate a host of commercial activities of great value.17 The causal connection between the filling of wetlands and the decline of commercial activities associated with migratory birds is not \"attenuated,\" Morrison, 529 U.S., at 612; it is direct and concrete. Cf. Gibbs v. Babbitt, 214 F.3d 483, 492_493 (CA4 2000) (\"The relationship between red wolf takings and interstate commerce is quite direct-with no red wolves, there will be no red wolf related tourism _\").~    ~    ~      72~      Finally, the migratory bird rule does not blur the \"distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local.\" Morrison, 529 U.S., at 617_618. Justice Holmes cogently observed in Missouri v. Holland that the protection of migratory birds is a textbook example of a national problem. 252 U.S., at 435 (\"It is not sufficient to rely upon the States [to protect migratory birds]. The reliance is vain _\"). The destruction of aquatic migratory bird habitat, like so many other environmental problems, is an action in which the benefits (e.g., a new landfill) are disproportionately local, while many of the costs (e.g., fewer migratory birds) are widely dispersed and often borne by citizens living in other States. In such situations, described by economists as involving \"externalities,\" federal regulation is both appropriate and necessary. Revesz, Rehabilitating Interstate Competition: Rethinking the \"Race-to-the-Bottom\" Rationale for Federal Environmental Regulation, 67 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1210, 1222 (1992) (\"The presence of interstate externalities is a powerful reason for intervention at the federal level\"); cf. Hodel, 452 U.S., at 281_282 (deferring to Congress' finding that nationwide standards were \"essential\" in order to avoid \"destructive interstate competition\" that might undermine environmental standards). Identifying the Corps' jurisdiction by reference to waters that serve as habitat for birds that migrate over state lines also satisfies this Court's expressed desire for some \"jurisdictional element\" that limits federal activity to its proper scope. Morrison, 529 U.S., at 612.~    ~    ~      73~      The power to regulate commerce among the several States necessarily and properly includes the power to preserve the natural resources that generate such commerce. Cf. Sporhase v. Nebraska ex rel. Douglas, 458 U.S. 941, 953 (1982) (holding water to be an \"article of commerce\"). Migratory birds, and the waters on which they rely, are such resources. Moreover, the protection of migratory birds is a well-established federal responsibility. As Justice Holmes noted in Missouri v. Holland, the federal interest in protecting these birds is of \"the first magnitude.\" 252 U.S., at 435. Because of their transitory nature, they \"can be protected only by national action.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      74~      Whether it is necessary or appropriate to refuse to allow petitioner to fill those ponds is a question on which we have no voice. Whether the Federal Government has the power to require such permission, however, is a question that is easily answered. If, as it does, the Commerce Clause empowers Congress to regulate particular \"activities causing air or water pollution, or other environmental hazards that may have effects in more than one State,\" Hodel, 452 U.S., at 282, it also empowers Congress to control individual actions that, in the aggregate, would have the same effect. Perez, 402 U.S., at 154; Wickard, 317 U.S., at 127_128.18 There is no merit in petitioner's constitutional argument.~    ~    ~      75~      Because I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, I respectfully dissent.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~          See R.

T. 1984, No. 84_701. The District Court in Riverside Bayview found that there was no direct \"hydrological\" connection between the parcel at issue and any nearby navigable waters. App. to Pet. for Cert. in Riverside Bayview 25a. The wetlands characteristics of the parcel were due, not to a surface or groundwater connection to any actually navigable water, but to \"poor drainage\" resulting from \"the Lamson soil that underlay the property.\" Brief for Respondent in Riverside Bayview 7. Nevertheless, this Court found occasional surface runoff from the property into nearby waters to constitute a meaningful connection. Riverside Bayview, 474 U.S., at 134; Brief for United States in Riverside Bayview 8, n. 7. Of course, the ecological connection between the wetlands and the nearby waters also played a central role in this Court's decision. Riverside Bayview, 474 U.S., at 134_135. Both types of connection are also present in many, and possibly most, \"isolated\" waters. Brief for Dr. Gene Likens et al. as Amici Curiae 6_22. Indeed, although the majority and petitioner both refer to the waters on petitioner's site as \"isolated,\" ante, at 11; Brief for Petitioner 11, their role as habitat for migratory birds, birds that serve important functions in the ecosystems of other waters throughout North America, suggests that-ecologically speaking-the waters at issue in this case are anything but isolated.~      ~      ~        3~          See also Rivers and Harbors Appropriations Act of 1896, 29 Stat. 234; River and Harbor Act of 1894, 28 Stat. 363; River and Harbor Appropriations Act of 1890, 26 Stat. 426; The River and Harbor Appropriations Act of 1886, 24 Stat. 329.~      ~      ~        4~          In 1970, the House Committee on Government Operations followed the Court's lead and advocated the use of 13 as a pollution control provision.

Rev. 503, 512 (1977) (hereinafter Power). The program ended soon after it started, however, when a District Court, reading the language of 13 literally, held the permit program invalid. Ibid.; see Kalur v. Resor, 335 F. Supp. 1, 9 (DC 1971).~      ~      ~        5~          The FWPCA of 1948 applied only to \"interstate waters.\" 10(e), 62 Stat. 1161. Subsequently, it was harmonized with the Rivers and Harbors Act such that-like the earlier statute-the FWPCA defined its jurisdiction with reference to \"navigable waters.\" Pub. L. 89_753, 211, 80 Stat. 1252. None of these early versions of the FWPCA could fairly be described as establishing a comprehensive approach to the problem, but they did contain within themselves several of the elements that would later be employed in the CWA. Milwaukee v. Illinois, 451 U.S. 304, 318, n. 10 (1981) (Rehnquist, J.) (Congress intended to do something \"quite different\" in the 1972 Act); 2 W. Rodgers, Environmental Law: Air and Water 4.1, pp. 10_11 (1986) (describing the early versions of the FWPCA).~      ~      ~        6~          The definition of \"navigable water\" in earlier versions of the FWPCA had made express reference to navigability. 211, 80 Stat. 1253.~      ~      ~        7~          The version adopted by the House of Representatives defined \"navigable waters\" as \"the navigable waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.\" H. R. 11896, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., 502(8) (1971), reprinted in 1 Leg. Hist. 1069. The CWA ultimately defined \"navigable waters\" simply as \"the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.\" 33 U.S.C.  1362(7).~      ~      ~        8~          The Corps later acknowledged that the 1974 regulations \"limited the Section 404 permit program to the same waters that were being regulated under the River and Harbor Act of 1899.\" 42 Fed. Reg. 37123 (1977). Although refusing to defer to the Corps' present interpretation of the statute, ante, at 11_12, the majority strangely attributes some significance to the Corps' initial reluctance to read the 1972 Act as expanding its jurisdiction, ante, at 7 (\"Respondents put forward no persuasive evidence that the Corps mistook Congress' intent in 1974\"). But, stranger still, by construing the statute as extending to nonnavigable tributaries and adjacent wetlands, the majority reads the statute more broadly than the 1974 regulations that it seems willing to accept as a correct construction of the Corps' jurisdiction. As I make clear in the text, there is abundant evidence that the Corps was wrong in 1974 and that the Court is wrong today.~      ~      ~        9~          See, e.g., Natural Resources Defense Council v. Callaway, 392 F. Supp. 685, 686 (DC 1975); United States v. Holland, 373 F. Supp. 665 (MD Fla. 1974).~      ~      ~        10~          In a 1974 letter to the head of the Army Corps of Engineers, the EPA Administrator expressed his disagreement with the Corps' parsimonious view of its own jurisdiction under the CWA. Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972: Hearings before the Senate Committee on Public Works, 94th Cong., 2d Sess., 349 (1976) (letter dated June 19, 1974, from Russell E. Train, Administrator of EPA, to Lt. Gen. W. C. Gribble, Jr., Chief of Corps of Engineers). The EPA is the agency that generally administers the CWA, except as otherwise provided. 33 U.S.C.  1251(d); see also 43 Op. Atty. Gen. 197 (1979) (\"Congress intended to confer upon the administrator of the [EPA] the final administrative authority\" to determine the reach of the term \"navigable waters\").~      ~      ~        11~          The House Committee on Government Operations noted the disagreement between the EPA and the Corps over the meaning of \"navigable waters\" and ultimately expressed its agreement with the EPA's broader reading of the statute. H. R. Rep. No. 93_1396, pp. 23_27 (1974).~      ~      ~        12~          42 Fed. Reg. 37127 (1977), as amended, 33 CFR  328.3(a)(3) (1977). The so-called \"migratory bird\" rule, upon which the Corps based its assertion of jurisdiction in this case, is merely a specific application of the more general jurisdictional definition first adopted in the 1975 and 1977 rules. The \"rule,\" which operates as a rule of thumb for identifying the waters that fall within the Corps' jurisdiction over phase 3 waters, first appeared in the preamble to a 1986 repromulgation of the Corps' definition of \"navigable waters.\" 51 Fed. Reg. 41217 (1986). As the Corps stated in the preamble, this repromulgation was not intended to alter its jurisdiction in any way. Ibid. Instead, the Corps indicated, the migratory bird rule was enacted simply to \"clarif[y]\" the scope of existing jurisdictional regulations. Ibid.~      ~      ~        13~          The majority appears to believe that its position is consistent with Riverside Bayview because of that case's reservation of the question whether the Corps' jurisdiction extends to \"certain wetlands not necessarily adjacent to other waters,\" 474 U.S., at 124, n. 2. But it is clear from the context that the question reserved by Riverside Bayview did not concern \"isolated\" waters, such as those at issue in this case, but rather \"isolated\" wetlands. See id., at 131_132, n. 8 (\"We are not called upon to address the question of the authority of the Corps to regulate discharges of fill material into wetlands that are not adjacent to bodies of open water _\"). Unlike the open waters present on petitioner's site, wetlands are lands \"that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.\" 33 CFR  328.3(b) (2000). If, as I believe, actually navigable waters lie at the very heart of Congress' commerce power and \"isolated,\" nonnavigable waters lie closer to (but well within) the margin, \"isolated wetlands,\" which are themselves only marginally \"waters,\" are the most marginal category of \"waters of the United States\" potentially covered by the statute. It was the question of the extension of federal jurisdiction to that category of \"waters\" that the Riverside Bayview Court reserved. That question is not presented in this case.~      ~      ~        14~          In any event, to attach significance to the Report's statement that the committee amendments do not \"redefine navigable waters,\" one must first accept the majority's erroneous interpretation of the 1972 Act. But the very Report upon which the majority relies states that \"[t]he 1972 [FWPCA] exercised comprehensive jurisdiction over the Nation's waters to control pollution to the fullest constitutional extent.\" S. Rep. No. 95_370, at 75, reprinted in 4 Leg. Hist. of CWA 708 (emphases added). Even if the Court's flawed reading of the earlier statute were correct, however, the language to which the Court points does not counsel against finding congressional acquiescence in the Corps' 1975 regulations. Quite the contrary. From the perspective of the 1977 Congress, those regulations constituted the status quo that the proposed amendments sought to alter. Considering the Report's favorable references to the Corps' \"continu[ing]\" jurisdiction over phase 2 and 3 waters, the language concerning the failure of the amendments to \"redefine navigable waters\" cuts strongly against the majority's position, which instead completely excises phase 3 waters from the scope of the Act. Ibid.~      ~      ~        15~          The fact that petitioner can conceive of some people who may discharge fill for noneconomic reasons does not weaken the legitimacy of the Corps' jurisdictional claims. As we observed in Perez v. United States, 402 U.S. 146 (1971), \"[w]here the class of activities is regulated and that class is within the reach of federal power, the courts have no power to excise, as trivial, individual instances of the class.\" Id., at 154 (internal quotation marks omitted).~      ~      ~        16~          Other bird species using petitioner's site as habitat include the \"Great Egret, Green-backed Heron, Black-crowned Night Heron, Canada Goose, Wood Duck, Mallard, Greater Yellowlegs, Belted Kingfisher, Northern Waterthrush, Louisiana Waterthrush, Swamp Sparrow, and Red-winged Blackbird.\" Brief for Petitioner 4, n. 3.~      ~      ~        17~          In 1984, the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment found that, in 1980, 5.3 million Americans hunted migratory birds, spending $638 million.

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.PAUL L. GLOVER, PETITIONERv.UNITED STATES~    No. 99-8576.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued November 27, 2000~    Decided January 9, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      The probation office recommended that petitioner Glover's federal labor racketeering, money laundering, and tax evasion convictions be grouped under United States Sentencing Guidelines 3D1.2, which allows the grouping of counts involving substantially the same harm. The Government objected to grouping the money laundering counts with the others, and the trial court agreed. Glover's offense level was thus increased by two levels, resulting in an increased sentence of between 6 and 21 months. His counsel did not press the grouping issue in the trial court or raise it on appeal to the Seventh Circuit, which affirmed his conviction and sentence. Glover then filed a pro se motion to correct his sentence, arguing that his counsel's failure to pursue the issue was ineffective assistance, without which his offense level would have been lower. The District Court denied the motion, determining that under Circuit precedent a 6 to 21 month sentencing increase was not significant enough to amount to prejudice for purposes of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668. As a result, the court did not decide whether Glover's counsel fell below a reasonable standard of competence, and denied his ineffective-assistance claim. The Seventh Circuit affirmed, relying on the Government's theory that even were the performance of Glover's counsel ineffective, the resulting increase in sentence, under Circuit precedent, would not constitute prejudice.~      Held: The Seventh Circuit erred in engrafting onto the prejudice branch of the Strickland test the requirement that any increase in sentence must meet a standard of significance. Pp. 4_7.~      (a) The Government no longer asserts that a 6 to 21 month prison term increase is not prejudice under Strickland. The Seventh Circuit drew the substance of its rule from Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.S. 364, 369, which holds that in some circumstances a mere difference in outcome will not suffice to establish prejudice. This Court explained last Term that the Lockhart holding does not supplant the Strickland analysis. See Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 393. The Seventh Circuit was incorrect to rely on Lockhart to deny relief to persons who might show deficient performance in their counsel's failure to object to an error of law affecting the sentencing calculation because the sentence increase does not meet some baseline prejudice standard. This Court's jurisprudence suggests that any amount of actual jail time has Sixth Amendment significance. E.g., Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25. Moreover, decisions on the right to jury trial in a criminal case, see id., at 29, do not control the question whether a showing of prejudice, in the context of an ineffective-assistance claim, requires a significant prison term increase. The Seventh Circuit's rule is not well considered in any event, because there is no obvious dividing line by which to measure how much longer a sentence must be for the increase to constitute substantial prejudice. Although the amount by which a defendant's sentence is increased by a particular decision may be a factor in determining whether counsel's performance in failing to argue the point constitutes ineffective assistance, under a determinate system of constrained discretion such as the Sentencing Guidelines it cannot serve as a bar to a showing of prejudice. Here the Court considers the sentencing calculation itself, which resulted from a ruling that had it been error, would have been correctable on appeal. The question of deficient performance is not before the Court, but it is clear that prejudice flowed from the asserted error in sentencing. Pp. 4_6.~      (b) The Government's various arguments for affirming the Seventh Circuit's judgment were neither raised nor resolved below, and are outside the questions presented by the petition for certiorari. Whether these issues remain open, and if so whether they have merit, are questions for the lower courts to determine in the first instance. Pp. 6_7.~      182 F.3d 921, reversed and remanded.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT~      Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      The issue presented rests upon the initial assumption, which we accept for analytic purposes, that the trial court erred in a Sentencing Guidelines determination after petitioner's conviction of a federal offense. The legal error, petitioner alleges, increased his prison sentence by at least 6 months and perhaps by 21 months. We must decide whether this would be \"prejudice\" under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). The Government is not ready to concede error in the sentencing determination but now acknowledges that if an increased prison term did flow from an error the petitioner has established Strickland prejudice. In agreement with the Government and petitioner on this point, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.~    ~    ~      2~      * In the 1980's and early 1990's, petitioner Paul Glover was the Vice President and General Counsel of the Chicago Truck Drivers, Helpers, and Warehouse Workers Union (Independent). The evidence showed Glover used his control over the union's investments to enrich himself and his co-conspirators through kickbacks. When the malfeasance was discovered, he was tried in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. His first trial ended when the jury could not agree, but a second jury convicted him. The presentence investigation report prepared by the probation office recommended that the convictions for labor racketeering, money laundering, and tax evasion be grouped together under United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual 3D1.2 (Nov. 1994), which allows the grouping of \"counts involving substantially the same harm.\" The Government, insisting that the money laundering counts could not be grouped with the other counts, objected to that recommendation, and the District Court held a hearing on the matter. The money laundering counts, it ruled, should not be grouped with Glover's other offenses. The ruling, as the trial court viewed it, was in conformance with decisions in those Courts of Appeals which had refused to group money laundering counts with other counts for various reasons. See, e.g., United States v. Lombardi, 5 F.3d 568 (CA1 1993); United States v. Porter, 909 F.2d 789 (CA4 1990); United States v. Taylor, 984 F.2d 298 (CA9 1993); United States v. Johnson, 971 F.2d 562 (CA10 1992); United States v. Harper, 972 F.2d 321 (CA11 1992). In the trial court, Glover's attorneys did not submit papers or offer extensive oral arguments contesting the no-grouping argument advanced by the Government. When the District Court decided not to group the money laundering counts with the other counts, Glover's offense level was increased by two levels, yielding a concomitant increase in the sentencing range. Glover was sentenced to 84 months in prison, which was in the middle of the Guidelines range of 78 to 97 months.~    ~    ~      3~      On appeal to the Seventh Circuit, Glover's counsel (the same attorneys who represented him in District Court) did not raise the grouping issue; instead, they concentrated on claims that certain testimony from his first trial should not have been admitted at his second trial and that he should not have been assessed a two-level increase for perjury at his first trial. A short time after argument on Glover's appeal, a different panel of the Seventh Circuit held that, under some circumstances, grouping of money laundering offenses with other counts was proper under 3D1.2. United States v. Wilson, 98 F.3d 281 (1996). A month and a half later, the Seventh Circuit rejected both of Glover's arguments and affirmed his conviction and sentence. 101 F.3d 1183 (1996).~    ~    ~      4~      Glover filed a pro se motion to correct his sentence under 28 U.S.C.  2255 (1994 ed. and Supp. III). The failure of his counsel to press the grouping issue, he argued, was ineffective assistance, a position confirmed, in his view, by the Court of Appeals' decision in Wilson. The performance of counsel, he contended, fell below a reasonable standard both at sentencing, when his attorneys did not with any clarity or force contest the Government's argument, and on appeal, when they did not present the issue in their briefs or call the Wilson decision to the panel's attention following the oral argument. He further argued that absent the ineffective assistance, his offense level would have been two levels lower, yielding a Guidelines sentencing range of 63 to 78 months. Under this theory, the 84-month sentence he received was an unlawful increase of anywhere between 6 and 21 months.~    ~    ~      5~      The District Court denied Glover's motion, determining that under Seventh Circuit precedent an increase of 6 to 21 months in a defendant's sentence was not significant enough to amount to prejudice for purposes of Strickland v. Washington, supra. As a result, the District Court did not decide the issue whether the performance of Glover's counsel fell below a reasonable standard of competence. On appeal to the Seventh Circuit, the Government argued only that Glover had not suffered prejudice within the meaning of Strickland. See App. to Reply Brief for Petitioner 1a_22a. Citing Durrive v. United States, 4 F.3d 548 (CA7 1993), the Government contended that even were the performance of Glover's counsel ineffective, the resulting additional 6 to 21 months, under the law as established in the Seventh Circuit, would not constitute prejudice. App. to Reply Brief for Petitioner 21a. The Court of Appeals affirmed, relying on that theory. 182 F.3d 921 (1999) (table). We granted Glover's petition for certiorari. 530 U.S. ____ (2000).~    ~    II~    ~      6~      The Government no longer puts forth the proposition that a 6 to 21 month prison term increase is not prejudice under Strickland. It now acknowledges that such a rule, without more, would be \"inconsistent with this Court's cases and unworkable.\" Brief for United States 18.~    ~    ~      7~      It appears the Seventh Circuit drew the substance of its no-prejudice rule from our opinion in Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.S. 364 (1993). Lockhart holds that in some circumstances a mere difference in outcome will not suffice to establish prejudice. Id., at 369. The Seventh Circuit extracted from this holding the rule at issue here, which denies relief when the increase in sentence is said to be not so significant as to render the outcome of sentencing unreliable or fundamentally unfair. See Durrive, supra, at 550_551. The Court explained last Term that our holding in Lockhart does not supplant the Strickland analysis. See Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 393 (2000) (\"Cases such as Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U.S. 157 (1986), and Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.S. 364 (1993), do not justify a departure from a straightforward application of Strickland when the ineffectiveness of counsel does deprive the defendant of a substantive or procedural right to which the law entitles him\"); id., at 414 (opinion of O'Connor, J.) (\"As I explained in my concurring opinion in [Lockhart], `in the vast majority of cases . . . [t]he determinative question-whether there is \"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different\"-remains unchanged' \"). The Seventh Circuit was incorrect to rely on Lockhart to deny relief to persons attacking their sentence who might show deficient performance in counsel's failure to object to an error of law affecting the calculation of a sentence because the sentence increase does not meet some baseline standard of prejudice. Authority does not suggest that a minimal amount of additional time in prison cannot constitute prejudice. Quite to the contrary, our jurisprudence suggests that any amount of actual jail time has Sixth Amendment significance. Compare Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25 (1972) (holding that the assistance of counsel must be provided when a defendant is tried for a crime that results in a sentence of imprisonment), with Scott v. Illinois, 440 U.S. 367 (1979) (holding that a criminal defendant has no Sixth Amendment right to counsel when his trial does not result in a sentence of imprisonment). Our decisions on the right to jury trial in a criminal case do not suggest that there is no prejudice in the circumstances here. Those cases have limited the right to jury trial to offenses where the potential punishment was imprisonment for six months or more. See Argersinger, supra, at 29 (citing Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145 (1968)). But they do not control the question whether a showing of prejudice, in the context of a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, requires a significant increase in a term of imprisonment.~    ~    ~      8~      The Seventh Circuit's rule is not well considered in any event, because there is no obvious dividing line by which to measure how much longer a sentence must be for the increase to constitute substantial prejudice. Indeed, it is not even clear if the relevant increase is to be measured in absolute terms or by some fraction of the total authorized sentence. See Martin v. United States, 109 F.3d 1177, 1183 (CA7 1996) (Rovner, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). Although the amount by which a defendant's sentence is increased by a particular decision may be a factor to consider in determining whether counsel's performance in failing to argue the point constitutes ineffective assistance, under a determinate system of constrained discretion such as the Sentencing Guidelines it cannot serve as a bar to a showing of prejudice. Compare Spriggs v. Collins, 993 F.2d 85, 88 (CA5 1993) (requiring a showing that a sentence would have been \"significantly less harsh\" under the Texas discretionary sentencing scheme), with United States v. Phillips, 210 F.3d 345 (CA5 2000) (finding prejudice under the Sentencing Guidelines when an error by counsel led to an increased sentence). We hold that the Seventh Circuit erred in engrafting this additional requirement onto the prejudice branch of the Strickland test. This is not a case where trial strategies, in retrospect, might be criticized for leading to a harsher sentence. Here we consider the sentencing calculation itself, a calculation resulting from a ruling which, if it had been error, would have been correctable on appeal. We express no opinion on the ultimate merits of Glover's claim because the question of deficient performance is not before us, but it is clear that prejudice flowed from the asserted error in sentencing.~    ~    III~    ~      9~      The Government makes various arguments for alternative grounds to affirm the Court of Appeals. Among other contentions, the Government suggests that the failure of Glover's counsel to argue for grouping of the money laundering counts was not deficient; that Glover's grouping claim has no legal merit in any event; and that even if Glover had prevailed on his grouping claim, his sentence in fact would have increased as a result. Glover disputes these contentions. We need not describe the arguments in great detail, because despite the fact the parties have joined issue at least in part on these points, they were neither raised in nor passed upon by the Court of Appeals. In the ordinary course we do not decide questions neither raised nor resolved below. See Taylor v. Freeland  Kronz, 503 U.S. 638, 646 (1992). As a general rule, furthermore, we do not decide issues outside the questions presented by the petition for certiorari. This Court's Rule 14.1(a). Whether these issues remain open, and if so whether they have merit, are questions for the Court of Appeals or the District Court to consider and determine in the first instance.~    ~    ~      10~      The judgment of the Seventh Circuit is reversed. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      11~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ",

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.DAVID A. GITLITZ, et ux., et al., PETITIONERSv.COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE~    No. 99-1295.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued October 2, 2000~    Decided January 9, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      Shareholders of a corporation taxed under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code may elect a \"pass-through\" taxation system, under which the corporation's profits pass through directly to its shareholders on a pro rata basis and are reported on the shareholders' individual tax returns. 26 U.S.C.  1366(a)(1)(A). To prevent double taxation of distributed income, shareholders may increase their corporate bases by certain items of income. 1367(a)(1)(A). Corporate losses and deductions are passed through in a similar manner, 1366(a)(1)(A), and the shareholders' bases in the S corporation's stock and debt are decreased accordingly, 1367(a)(2)(B), 1367(b)(2)(A). However, to the extent that such losses and deductions exceed a shareholder's basis in the S corporation's stock and debt, the excess is \"suspended\" until that basis becomes large enough to permit the deduction. 1366(d)(1)_(2). In 1991, an insolvent S corporation in which petitioners David Gitlitz and Philip Winn were shareholders excluded its entire discharge of indebtedness amount from gross income. On their tax returns, petitioners used their pro rata share of the discharge amount to increase their bases in the corporation's stock on the theory that it was an \"item of income\" subject to pass-through. They used their increased bases to deduct corporate losses and deductions, including suspended ones from previous years. With the upward basis adjustments, they were each able to deduct the full amount of their pro rata share of the corporation's losses. The Commissioner determined that they could not use the corporation's discharge of indebtedness to increase their bases in the stock and denied their loss deductions. The Tax Court ultimately agreed. In affirming, the Tenth Circuit assumed that excluded discharge of indebtedness is an item of income subject to pass-through, but held that the discharge amount first had to be used to reduce certain tax attributes of the S corporation under 108(b) and that only the leftover amount could be used to increase basis. Because the tax attribute to be reduced here (the corporation's net operating loss) equaled the discharged debt amount, that entire amount was absorbed by the reduction at the corporate level and nothing remained to be passed through to the shareholders.~      Held:~      1. The statute's plain language establishes that excluded discharged debt is an \"item of income,\" which passes through to shareholders and increases their bases in an S corporation's stock. Section 61(a)(12) states that discharge of indebtedness is included in gross income. And 108(a) provides only that the discharge ceases to be included in gross income when the S corporation is insolvent, not that it ceases to be an item of income, as the Commissioner contends. Not all items of income are included in gross income, see 1366(a)(1), so an item's mere exclusion from gross income does not imply that the amount ceases to be an item of income. Moreover, 101 through 136 employ the same construction to exclude various items from gross income, but not even the Commissioner encourages a reading that would exempt all such items from pass-through. Instead the Commissioner asserts that discharge of indebtedness is unique because it requires no economic outlay on the taxpayer's part, but can identify no statutory language that makes this distinction relevant. On the contrary, the statute makes clear that 108(a)'s exclusion does not alter the character of discharge of indebtedness as an item of income. Specifically, 108(e) presumes that such discharge is always \"income,\" and that the only question for 108 purposes is whether it is includible in gross income. The Commissioner's contentions that, notwithstanding the statute's plain language, excluded discharge of indebtedness is not income and, specifically, that it is not \"tax-exempt income\" under 1366(a)(1)(A) do not alter the conclusion reached here. Pp. 5_9.~      2. Pass-through is performed before the reduction of an S corporation's tax attributes under 108(b). The sequencing question presented here is important. If attribute reduction is performed before the discharge of indebtedness is passed through to the shareholders, the shareholders' losses that exceed basis are treated as the corporation's net operating loss and are then reduced by the amount of the discharged debt; in this case no suspended losses would remain that would permit petitioners to take deductions. However, if it is performed after the discharged debt income is passed through, then the shareholders would be able to deduct their losses (up to the amount of the increase in basis caused by the discharged debt). Any suspended losses remaining then will be treated as the S corporation's net operating loss and reduced by the discharged debt amount. Section 108(b)(4)(A) expressly addresses the sequencing question, directing that the attribute reductions \"shall be made after the determination of the tax imposed _ for the taxable year of the discharge.\" (Emphases added.) In order to determine the \"tax imposed,\" a shareholder must adjust his basis in S corporation stock and pass through all items of income and loss. Consequently the attribute reduction must be made after the basis adjustment and pass-through. Petitioners must pass through the discharged debt, increase corporate bases, and then deduct their losses, all before any attribute reduction could occur. Because their basis increase is equal to their losses, they have no suspended losses remaining and thus have no net operating losses to reduce. The primary arguments made in Courts of Appeals against this reading of the sequencing provision are rejected. Pp. 9_13.~      182 F.3d 1143, reversed.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT~      Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and Stevens, O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, and Ginsburg, JJ., joined. Breyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      The Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed tax deficiencies against petitioners David and Louise Gitlitz and Philip and Eleanor Winn because they used nontaxed discharge of indebtedness to increase their bases in S corporation stock and to deduct suspended losses. In this case we must answer two questions. First, we must decide whether the Internal Revenue Code (Code) permits taxpayers to increase bases in their S corporation stock by the amount of an S corporation's discharge of indebtedness excluded from gross income. And, second, if the Code permits such an increase, we must decide whether the increase occurs before or after taxpayers are required to reduce the S corporation's tax attributes.~    ~    ~      2~      * David Gitlitz and Philip Winn1 were shareholders of P. D. W.  A., Inc., a corporation that had elected to be taxed under subchapter S of the Code, 26 U.S.C.  13611379 (1994 ed. and Supp. III). Subchapter S allows shareholders of qualified corporations to elect a \"pass-through\" taxation system under which income is subjected to only one level of taxation. See Bufferd v. Commissioner, 506 U.S. 523, 525 (1993). The corporation's profits pass through directly to its shareholders on a pro rata basis and are reported on the shareholders' individual tax returns. See 1366(a)(1)(A).2 To prevent double taxation of income upon distribution from the cor-poration to the shareholders, 1367(a)(1)(A) permits shareholders to increase their corporate bases by items of income identified in 1366(a) (1994 ed. and Supp. III). Corporate losses and deductions are passed through in a similar manner, see 1366(a)(1)(A), and the shareholders' bases in the S corporation's stock and debt are decreased accordingly, see 1367(a)(2)(B), 1367(b)(2)(A). However, a shareholder cannot take corporate losses and deductions into account on his personal tax return to the extent that such items exceed his basis in the stock and debt of the S corporation. See 1366(d)(1) (Supp. III). If those items exceed the basis, the excess is \"suspended\" until the shareholder's basis becomes large enough to permit the deduction. See 1366(d)(1)(2) (1994 ed. and Supp. III).~    ~    ~      3~      In 1991, P. D. W.  A. realized $2,021,296 of discharged indebtedness. At the time, the corporation was insolvent in the amount of $2,181,748. Because it was insolvent even after the discharge of indebtedness was added to its balance sheet, P. D. W.  A. excluded the entire discharge of indebtedness amount from gross income under 26 U.S.C.  108(a) and 108(d)(7)(A). On their tax returns, Gitlitz and Winn increased their bases in P. D. W.  A. stock by their pro rata share (50 percent each) of the amount of the corporation's discharge of indebtedness. Petitioners' theory was that the discharge of indebtedness was an \"item of income\" subject to pass-through under 1366(a)(1)(A). They used their increased bases to deduct on their personal tax returns corporate losses and deductions, including losses and deductions from previous years that had been suspended under 1366(d). Gitlitz and Winn each had losses (including suspended losses and operating losses) that totaled $1,010,648. With the upward basis adjustments of $1,010,648 each, Gitlitz and Winn were each able to deduct the full amount of their pro rata share of P. D. W.  A.'s losses.~    ~    ~      4~      The Commissioner determined that petitioners could not use P. D. W.  A.'s discharge of indebtedness to increase their bases in the stock and denied petitioners' loss deductions. Petitioners petitioned the Tax Court to review the deficiency determinations. The Tax Court, in its initial opinion, granted relief to petitioners and held that the discharge of indebtedness was an \"item of income\" and therefore could support a basis increase. See Winn v. Commissioner, 73 TCM 3167 (1997), 97,286 RIA Memo withdrawn and reissued, 75 TCM 1840 (1998), 98,071 RIA Memo TC. In light of the Tax Court's decision in Nelson v. Commissioner, 110 T. C. 114 (1998), aff'd, 182 F.3d 1152 (CA10 1999),3 however, the Tax Court granted the Commissioner's motion for reconsideration and held that shareholders may not use an S corporation's untaxed discharge of indebtedness to increase their bases in corporate stock. See Winn v. Commissioner, 75 TCM 1840 (1998), 98,071 RIA Memo TC.~    ~    ~      5~      The Court of Appeals affirmed. See 182 F.3d 1143 (CA10 1999). It assumed that excluded discharge of indebtedness is an item of income subject to passthrough to shareholders pursuant to 1366(a)(1)(A), id., at 1148, 1151, n. 7, but held that the discharge of indebtedness amount first had to be used to reduce certain tax attributes of the S corporation under 108(b), and that only the leftover amount could be used to increase basis.4 The Court of Appeals explained that, because the tax attribute to be reduced (in this case the corporation's net operating loss) was equal to the amount of discharged debt, the entire amount of discharged debt was absorbed by the reduction at the corporate level, and nothing remained of the discharge of indebtedness to be passed through to the shareholders under 1366(a)(1)(A). Id., at 1151. Because Courts of Appeals have disagreed on how to treat discharge of indebtedness of an insolvent S corporation, compare Gaudiano v. Commissioner, 216 F.3d 524, 535 (CA6 2000) (holding that tax attributes are reduced before excluded discharged debt income is passed through to shareholders), cert. pending, No. 00_459, Witzel v. Commissioner, 200 F.3d 496, 498 (CA7 2000) (same), cert. pending, No. 99_1693, and 182 F.3d, at 1150 (case below), with United States v. Farley, 202 F.3d 198, 206 (CA3 2000) (holding that excluded discharged debt income is passed through to shareholders before tax attributes are reduced), cert. pending, No. 99_1675; see also Pugh v. Commissioner, 213 F.3d 1324, 1330 (CA11 2000) (holding that excluded discharged debt income is subject to pass-through and can increase basis), cert. pending, No. 00_242, we granted certiorari. 529 U.S. 1097 (2000).~    ~    II~    ~      6~      Before we can reach the issue addressed by the Court of Appeals-whether the increase in the taxpayers' corporate bases occurs before or after the taxpayers are required to reduce the S corporation's tax attributes-we must address the argument raised by the Commissioner.5 The Commissioner argues that the discharge of indebtedness of an insolvent S corporation is not an \"item of income\" and thus never passes through to shareholders. Under a plain reading of the statute, we reject this argument and conclude that excluded discharged debt is indeed an \"item of income,\" which passes through to the shareholders and increases their bases in the stock of the S corporation.~    ~    ~      7~      Section 61(a)(12) states that discharge of indebtedness generally is included in gross income. Section 108(a)(1) provides an express exception to this general rule:~    ~    ~      8~      \"Gross income does not include any amount which (but for this subsection) would be includible in gross income by reason of the discharge _ of indebtedness of the taxpayer if-~    ~    ~      9~      .   .   .   .   .~    ~    ~      10~      \"(B) the discharge occurs when the taxpayer is insolvent.\"~    ~    ~      11~      The Commissioner contends that this exclusion from gross income alters the character of the discharge of indebtedness so that it is no longer an \"item of income.\" However, the text and structure of the statute do not support the Commissioner's theory. Section 108(a) simply does not say that discharge of indebtedness ceases to be an item of income when the S corporation is insolvent. Instead it provides only that discharge of indebtedness ceases to be included in gross income. Not all items of income are included in gross income, see 1366(a)(1) (providing that \"items of income,\" including \"tax-exempt\" income, are passed through to shareholders), so mere exclusion of an amount from gross income does not imply that the amount ceases to be an item of income. Moreover, 101 through 136 employ the same construction to exclude various items from gross income: \"Gross income does not include _ .\" The consequence of reading this language in the manner suggested by the Commissioner would be to exempt all items in these sections from pass-through under 1366. However, not even the Commissioner encourages us to reach this sweeping conclusion. Instead the Commissioner asserts that discharge of indebtedness is unique among the types of items excluded from gross income because no economic outlay is required of the taxpayer receiving discharge of indebtedness. But the Commissioner is unable to identify language in the statute that makes this distinction relevant, and we certainly find none.~    ~    ~      12~      On the contrary, the statute makes clear that 108(a)'s exclusion does not alter the character of discharge of indebtedness as an item of income. Specifically, 108(e)(1) reads:~    ~    ~      13~      \"Except as otherwise provided in this section, there shall be no insolvency exception from the general rule that gross income includes income from the discharge of indebtedness.\"~    ~    ~      14~      This provision presumes that discharge of indebtedness is always \"income,\" and that the only question for purposes of 108 is whether it is includible in gross income. If discharge of indebtedness of insolvent entities were not actually \"income,\" there would be no need to provide an exception to its inclusion in gross income; quite simply, if discharge of indebtedness of an insolvent entity were not \"income,\" it would necessarily not be included in gross income.~    ~    ~      15~      Notwithstanding the plain language of the statute, the Commissioner argues, generally, that excluded discharge of indebtedness is not income and, specifically, that it is not \"tax-exempt income\" under 1366(a)(1)(A).6 First, the Commissioner argues that 108 merely codified the \"judicial insolvency exception,\" and that, under this exception, discharge of indebtedness of an insolvent taxpayer was not considered income. The insolvency exception was a rule that the discharge of indebtedness of an insolvent taxpayer was not taxable income. See, e.g., Dallas Transfer  Terminal Warehouse Co. v. Commissioner, 70 F.2d 95 (CA5 1934); Astoria Marine Construction Co. v. Commissioner, 12 T. C. 798 (1949). But the exception has since been limited by 108(e). Section 108(e) precludes us from relying on any understanding of the judicial insolvency exception that was not codified in 108. And as explained above, the language and logic of 108 clearly establish that, although discharge of indebtedness of an insolvent taxpayer is not included in gross income, it is nevertheless income.~    ~    ~      16~      The Commissioner also relies on a Treasury Regulation to support his theory that no income is realized from the discharge of the debt of an insolvent:~    ~    ~      17~      \"Proceedings under Bankruptcy Act.~    ~    ~      18~      \"(1) Income is not realized by a taxpayer by virtue of the discharge, under section 14 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. 32), of his indebtedness as the result of an adjudication in bankruptcy, or by virtue of an agreement among his creditors not consummated under any provision of the Bankruptcy Act, if immediately thereafter the taxpayer's liabilities exceed the value of his assets.\" 26 CFR  1.61_12(b) (2000).~    ~    ~      19~      Even if this regulation could be read (countertextually) to apply outside the bankruptcy context, it merely states that \"[i]ncome is not realized.\" The regulation says nothing about whether discharge of indebtedness is income subject to pass-through under 1366.~    ~    ~      20~      Second, the Commissioner argues that excluded discharge of indebtedness is not \"tax-exempt\" income under 1366(a)(1)(A), but rather \"tax-deferred\" income. According to the Commissioner, because the taxpayer is required to reduce tax attributes that could have provided future tax benefits, the taxpayer will pay taxes on future income that otherwise would have been absorbed by the forfeited tax attributes. Implicit in the Commissioner's labeling of such income as \"tax-deferred,\" however, is the erroneous assumption that 1366(a)(1)(A) does not include \"tax-deferred\" income. Section 1366 applies to \"items of income.\" This section expressly includes \"tax-exempt\" income, but this inclusion does not mean that the statute must therefore exclude \"tax-deferred\" income. The section is worded broadly enough to include any item of income, even tax-deferred income, that \"could affect the liability for tax of any shareholder.\" 1366(a)(1)(A). Thus, none of the Commissioner's contentions alters our conclusion that discharge of indebtedness of an insolvent S corporation is an item of income for purposes of 1366(a)(1)(A).~    ~    III~    ~      21~      Having concluded that excluded discharge of indebtedness is an \"item of income\" and is therefore subject to pass-through to shareholders under 1366, we must resolve the sequencing question addressed by the Court of Appeals-whether pass-through is performed before or after the reduction of the S corporation's tax attributes under 108(b). Section 108(b)(1) provides that \"[t]he amount excluded from gross income under [108(a)] shall be applied to reduce the tax attributes of the taxpayer as provided [in this section].\" Section 108(b)(2) then lists the various tax attributes to be reduced in the order of reduction. The first tax attribute to be reduced, and the one at issue in this case, is the net operating loss. See 108(b)(2)(A). Section 108(d)(7)(B) specifies that, for purposes of attribute reduction, the shareholders' suspended losses for the taxable year of discharge are to be treated as the S corporation's net operating loss. If tax attribute reduction is performed before the discharge of indebtedness is passed through to the shareholders (as the Court of Appeals held), the shareholders' losses that exceed basis are treated as the corporation's net operating loss and are then reduced by the amount of the discharged debt. In this case, no suspended losses would remain that would permit petitioners to take deductions.7 If, however, attribute reduction is performed after the discharged debt income is passed through (as petitioners argue), then the shareholders would be able to deduct their losses (up to the amount of the increase in basis caused by the discharged debt). Any suspended losses remaining then will be treated as the S corporation's net operating loss and will be reduced by the amount of the discharged debt. Therefore, the sequence of the steps of pass-through and attribute reduction determines whether petitioners here were deficient when they increased their bases by the discharged debt amount and deducted their losses.~    ~    ~      22~      The sequencing question is expressly addressed in the statute. Section 108(b)(4)(A) directs that the attribute reductions \"shall be made after the determination of the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year of the discharge.\" (Emphases added.) See also 1017(a) (applying the same sequencing when 108 attribute reduction affects basis of corporate property). In order to determine the \"tax imposed,\" an S corporation shareholder must adjust his basis in his corporate stock and pass through all items of income and loss. See 1366, 1367 (1994 ed. and Supp III). Consequently, the attribute reduction must be made after the basis adjustment and pass-through. In the case of petitioners, they must pass through the discharged debt, increase corporate bases, and then deduct their losses, all before any attribute reduction could occur. Because their basis increase is equal to their losses, petitioners have no suspended losses remaining. They, therefore, have no net operating losses to reduce.~    ~    ~      23~      Although the Commissioner has now abandoned the reasoning of the Court of Appeals below,8 we address the primary arguments made in the Courts of Appeals against petitioners' reading of the sequencing provision. First, one court has expressed the concern that, if the discharge of indebtedness is passed through to the shareholder before the tax attributes are reduced, then there can never be any discharge of indebtedness remaining \"at [the] corporate level,\" 108(d)(7)(A), by which to reduce tax attributes.9 Gaudiano, 216 F.3d, at 533. This concern presumes that tax attributes can be reduced only if the discharge of indebtedness itself remains at the corporate level. The statute, however, does not impose this restriction. Section 108(b)(1) requires only that the tax attributes be reduced by \"[t]he amount excluded from gross income,\" (emphasis added), and that amount is not altered by the mere pass-through of the income to the shareholder.~    ~    ~      24~      Second, courts have discussed the policy concern that, if shareholders were permitted to pass through the discharge of indebtedness before reducing any tax attributes, the shareholders would wrongly experience a \"double windfall\": They would be exempted from paying taxes on the full amount of the discharge of indebtedness, and they would be able to increase basis and deduct their previously suspended losses. See, e.g., 182 F.3d, at 1147_1148. Because the Code's plain text permits the taxpayers here to receive these benefits, we need not address this policy concern.10~    ~    ~      25~      * * *~    ~    ~      26~      The judgment of the Court of Appeals, accordingly, is reversed.~    ~    ~      27~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~          Each man filed a joint tax return with his wife.~      ~      ~        2~           Section 1366(a)(1) provides: \"In determining the tax under this chapter of a shareholder for the shareholder's taxable year in which the taxable year of the S corporation ends _ , there shall be taken into account the shareholder's pro rata share of the corporation's-     \"(A) items of income (including tax-exempt income), loss, deduction, or credit the separate treatment of which could affect the liability for tax of any shareholder . . . .\"~      ~      ~        3~          In Nelson, the Tax Court held that excluded discharge of indebtedness does not pass through to an S corporation's shareholders because 108 is an exception to normal S corporation pass-through rules. Specifically, the court held that, because 108(d)(7)(A) requires that \"subsections (a) [and (b) of 108] shall be applied at the corporate level\" in the case of an S corporation, it precludes any pass-through of the discharge of indebtedness to the shareholder level. See Nelson, 110 T. C., at 121124.~      ~      ~        4~          Section 108(b)(1) reads: \"The amount excluded from gross income under [section 108(a)(1)] shall be applied to reduce the tax attributes of the taxpayer _ .\"~      ~      ~        5~          The Commissioner has altered his arguments throughout the course of this litigation. According to the Tax Court, during the first iteration of this case the Commissioner made several arguments but then settled on a \"final\" one-that the discharge of indebtedness of the insolvent S corporation was not an \"item of income,\" see 73 TCM 3167 (1997), 97,286 RIA Memo TC. In the Court of Appeals, the Commissioner argued instead that, because any pass-through of excluded discharge of indebtedness to petitioners took place after any reduction of tax attributes and by then the income would have been fully absorbed by the tax attributes, no discharged debt remained to flow through to petitioners. The Commissioner relegated to a footnote his argument that discharge of indebtedness is not an \"item of income.\" See Brief for Appellee in Nos. 98_9009 and 98_9010 (CA10), p. 33, n. 14.~      ~      ~        6~          The Commissioner also contends, as does the dissent, that because 108(d)(7)(A) mandates that the discharged debt amount be determined and applied to reduce tax attributes \"at the corporate level,\" rather than at the shareholder level, the discharged debt, even if it is some type of income, simply cannot pass through to shareholders. In other words, the Commissioner contends that 108(d)(7)(A) excepts excluded discharged debt from the general pass-through provisions for S corporations. However, 108(d)(7)(A) merely directs that the exclusion from gross income and the tax attribute reduction be made at the corporate level. Section 108(d)(7)(A) does not state or imply that the debt discharge provisions shall apply only \"at the corporate level.\" The very purpose of Subchapter S is to tax at the shareholder level, not the corporate level. Income is determined at the S corporation level, see 1363(b), not in order to tax the corporation, see 1363(a) (exempting an S corporation from income tax), but solely to pass through to the S corporation's shareholders the corporation's income. Thus, the controlling provision states that, in determining a shareholder's liability, \"there shall be taken into account the shareholder's pro rata share of the corporation's . . . items of income (including tax-exempt income) . . . .\" 1366(a)(1). Nothing in 108(d)(7)(A) suspends the operation of these ordinary pass-through rules.~      ~      ~        7~          Under this scenario, the shareholders' losses would be reduced by the discharge of indebtedness. However, it is unclear precisely what would happen to the discharge of indebtedness. The Court of Appeals below stated that the discharged debt would be \"absorbed\" by the reduction to the extent of the net operating loss and that therefore only the excess excluded discharged debt would remain to pass through to the shareholders. 182 F.3d, at 1149. In contrast, another Court of Appeals suggested, albeit in dictum, that the full amount of the discharge might still pass through to the shareholder and be used to increase basis; the discharged debt amount would reduce the net operating loss but would not be absorbed by it. Witzel v. Commissioner, 200 F.3d 496, 498 (CA7 2000). We need not resolve this issue because we conclude that the discharge of indebtedness passes through before any attribute reduction takes place.~      ~      ~        8~          The Commissioner has abandoned his argument related to the sequencing issue before this Court. This abandonment is particularly odd given that the sequencing issue predominated in the Commissioner's argument to the Court of Appeals. Notwithstanding the Commissioner's attempt at oral argument to distance himself from the reasoning of the Court of Appeals on this issue-the Commissioner represented to us that the Court of Appeals developed its reading of the statute sua sponte, Tr. of Oral Arg. 22_24, 27-it is apparent from the Commissioner's brief in the Court of Appeals that the Commissioner supplied the very sequencing theory that the Court of Appeals adopted. Compare, e.g., Brief for Appellee in Nos. 98_9009 and 98_9010 (CA10), p. 28 (\"First, the discharge of indebtedness income that is excluded under Section 108(a) at the corporate level is temporarily set aside and has no tax consequences _ . Second, PDW  A. computes its tax attributes, i.e., taxpayers' suspended losses. Third, the excluded discharge of indebtness income is applied against and eliminates the suspended losses. Because the excluded income is applied against-and offset by-the suspended losses, no item of income flows through to taxpayers under Section 1366(a), and no upward basis adjustment is made under Section 1367(a)\" (citations omitted)), with, e.g., 182 F.3d, at 1151 (\"PDW  A first must compute its discharge of indebtedness income and set this figure aside temporarily. The corporation then must calculate its net operating loss tax attribute _ . Finally, the corporation must apply the excluded discharged debt to reduce its tax attributes. In this case, the net operating loss tax attribute fully absorbs the corporation's excluded discharge of indebtedness income. Thus, there are no items of income to pass through to Gitlitz and Winn\").~      ~      ~        9~          Similar to this argument is the contention that, in cases such as this one in which the shareholders' suspended losses are fully deducted before attribute reduction could take place, no net operating loss remains and no attribute reduction can occur, thus rendering 108(b) inoperative. However, there will be other cases in which 108(b) will be inoperative. In particular, if a taxpayer has no tax attributes at all, there will be no reduction. Certainly the statute does not condition the exclusion under 108(a) on the ability of the taxpayer to reduce attributes under 108(b). Likewise, in the case of shareholders similarly situated to petitioners in this case, there is also the possibility that other attributes, see 108(b)(2)(B)(G), could be reduced.~      ~      ~        10~          The benefit at issue in this case arises in part because 108(d)(7)(A) permits the exclusion of discharge of indebtedness income from gross income for an insolvent S corporation even when the S corporation shareholder is personally solvent. We are aware of no other instance in which 108 directly benefits a solvent entity. However, the result is required by statute. Between 1982 and 1984, 108 provided that the exclusion from gross income and the reduction in tax attributes occurred at the shareholder level. See Subchapter S Revision Act of 1982, Pub. L. No. 97_354, 3(e), 96 Stat. 1689. This provision, which paralleled the current taxation of partnerships at the partner level, see 26 U.S.C.  108(d)(6), prevented solvent shareholders from benefiting as a result of their S corporation's insolvency. In 1984, however, Congress amended the Code to provide that 108 be applied \"at the corporate level.\" Tax Reform Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98_369, 721(b), 98 Stat. 966. It is as a direct result of this amendment that the solvent petitioners in this case are able to benefit from 108's exclusion.~      ~    ~    ~      28~      Justice Breyer, dissenting.~    ~    ~      29~      I agree with the majority's reasoning with the exception of footnotes 6 and 10. The basic statutory provision before us is 26 U.S.C.  108-the provision that excludes from the \"gross income\" of any \"insolvent\" taxpayer, income that cancellation of a debt (COD) would otherwise generate. As the majority acknowledges, however, ante, at 7, n. 6, 108 contains a subsection that sets forth a special exception. The exception, entitled \"Special rules for S corporation,\" says:~    ~    ~      30~      \"(A) Certain provisions to be applied at corporate level.~    ~    ~      31~      \"In the case of an S corporation, subsections (a), (b), (c), and (g) shall be applied at the corporate level.\" 26 U.S.C.  108(d)(7)(A).~    ~    ~      32~      If one reads this language literally as exclusive, both the COD exclusion (108(a)) and the tax attribute reduction (108(b)) would apply only \"at the corporate level.\" Hence the COD income would not flow through to S corporation shareholders. Consequently, the insolvent S corporation's COD income would not increase the shareholder's basis and would not help the shareholder take otherwise unavailable deductions for suspended losses.~    ~    ~      33~      The Commissioner argues that we should read the language in this way as preventing the flow-through of the corporation's COD income. Brief for United States 27. He points to the language of a House Committee, which apparently thought, when Congress passed an amendment to 108, that the Commissioner's reading is correct. H. R. Rep. No. 103_111, pp. 624_625 (1993) (\"[T]he exclusion and basis reduction are both made at the S corporation level (sec. 108(d)(7)). The shareholders' basis in their stock is not adjusted by the amount of debt discharge income that is excluded at the corporate level\"). At least one commentator believes the same. See Loebl, Does the Excluded COD Income of an Insolvent S Corporation Increase the Basis of the Shareholders' Stock?, 52 U. Fla. L. Rev. 957, 981_988 (2000). But see Lockhart  Duffy, Tax Court Rules in Nelson that S Corporation Excluded COD Income Does Not Increase Shareholder Stock Basis, 25 Wm. Mitchell L. Rev. 287 (1999).~    ~    ~      34~      The Commissioner finds support for his literal, exclusive reading of 108(d)(7)(A)'s language in the fact that his reading would close a significant tax loophole. That loophole-preserved by the majority-would grant a solvent shareholder of an insolvent S corporation a tax benefit in the form of permission to take an otherwise unavailable deduction, thereby sheltering other, unrelated income from tax. See Witzel v. Commissioner, 200 F.3d 496, 497 (CA7 2000) (Posner, C. J.) (\"It is hard to understand the rationale for using a tax exemption to avoid taxation not only on the income covered by the exemption but also on unrelated income that is not tax exempt\"). Moreover, the benefit often would increase in value as the amount of COD income increases, a result inconsistent with congressional intent to impose a \"price\" (attribute reduction), see Lipton, Different Courts Adopt Different Approaches to the Impact of COD Income on S Corporations, 92 J. Tax. 207 (2000), on excluded COD. Further, this deduction-related tax benefit would have very different tax consequences for identically situated taxpayers, depending only upon whether a single debt can be split into segments, each of which is canceled in a different year. For example, under the majority's interpretation, a $1 million debt canceled in one year would permit Taxpayer A to deduct $1 million of suspended losses in that year, thereby permitting A to shelter $1 million of unrelated income in that year. But because 108 reduces tax attributes after the first year, five annual cancellations of $200,000 will not create a $1 million shelter. Timing is all important.~    ~    ~      35~      The majority acknowledges some of these policy concerns and confesses ignorance of any \"other instance in which 108 directly benefits a solvent entity,\" but claims that its reading is mandated by the plain text of 108(d)(7)(A) and therefore that the Court may disregard the policy consequences. Ante, at 13, and n. 10. It is difficult, however, to see why we should interpret that language as treating different solvent shareholders differently, given that the words \"at the corporate level\" were added \"[i]n order to treat all shareholders in the same manner.\" H. R. Rep. No. 98_432, pt. 2, p. 1640 (1984). And it is more difficult to see why, given the fact that the \"plain language\" admits either interpretation, we should ignore the policy consequences. See Commissioner v. Gillette Motor Transport, Inc., 364 U.S. 130, 134_135 (1960) (abandoning literal meaning of 26 U.S.C.  1221 (1958 ed.) for a reading more consistent with congressional intent). Accord, Commissioner v. P. G. Lake, Inc., 356 U.S. 260, 264_267 (1958); Corn Products Refining Co. v. Commissioner, 350 U.S. 46, 51_52 (1955); Hort v. Commissioner, 313 U.S. 28, 30_31 (1941).~    ~    ~      36~      The arguments from plain text on both sides here produce ambiguity, not certainty. And other things being equal, we should read ambiguous statutes as closing, not maintaining, tax loopholes. Such is an appropriate understanding of Congress' likely intent. Here, other things are equal, for, as far as I am aware, the Commissioner's literal interpretation of 108(d)(7)(A) as exclusive would neither cause any tax-related harm nor create any statutory anomaly. Petitioners argue that it would create a linguistic inconsistency, for they point to a Treasury Regulation that says that the Commissioner will apply hobby loss limitations under 183 \"at the corporate level in determining\" allowable deductions, while, presumably, nonetheless permitting the deduction so limited to flow through to the shareholder. Treas. Reg. 1.183_1(f), 26 CFR  1.183_1(f) (2000). But we are concerned here with the \"application\" of an exclusion, not with \"determining\" the amount of a deduction. Regardless, the regulation's use of the words \"at the corporate level,\" like the three other appearances of the formulation \"applied\" or \"determined\" \"at the corporate level\" in the Code, occur in contexts that are so very different from this one that nothing we say here need affect their interpretation. See 26 U.S.C.  49(a)(1)(E)(ii)(I) (determining whether financing is recourse financing); 26 U.S.C.  264(f)(5)(B) (1994 ed., Supp. IV) (determining how to allocate interest expense to portions of insurance policies); 26 U.S.C.  302(e)(1)(A) (determining whether a stock distribution shall be treated as a partial liquidation). If there are other arguments militating in favor of the majority's interpretation, I have not found them.~    ~    ~      37~      The majority, in footnote 6, says that the words \"at the corporate level\" in 108(d)(7)(A) apply to the exclusion of COD income from corporate income and to \"tax attribute reduction\" but do not \"suspen[d] the operation of _ ordinary pass-through rules\" because 108(d)(7)(A) \"does not state or imply that the debt discharge provisions shall apply only `at the corporate level.' \" It is the majority, however, that should explain why it reads the provision as nonexclusive (where, as here, its interpretation of the Code results in the \"practical equivalent of [a] double deduction,\" Charles Ilfeld Co. v. Hernandez, 292 U.S. 62, 68 (1934)). See United States v. Skelly Oil Co., 394 U.S. 678, 684 (1969) (requiring \"clear declaration of intent by Congress\" in such circumstances). I do not contend that 108(d)(7)(A) must be read as having exclusive effect, only that, given the alternative, this interpretation provides the best reading of 108 as a whole. And I can find no \"clear declaration of intent by Congress\" to support the majority's contrary conclusion regarding 108(d)(7)(A)'s effect. It is that conclusion from which, for the reasons stated, I respectfully dissent~    ~    ",

After Fiore's conviction became final, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court interpreted the statute for the first time, and made clear that Fiore's conduct was not within its scope. However, the Pennsylvania courts refused to grant Fiore collateral relief. We granted certiorari in part to decide when, or whether, the Federal Due Process Clause requires a State to apply a new interpretation of a state criminal statute retroactively to cases on collateral review.~    ~    ~      2~      In order to determine if that question was in fact presented, we asked the Pennsylvania Supreme Court whether its decision interpreting the statute not to apply to conduct like Fiore's was a new interpretation, or whether it was, instead, a correct statement of the law when Fiore's conviction became final. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, responding to our certified question, has now made clear that retroactivity is not at issue. At the same time, that court's interpretation of its statute makes clear that Fiore did not violate the statute. We consequently find that his conviction is not consistent with the demands of the Federal Due Process Clause. See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 316 (1979).~    ~    ~      3~      * This case, previously described in greater detail in our opinion certifying the state-law question to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, 528 U.S. 23 (1999), arises out of William Fiore's conviction under a Pennsylvania statute that prohibits \"operat[ing] a hazardous waste\" facility without a \"permit.\" Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 35, 6018.401(a) (Purdon 1993); see Commonwealth v. Fiore, CC No. 8508740 (Ct. Common Pleas, Allegheny Cty., Pa., Jan. 19, 1988), App. 6. The Commonwealth conceded that Fiore in fact had a permit, but argued that Fiore had deviated so dramatically from the permit's terms that he nonetheless had violated the statute. And the Commonwealth's lower courts agreed. See id., at App. 43_44; Commonwealth v. Fiore, No. 00485 PGH 1988 (May 12, 1989), App. 99_100 (affirming Fiore's conviction on the trial court's reasoning).~    ~    ~      4~      The Pennsylvania Supreme Court declined to review Fiore's case, Commonwealth v. Fiore, 525 Pa. 577, 575 A. 2d 109 (1990), and his conviction became final. Thereafter, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed to review the conviction of Fiore's co-defendant, David Scarpone, convicted of the same crime at the same time. The Supreme Court reversed Scarpone's conviction on the ground that the statute meant what it said: The statute made it unlawful to operate a facility without a permit; one who deviated from his permit's terms was not a person without a permit; hence, a person who deviated from his permit's terms did not violate the statute. Commonwealth v. Scarpone, 535 Pa. 273, 279, 634 A. 2d 1109, 1112 (1993) (describing the Commonwealth's interpretation as \"a bald fiction we cannot endorse\").~    ~    ~      5~      Fiore, unsuccessful in his subsequent state-court attempts to have his own conviction set aside, see Commonwealth v.

The District Court granted the writ, but the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed. 149 F.3d 221 (1998). The Court of Appeals believed that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, in Scarpone's case, had announced a new rule of law, inapplicable to Fiore's already final conviction. Id., at 227. And, the Court of Appeals said, \"state courts are under no [federal] constitutional obligation to apply their decisions retroactively.\" Id., at 222. We granted certiorari to determine whether Fiore's conviction was inconsistent with the Due Process Clause.~    ~    II~    ~      6~      Because we were uncertain whether the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision in Scarpone's case represented a change in the law of Pennsylvania, we certified the following question to that court:~    ~    ~      7~      \"Does the interpretation of Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 35, 6018.401(a) (Purdon 1993), set forth in Commonwealth v.

Our ruling merely clarified the plain language of the statute. . . .

Because Scarpone was not new law, this case presents no issue of retroactivity. Rather, the question is simply whether Pennsylvania can, consistently with the Federal Due Process Clause, convict Fiore for conduct that its criminal statute, as properly interpreted, does not prohibit.~    ~    ~      10~      This Court's precedents make clear that Fiore's conviction and continued incarceration on this charge violate due process. We have held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids a State to convict a person of a crime without proving the elements of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt. See Jackson, supra, at 316; In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (1970). In this case, failure to possess a permit is a basic element of the crime of which Fiore was convicted. Scarpone, supra, at 279, 634 A. 2d, at 1112. And the parties agree that the Commonwealth presented no evidence whatsoever to prove that basic element. To the contrary, the Commonwealth, conceding that Fiore did possess a permit, see Brief for Respondents 1, necessarily concedes that it did not prove he failed to possess one.~    ~    ~      11~      The simple, inevitable conclusion is that Fiore's conviction fails to satisfy the Federal Constitution's demands.

DAVIS, WARDEN, et al.~    No. 99-7504.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued October 30, 2000~    Decided January 10, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      Under 18 U.S.C.  3621(e)(2)(B), \"[t]he period a [federal] prisoner convicted of a nonviolent offense remains in custody after successfully completing a [substance abuse] treatment program may be reduced by the Bureau of Prisons\" (BOP). The BOP therefore ranked ineligible for early release all inmates incarcerated for \"crime[s] of violence.\" Initially, the BOP defined the term \"crimes of violence\" to include, among other offenses, a drug trafficking conviction under 21 U.S.C.  841 if the offender received a two-level sentence enhancement under United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (USSG) 2D1.1(b)(1), for possessing a dangerous weapon in connection with the drug offense. The Courts of Appeals thereafter divided over the validity of classifying drug offenses involving firearms possession as crimes of violence. The Circuit division prompted the BOP to issue the regulation now before the Court. That regulation denies early release to several categories of prisoners, including inmates whose current offense is a felony attended by \"the carrying, possession, or use of a firearm.\" 28 CFR  550.58(a)(1)(vi)(B). The BOP rests this denial not on a definition of \"crimes of violence,\" but on the BOP's asserted discretion to prescribe additional early release criteria.~      Petitioner Lopez was convicted of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C.  841. Finding that Lopez possessed a firearm in connection with his offense, the District Court enhanced his sentence by two levels pursuant to USSG 2D1.1(b)(1). While incarcerated, Lopez requested substance abuse treatment. The BOP found him qualified for its treatment program, but categorically ineligible, under 28 CFR  550.58(a)(1)(vi), for early release. Ordering the BOP to reconsider Lopez's eligibility for early release, the District Court held that the BOP may not categorically count out, based upon sentencing factors or weapon possession, inmates whose underlying conviction was for a nonviolent crime. The Eighth Circuit reversed. It reasoned that 3621(e)(2)(B)'s \"may _ reduc[e]\" formulation allows the BOP discretion to devise a regime based on criteria that can be uniformly applied. To the extent Congress left a gap in 3621(e)(2)(B) for the BOP to fill, the Court of Appeals stated, deference is owed the BOP's interpretation under Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843_845, 866, so long as the interpretation is a permissible construction of the statute. The BOP's decision to deny early release to drug traffickers who carry firearms, the court concluded, represents a manifestly permissible statutory construction and an appropriate exercise of discretion.~      Held: The regulation at issue is a permissible exercise of the BOP's discretion under 3621(e)(2)(B). Pp. 7_14.~      (a) Section 3621(e)(2)(B) gives the BOP discretion to grant or deny a sentence reduction, but leaves open the manner in which the discretion is to be exercised. If an inmate meets the two statutory prerequisites for sentence reduction-conviction of a nonviolence offense and successful completion of drug treatment-then 3621(e)(2)(B) instructs that the BOP \"may,\" not that it must, grant early release. The statute's use of the permissive \"may\" contrasts with Congress' use of a mandatory \"shall\" elsewhere in 3621 to impose discretionless obligations, e.g., the obligation to provide drug treatment when funds are available, see 3621(e)(1). Sensibly read, 3621(e)(2)(B)'s sentence reduction discretion parallels the grant of discretion in 3621(e)(2)(A) to retain a prisoner who successfully completes drug treatment \"under such [custodial] conditions as the [BOP] deems appropriate.\" The constraints Lopez urges-requiring the BOP to make individualized determinations based only on postconviction conduct-are nowhere to be found in 3621(e)(2)(B). Beyond instructing that the BOP has discretion to reduce the period of imprisonment for a nonviolent offender who successfully completes drug treatment, Congress has not identified any further circumstance in which the BOP either must grant the reduction, or is forbidden to do so. In this familiar situation, where Congress has enacted a law that does not answer the precise question at issue, all this Court must decide is whether the BOP, the agency empowered to administer the early release program, has filled the statutory gap in a way that is reasonable in light of the Legislature's revealed design. E.g., NationsBank of N. C., N. A. v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., 513 U.S. 251, 257. Pp. 7_11.~      (b) The BOP may categorically exclude prisoners from early release eligibility based on their preconviction conduct. The Court rejects Lopez's argument that the BOP may take into account only postconviction conduct. The BOP need not blind itself to preconviction conduct that the agency reasonably views as jeopardizing life and limb. By denying eligibility to violent offenders, the statute manifests congressional concern for preconviction behavior-and for the very conduct leading to conviction. The BOP may reasonably attend to these factors as well. The statute's restriction of early release eligibility to nonviolent offenders does not cut short the considerations that may guide the BOP in implementing 3621(e)(2)(B). See INS v. Yueh-Shaio Yang, 519 U.S. 26, 31. The Court also rejects Lopez's argument that the BOP must not make categorical exclusions, but may rely only on case-by-case assessments. Even if a statutory scheme requires individualized determinations, which this scheme does not, the decisionmaker has the authority to rely on rulemaking to resolve certain issues of general applicability unless Congress clearly expresses an intent to withhold that authority. E.g., Heckler v. Campbell, 461 U.S. 458, 467. The approach pressed by Lopez-case-by-case decisionmaking in thousands of cases each year-could invite favoritism, disunity, and inconsistency. Pp. 11_13.~      (c) The regulation excluding Lopez is permissible. The BOP reasonably concluded that an inmate's prior involvement with firearms, in connection with the commission of a felony, suggests his readiness to resort to life-endangering violence and therefore appropriately determines the early release decision. P. 13.~      186 F.3d 1092, affirmed.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT~      Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which O'Connor, Scalia, Souter, Thomas, and Breyer, JJ., joined. Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and Kennedy, J., joined.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      Congress has provided, in 18 U.S.C.  3621(e)(2)(B), that the Bureau of Prisons (Bureau or BOP) may reduce by up to one year the prison term of an inmate convicted of a nonviolent felony, if the prisoner successfully completes a substance abuse program. The Bureau's implementing regulation categorically denies early release to prisoners whose current offense is a felony attended by \"the carrying, possession, or use of a firearm.\" 28 CFR  550.58(a)(1)(vi)(B) (2000). The validity of the Bureau's regulation is the question presented in this case. We hold, in accord with the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, that the regulation is a permissible exercise of the Bureau's discretion under 18 U.S.C.  3621(e)(2)(B).~    ~    ~      2~      * A~    ~    ~      3~      Title 18 U.S.C.  3621 governs the imprisonment of persons convicted of federal crimes. In 1990, Congress amended the statute to provide that \"[t]he Bureau shall _ make available appropriate substance abuse treatment for each prisoner the Bureau determines has a treatable condition of substance addiction or abuse.\" Pub. L. 101_647, 2903, 104 Stat. 4913. Four years later, Congress again amended 3621, this time to provide incentives for prisoner participation in BOP drug treatment programs. The incentive provision at issue reads: \"The period a prisoner convicted of a nonviolent offense remains in custody after successfully completing a treatment program may be reduced by the Bureau of Prisons, but such reduction may not be more than one year from the term the prisoner must otherwise serve.\" Pub. L. 103_322, 32001, 108 Stat. 1897 (codified at 18 U.S.C.  3621(e)(2)(B)).~    ~    ~      4~      In 1995, the Bureau published a rule to implement the early release incentive. 60 Fed. Reg. 27692_27695; 28 CFR  550.58. Because the statute explicitly confined the incentive to prisoners convicted of \"nonviolent offense[s],\" 18 U.S.C.  3621(e)(2)(B), the BOP ranked ineligible for early release all inmates currently incarcerated for \"crime[s] of violence,\" 60 Fed. Reg. 27692. As explained in the Bureau's program statement, the BOP defined \"crimes of violence\" to include a drug trafficking conviction under 21 U.S.C.  841 if the offender received a two-level sentence enhancement under United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (USSG) 2D1.1(b)(1), for possessing a dangerous weapon during commission of the drug offense. Bureau of Prisons Program Statement No. 5162.02, 9 (July 24, 1995), reprinted in App. to Brief for Petitioner 17_18.1 \"[E]xercising [its] discretion in reducing a sentence,\" the Bureau also excluded from early release eligibility inmates who had a prior conviction \"for homicide, forcible rape, robbery, or aggravated assault.\" 60 Fed. Reg. 27692 (codified at 28 CFR  550.58 (1995)).~    ~    ~      5~      The Courts of Appeals divided over the validity of the Bureau's definition of crimes of violence to include drug offenses that involved possession of a firearm. A majority of Circuits, including the Eighth, held that 3621(e)(2)(B) required the Bureau to look only to the offense of conviction (drug trafficking), and not to sentencing factors (firearm possession), in determining whether an offender was convicted of a \"nonviolent offense,\" and was therefore eligible under the statute for the early release incentive. Martin v. Gerlinski, 133 F.3d 1076, 1079 (CA8 1998); see also Fristoe v. Thompson, 144 F.3d 627, 631 (CA10 1998); Byrd v. Hasty, 142 F.3d 1395, 1398 (CA11 1998); Roussos v. Menifee, 122 F.3d 159, 164 (CA3 1997); Downey v. Crabtree, 100 F.3d 662, 668 (CA9 1996). The Fourth and Fifth Circuits, however, upheld the Bureau's classification of drug offenses attended by firearm possession as violent crimes. Pelissero v. Thompson, 170 F.3d 442, 447 (CA4 1999); Venegas v. Henman, 126 F.3d 760, 763 (CA5 1997).~    ~    ~      6~      This split among the Circuits prompted the Bureau in 1997 to publish the regulation now before the Court. See 62 Fed. Reg. 53690_53691. Like the 1995 rule, the current regulation excludes from early release eligibility offenders who possessed a firearm in connection with their offenses. In contrast to the earlier rule, however, the 1997 regulation does not order this exclusion by defining the statutory term \"prisoner convicted of a nonviolent offense\" or the cognate term \"crimes of violence.\" Instead, the current regulation relies upon \"the discretion allotted to the Director of the Bureau of Prisons in granting a sentence reduction to exclude [enumerated categories of] inmates.\" Id., at 53690. The regulation, designed to achieve consistent administration of the incentive, now provides:~    ~    ~      7~      \"(a) Additional early release criteria. (1) As an exercise of the discretion vested in the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the following categories of inmates are not eligible for early release:~    ~    ~      8~      . . . . .~    ~    ~      9~      \"(iv) Inmates who have a prior felony or misdemeanor conviction for homicide, forcible rape, robbery, or aggravated assault, or child sexual abuse offenses;~    ~    ~      10~      . . . . .~    ~    ~      11~      \"(vi) Inmates whose current offense is a felony:~    ~    ~      12~      . . . . .~    ~    ~      13~      \"(B) That involved the carrying, possession, or use of a firearm or other dangerous weapon _ .\" 28 CFR  550.58(a)(2000).~    ~    ~      14~      In sum, the 1995 rule defined the statutory term \"prisoner convicted of a nonviolent offense\" to exclude categorically an inmate who possessed a firearm in connection with his offense. The current regulation categorically excludes such an inmate, not because 3621(e)(2)(B) so mandates, but pursuant to the Bureau's asserted discretion to prescribe additional early release criteria. Drug traffickers who possess firearms when they engage in crimes are no longer characterized as \"violent\" offenders within the meaning of the statute. But they are bracketed, for sentence reduction purposes, with persons currently incarcerated for \"nonviolent offense[s]\" who in the past committed crimes qualifying as violent. The preconviction conduct of both armed offenders and certain redicivists, in the Bureau's view, \"suggest[s] that they pose a particular risk to the public.\" Brief for Respondents 30.~    ~    B~    ~      15~      In 1997, petitioner Christopher A. Lopez was convicted of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C.  841. Upon finding that Lopez possessed a firearm in connection with his offense, the District Court enhanced his sentence by two levels pursuant to USSG 2D1.1(b)(1). Lopez is currently scheduled to be released from prison in June 2002.~    ~    ~      16~      While incarcerated, Lopez requested substance abuse treatment. The Bureau found him qualified for its residential drug abuse program,2 but categorically ineligible, under 28 CFR  550.58(a)(1)(vi), for early release. App. 3_7.~    ~    ~      17~      When notified that he would not be a candidate for early release, Lopez challenged the BOP's determination by filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, under 28 U.S.C.  2241 in the United States District Court for the District of South Dakota. The District Court granted the petition. In that court's view, the Bureau's 1997 regulation did not correct the infirmity the Eighth Circuit saw in the 1995 rule. See App. 17_18, and n. 4 (citing Martin, 133 F.3d, at 1079). \"[I]t is true,\" the District Court recognized, \"that the BOP may exercise a great deal of discretion in determining who among the eligible nonviolent offenders may be released.\" App. 17. But, the District Court held, the BOP may not categorically count out, \"based upon sentencing factors or weapon possession,\" inmates whose underlying conviction was for a nonviolent crime. Id., at 18. Accordingly, the District Court ordered the BOP \"to reconsider Lopez's eligibility for early release.\" Id., at 19.~    ~    ~      18~      The Eighth Circuit reversed. Bellis v. Davis, 186 F.3d 1092 (1999). Section 3621(e)(2)(B), the Court of Appeals observed, \"states only that the prison term of an inmate convicted of a nonviolent offense `may be reduced by the Bureau of Prisons.' \" Id., at 1094 (quoting 18 U.S.C.  3621(e)(2)(B)). This discretionary formulation, the Eighth Circuit reasoned, allows the Bureau to devise a regime based on criteria that can be uniformly applied. The statute grants no entitlement to any inmate or class of inmates, the Court of Appeals noted, and it does not instruct the Bureau to make \"individual, rather than categorical, assessments of eligibility for inmates convicted of nonviolent offenses.\" 186 F.3d, at 1094. The court further reasoned that, to the extent Congress left a gap in 3621(e)(2)(B) for the Bureau to fill, deference is owed the BOP's interpretation under Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843_845, 866 (1984), so long as the interpretation is a permissible construction of the statute. 186 F.3d, at 1095. The Bureau had elected to deny early release to certain categories of prisoners, notably recidivists and firearms carriers, whose \"conduct indicates that they pose a serious risk to public safety.\" Ibid. That decision, the Court of Appeals concluded, \"represents a manifestly permissible construction of the statute and an appropriate exercise of the BOP's discretion.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      19~      The Eighth Circuit next explained why its earlier decision in Martin did not control this case, which trains on the BOP's 1997 regulation: Martin addressed only the Bureau's 1995 attempt to interpret the statutory term \"nonviolent offense\"; the court in that case did not address \"whether the BOP may, as an exercise of its discretion, _ look to sentencing factors in deciding which individuals among statutorily eligible inmates are appropriate candidates for early release.\" 186 F.3d, at 1095. Facing that issue, the Court of Appeals held such an exercise of discretion proper. Ibid.~    ~    ~      20~      The Courts of Appeals have again divided, now over the permissibility of the Bureau's current (1997) regulation. The Tenth and Eleventh Circuits, in line with their prior decisions invalidating the 1995 rule, have concluded that 3621(e)(2)(B) permits no categorical exclusions of nonviolent offenders based on sentence enhancements. Ward v. Booker, 202 F.3d 1249, 1256_1257 (CA10 2000); Kilpatrick v. Houston, 197 F.3d 1134, 1135 (CA11 1999). The Ninth Circuit, on the other hand, has agreed with the Eighth Circuit that precedent invalidating the 1995 rule does not control and that, in 1997, the BOP permissibly exercised its discretion under 3621(e)(2)(B) when it categorically excluded from early release consideration inmates who possessed a firearm in connection with their nonviolent offenses. Bowen v. Hood, 202 F.3d 1211, 1218_1220 (2000).~    ~    ~      21~      We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict, 529 U.S. 1086 (2000), and now affirm the judgment of the Eighth Circuit.~    ~    II~    ~      22~      The statute provides: \"The period a prisoner convicted of a nonviolent offense remains in custody after successfully completing a treatment program may be reduced by the Bureau of Prisons _ .\" 18 U.S.C.  3621(e)(2)(B). The measure thus categorically denies early release eligibility to inmates convicted of violent offenses. The question we address is whether the Bureau has discretion to delineate, as an additional category of ineligible inmates, those whose current offense is a felony involving a firearm. 28 CFR  550.58(a)(1)(vi)(B) (2000).~    ~    ~      23~      Lopez urges that the statute is unambiguous. He says that, by identifying a class of inmates ineligible for sentence reductions under 3621(e)(2)(B), i.e., those convicted of a violent offense, Congress has barred the Bureau from identifying further categories of ineligible inmates. \"If Congress wanted the BOP to reduce the categories of inmates eligible for the early release incentive (beyond the one identified by Congress), Congress would have specifically placed this grant of authority in the language of the statute.\" Brief for Petitioner 23. As to the statutory instruction that the Bureau \"may\" reduce sentences, Lopez initially suggests it is merely a grant of authority to the BOP to reduce a sentence that, prior to the enactment of 3621(e)(2)(B), could not be reduced for successful completion of drug treatment: \"The power granted was to give reductions not the power to decide who was eligible to receive reductions.\" Id., at 21. He alternately contends that the Bureau may take into account only \"post-conviction conduct,\" not \"pre-conviction conduct.\" Reply Brief 4_5. Acting on a case-by-case basis, Lopez asserts, the Bureau may \"deny early release to those inmates [who] are statutorily eligible, but who do not deserve early release based on their conduct while in prison.\" Id., at 5. Under this reading, the Bureau may exercise discretion in denying early release, but only on an individual basis, taking account solely of postconviction conduct.~    ~    ~      24~      In the Bureau's view, 3621(e)(2)(B) establishes two prerequisites for sentence reduction: conviction of a nonviolent offense and successful completion of drug treatment. Brief for Respondents 18. If those prerequisites are met, the Bureau \"may,\" but also may not, grant early release. The BOP opposes Lopez's argument that Congress barred the Bureau from imposing limitations categorically or on the basis of preconviction conduct. According to the Bureau, Congress simply \"did not address how the Bureau should exercise its discretion within the class of inmates who satisfy the statutory prerequisites for early release.\" Id., at 23. Because Congress left the question unaddressed, the Bureau maintains, the agency may exclude inmates either categorically or on a case-by-case basis, subject of course to its obligation to interpret the statute reasonably, see Chevron, 467 U.S., at 844, in a manner that is not arbitrary or capricious, see 5 U.S.C.  706(2)(A). In this instance, the Bureau urges, it has acted reasonably: Its denial of early release to all inmates who possessed a firearm in connection with their current offense rationally reflects the view that such inmates displayed a readiness to endanger another's life; accordingly, in the interest of public safety, they should not be released months in advance of completing their sentences.3~    ~    ~      25~      We agree with the Bureau's position. Preliminarily, we note conspicuous anomalies in Lopez's construction. If 3621(e)(2)(B) functions not as a grant of discretion to determine early release eligibility, but both as an authorization and a command to reduce sentences, then Congress' use of the word \"may,\" rather than \"shall,\" has no significance. And if the BOP does have discretion to deny early release to certain inmates, but only based on individualized assessments of postconviction conduct, then the agency cannot categorically deny early release even to recidivists with prior (perhaps multiple) convictions for \"homicide, forcible rape _ , or child sexual abuse offenses.\" 28 CFR  550.58(a)(1)(iv) (2000). For that provision, as much as the exclusion of inmates imprisoned for offenses involving a firearm, see supra, at 4, entails no individualized determination based on postconviction conduct. Furthermore, Lopez's position would confine the BOP's discretion under 3621(e)(2)(B) to consideration of factors of the kind the Bureau already may consider in granting credit for \"satisfactory behavior.\" See 18 U.S.C.  3624(b)(1) (\"a prisoner [serving a term of more than one year and less than life] may receive credit toward the service of the prisoner's sentence _ subject to determination by the Bureau of Prisons that, during that year, the prisoner has displayed exemplary compliance with such institutional disciplinary regulations\").~    ~    ~      26~      We turn now to the Bureau's reading of the statutory text, which instructs that the agency \"may\" reduce the sentence of a nonviolent offender who has successfully completed a drug treatment program. Congress' use of the permissive \"may\" in 3621(e)(2)(B) contrasts with the legislators' use of a mandatory \"shall\" in the very same section. Elsewhere in 3621, Congress used \"shall\" to impose discretionless obligations, including the obligation to provide drug treatment when funds are available. See 18 U.S.C.  3621(e)(1) (\"Bureau of Prisons shall, subject to the availability of appropriations, provide residential substance abuse treatment (and make arrangements for appropriate aftercare)\"); see also, e.g., 3621(b) (\"The Bureau shall designate the place of the prisoner's imprisonment_ . In designating the place of imprisonment or making transfers under this subsection, there shall be no favoritism given to prisoners of high social or economic status.\"). Sensibly read, the grant of discretion in 3621(e)(2)(B) to decide whether to reduce a sentence parallels the grant of discretion in 3621(e)(2)(A) to retain a prisoner who successfully completes drug treatment \"under such [custodial] conditions as the Bureau deems appropriate.\" 3621(e)(2)(A). When an eligible prisoner successfully completes drug treatment, the Bureau thus has the authority, but not the duty, both to alter the prisoner's conditions of confinement and to reduce his term of imprisonment.~    ~    ~      27~      The constraints Lopez urges-requiring the BOP to make individualized determinations based only on postconviction conduct-are nowhere to be found in 3621(e)(2)(B). Beyond instructing that the Bureau has discretion to reduce the period of imprisonment for a nonviolent offender who successfully completes drug treatment, Congress has not identified any further circumstance in which the Bureau either must grant the reduction, or is forbidden to do so. In this familiar situation, where Congress has enacted a law that does not answer \"the precise question at issue,\" all we must decide is whether the Bureau, the agency empowered to administer the early release program, has filled the statutory gap \"in a way that is reasonable in light of the legislature's revealed design.\" NationsBank of N. C., N. A. v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., 513 U.S. 251, 257 (1995) (citing Chevron, 467 U.S., at 842); see also Reno v. Koray, 515 U.S. 50, 61 (1995) (deferring to BOP's interpretation of statute). We think the agency's interpretation is reasonable both in taking account of preconviction conduct and in making categorical exclusions.~    ~    ~      28~      First, as the dissent but not Lopez recognizes, see post, at 4, the Bureau need not blind itself to preconviction conduct that the agency reasonably views as jeopardizing life and limb. By denying eligibility to violent offenders, the statute manifests congressional concern for preconviction behavior-and for the very conduct leading to conviction. The Bureau may reasonably attend to these factors as well. Its regulation in this regard is kin to the Attorney General's order upheld in INS v. Yueh-Shaio Yang, 519 U.S. 26 (1996). That case involved a statute authorizing the Attorney General to waive deportation of aliens deportable for entry fraud. The Attorney General had refused to waive deportation for one alien because of \"acts of fraud _ in connection with his entry.\" Id., at 27. The alien argued that because the statute made aliens who had committed entry fraud eligible for waiver, the Attorney General was precluded from taking such conduct into account \"at all\" in deciding whether to grant relief. Id., at 30. We rejected this view, stating that the statute \"establishes only the alien's eligibility for the waiver. Such eligibility in no way limits the considerations that may guide the Attorney General in exercising her discretion to determine who, among those eligible, will be accorded grace.\" Id., at 31. Similarly in this case, the statute's restriction of early release eligibility to nonviolent offenders does not cut short the considerations that may guide the Bureau. Just as the Attorney General permissibly considered aspects of entry fraud, even though entry fraud was a criterion of statutory eligibility, so the Bureau may consider aspects of the conduct of conviction, even though the conviction is a criterion of statutory eligibility.4~    ~    ~      29~      We also reject Lopez's argument, echoed in part by the dissent, post, at 5, that the agency must not make categorical exclusions, but may rely only on case-by-case assessments.5 \"[E]ven if a statutory scheme requires individualized determinations,\" which this scheme does not, \"the decisionmaker has the authority to rely on rulemaking to resolve certain issues of general applicability unless Congress clearly expresses an intent to withhold that authority.\" American Hospital Assn. v. NLRB, 499 U.S. 606, 612 (1991); accord, Heckler v. Campbell, 461 U.S. 458, 467 (1983). The approach pressed by Lopez-case-by-case decisionmaking in thousands of cases each year, see supra, 12, n. 4-could invite favoritism, disunity, and inconsistency. The Bureau is not required continually to revisit \"issues that may be established fairly and efficiently in a single rulemaking proceeding.\" Heckler, 461 U.S., at 467.6~    ~    ~      30~      Having decided that the Bureau may categorically exclude prisoners based on their preconviction conduct, we further hold that the regulation excluding Lopez is permissible. The Bureau reasonably concluded that an inmate's prior involvement with firearms, in connection with the commission of a felony, suggests his readiness to resort to life-endangering violence and therefore appropriately determines the early release decision.7~    ~    ~      31~      For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is~    ~    ~      32~      Affirmed.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~          Title 21 U.S.C.  841(a)(1) and (2) make it unlawful \"to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance,\" or \"to create, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to distribute or dispense, a counterfeit substance.\" Section 2D1.1(b)(1) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a two-level sentence enhancement if a dangerous weapon was possessed in connection with the commission of a drug offense. See USSG 2D1.1(b)(1) and comment, n. 3 (Nov. 2000).~      ~      ~        2~          To qualify for residential substance abuse treatment, an inmate must be \"determined by the Bureau of Prisons to have a substance abuse problem\" and be \"willing to participate in [the] program.\" 18 U.S.C.  3621(e)(5)(B)(i), (ii).~      ~      ~        3~          The dissent straddles the fence, agreeing with Lopez that the statute addresses his case unambiguously, but disagreeing with him on precisely what the statute says. Lopez reads the statute to exclude Bureau consideration of preconviction conduct, Reply Brief 4_5; the dissent reads the same words to permit BOP consideration of such conduct, post, at 4 (Stevens, J., dissenting). These divergent readings hardly strengthen the dissent's assertion that Congress supplied a definitive answer to the \"precise question\" at issue. See post, at 1.~      ~      ~        4~          Lopez contends that the Bureau's creation of additional hurdles to receipt of a sentence reduction defeats Congress' purpose of giving inmates an incentive to undergo drug treatment. Brief for Petitioner 24_29. In INS v. Yueh-Shaio Yang, 519 U.S. 26 (1996), we said that \"[i]t could be argued that if the Attorney General determined that any entry fraud or misrepresentation, no matter how minor and no matter what the attendant circumstances, would cause her to withhold waiver, she would not be exercising the conferred discretion at all, but would be making a nullity of the statute.\" Id., at 31. In this case, it is plain that the Bureau has not rendered 3621(e)'s incentive a nullity. A total of 6,559 inmates have received sentence reductions under 3621(e)(2)(B), including 2,633 inmates in Fiscal Year 1999 alone. Bureau of Prisons, Substance Abuse Treatment Programs in the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Report to Congress 8 (Jan. 2000). Moreover, inmates who do not qualify for early release, like inmates who do, receive other incentives to participate in substance abuse treatment. See 28 CFR 550.57(a)(1), (3) (2000) (\"An inmate may receive incentives for his or her satisfactory involvement in the residential [drug treatment] program,\" including \"[l]imited financial awards\" and \"[l]ocal institution incentives such as preferred living quarters or special recognition privileges.\").~      ~      ~        5~          The dissent appears to acknowledge that the Bureau may give \"near-dispositive weight to preconviction criteria.\" Post, at 6. To the extent the dissent would permit the BOP to accord heavy weight to preconviction conduct, the structured \"[i]ndividualized [BOP] consideration\" the dissent would allow, post, at 5, seems but a shade different from the forthright categorical exclusion the Bureau has adopted.~      ~      ~        6~          Amici urge reversal on the ground that the Bureau violated the notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act when it published the 1997 regulation. Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. as Amici Curiae 18_24. We decline to address this matter, which was not raised or decided below, or presented in the petition for certiorari. Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 340, n. 3 (1997).~      ~      ~        7~          Lopez invokes the rule of lenity in urging us to accede to his interpretation. Because, as discussed above, the statute cannot be read to prohibit the Bureau from exercising its discretion categorically or on the basis of preconviction conduct, his reliance on the rule is unavailing. See Caron v. United States, 524 U.S. 308, 316 (1998) (\"The rule of lenity is not invoked by a grammatical possibility. It does not apply if the ambiguous reading relied on is an implausible reading of the congressional purpose.\"~      ~    ~    ~      33~      Justice Stevens, with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy join, dissenting.~    ~    ~      34~      The question at issue in this case is whether all, or merely some, of the federal prisoners who were convicted of nonviolent offenses and who have successfully completed a Bureau of Prisons (BOP) drug treatment program are eligible for a sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C.  3621(e)(2)(B). For the reasons outlined below, I believe that Congress has answered that precise question. The statute expressly states that the sentence of every prisoner in that category \"may be reduced.\" Ibid. The disposition of this case is therefore governed by the first step in the familiar test announced in Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842_843 (1984), for \"Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\" Id., at 842.~    ~    ~      35~      * In drafting the statute in question, Congress was faced with a difficult policy choice: whether the commission of particular crimes made certain categories of offenders so dangerous that the costs of offering them early release in return for the successful completion of a drug treatment program outweighed the rewards. The initial drafts of the bill answered that question in the negative and made all federal prisoners eligible for a sentence reduction of up to one year if they successfully completed a drug treatment program. See, e.g., H. R. Rep. No. 103_320, p. 2 (1993). However, the inclusion of those convicted of violent offenses within the category of those eligible for the inducement soon became a fulcrum of criticism for the larger crime bill within which the statute was embedded.1 Perhaps as a result of these criticisms,2 the statute ultimately adopted limited the inducement to \"pris- oner[s] convicted of _ nonviolent offense[s].\" 18 U.S.C.  3621(e)(2)(B).~    ~    ~      36~      Both the text of the statute and the aforementioned history demonstrate that Congress directly addressed the \"precise question\" of what offenses ought to disqualify prisoners from eligibility for a sentence reduction, and that its unambiguous answer was \"violent offenses.\" Under the statute as enacted, those who commit crimes of violence are categorically barred from receiving a sentence reduction while those convicted of nonviolent offenses \"may\" receive such an inducement.~    ~    ~      37~      The BOP regulation challenged here operates to redefine the set of prisoners categorically ineligible for a sentence reduction, a set unambiguously defined in the text of the statute. It does so by taking a group of prisoners whose offenses the Bureau acknowledges are \"nonviolent\" within the meaning of the statute3 and imposing the same sanction-categorical ineligibility-upon them as the statute imposes upon violent offenders. In so doing, the Bureau ignores Congress's express determination that, when evaluating eligibility for a sentence reduction, the salient distinction is the line between violent and nonviolent offenses. By moving this line, the BOP exceeded its authority and sought to exercise its discretion on an issue with regard to which it has none. See, e.g., Chevron, 467 U.S., at 842_843 (\"First, always, is the question whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress\"); United States v. Haggar Apparel Co., 526 U.S. 380, 392 (1999) (\"In the process of considering a regulation in relation to specific factual situations, a court may conclude the regulation is inconsistent with the statutory language or is an unreasonable implementation of it. In those instances, the regulation will not control\").~    ~    II~    ~      38~      I fully agree with the majority that federal prisoners do not become entitled to a sentence reduction upon their successful completion of a drug treatment program; the words \"may be reduced\" do not mean \"shall be reduced.\" Nonetheless, while the statute does not entitle any prisoner to a sentence reduction, it does guarantee nonviolent offenders who successfully complete a drug treatment program consideration for such a reduction.~    ~    ~      39~      For every nonviolent offender who participates in a drug treatment program, the BOP may be required to make two individualized determinations: (1) whether he or she has successfully completed that program; and (2), if so, whether his or her preconviction conduct, postconviction conduct, and prospects for rehabilitation justify a sentence reduction. In evaluating whether or not a particular individual is entitled to a sentence reduction, the BOP may give great weight to whichever of these factors it determines to be most relevant. That, however, is a far cry from categorically excluding from consideration prisoners who Congress explicitly intended to obtain such consideration.4~    ~    ~      40~      The majority's concern about the risks and burdens associated with case-by-case decisionmaking in a large number of cases is understandable yet ultimately misguided. In order to fulfill the statute's requirements, the BOP must already evaluate every prisoner seeking the sentence reduction on an individual basis to determine whether that prisoner \"successfully completed\" his or her drug treatment program. Individualized consideration of the second salient question involves consideration of many of the same personalized factors that go into determining whether a prisoner's course of drug treatment has been \"successful.\" To the extent that answering the second question requires consideration of additional factors with a concomitant administrative burden, the costs of such a scheme are, in Congress's judgment, outweighed by the benefits of encouraging drug treatment and of carefully distinguishing between those prisoners who have earned an early return to their communities and those who require further incarceration.~    ~    ~      41~      The majority's worry that individualized decisionmaking might lead to \"favoritism, disunity, and inconsistency\" is similarly misplaced. Ante, at 13. To suggest that decisionmaking must be individualized is not to imply that it must also be standardless. If the Court today invalidated the regulation in question, its decision would not preclude the BOP from adopting a uniform set of criteria for consideration in evaluating applications for sentence reductions. Nor would it necessarily preclude the Bureau from giving dispositive weight to certain postconviction criteria or near-dispositive weight to preconviction criteria. Cf. Heckler v. Campbell, 461 U.S. 458, 467 (1983). The Bureau would remain free to structure its decisionmaking in any way it saw fit as long as in so doing it did not contravene policy decisions explicitly made by the statute's drafters. As Congress has already addressed preincarceration conduct in 3621(e)(2)(B), the Bureau may not categorically exclude a prisoner not convicted of a violent offense from consideration for early release on the basis of such conduct without exceeding the limits of its discretion.~    ~    ~      42~      Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         Throughout 1993 and 1994, Republican leaders gave numerous speeches contrasting their proposed crime bill and the administration's. One contrast repeatedly stressed was that the Republican bill set aside more money for prison construction while the Democratic bill allocated greater funds to drug treatment. This difference allegedly reflected differing views as to how society should deal with violent criminals. To this end, Republican leaders repeatedly criticized the inclusion of violent criminals in the sentence reduction provision. See, e.g., 139 Cong. Rec. 27209 (1994) (remarks of Sen. Hatch) (\"Their treatment allows all Federal prisoners, including the most violent, to have their sentences reduced, if you will, at the Bureau of Prisons' discretion if they complete a drug treatment program. Boy, I can see where everybody is going to do that. You can imagine the sincerity of that\"); 139 Cong. Rec. 27460 (1994) (remarks of Sen. Hatch) (\"The Democratic crime bill actually permits the Bureau of Prisons to decrease the sentence of Federal inmates-violent offenders included-who complete drug treatment programs. Their bill also proposes that States be given grant money which can be used to implement home confinement and other alternative sanctions for violent offenders\").~      ~      ~        2~          The House initially approved a version of the bill that would have extended the inducement to all federal prisoners. The Senate, where the criticism of the inclusion of violent offenders was more pronounced, see n. 1, supra, limited the provision to nonviolent offenders. The Conference Committee accepted the Senate's limitation. H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 103_711, p. 381 (1994).~      ~      ~        3~          The BOP regulation challenged here treats an otherwise nonviolent offense where a gun was carried as a \"nonviolent offense\" within the meaning of the statute, and the case was argued on that assumption. As the majority notes, ante, at 2_4, the BOP initially attempted to classify such crimes as violent offenses, but receded when the Courts of Appeals divided over the validity of such a construction. The question over which the Courts of Appeals initially divided is not before us today. If it were, the arguments raised by both sides would be quite different, with the debate likely focusing on whether \"nonviolent offense\" is best understood as a term of art or in relation to a more colloquial understanding of violence.~      ~      ~        4~          This Court's decision in INS v. Yueh-Shaio Yang, 519 U.S. 26 (1996), relied upon by the majority, ante, at 11, is not to the contrary. Yueh-Shaio Yang did not involve an effort by an administrative agency to categorically exclude from consideration for a benefit a particular class of individuals because of a characteristic considered and rejected by Congress as a basis for categorical exclusion. Rather, that case involved the related yet distinct question whether such a characteristic may be given any weight by the agency in making an individualized case-by-case determination whether to grant the benefit to a particular individual. If the issue in this case were whether the BOP could even consider the nature of the offense in determining whether to grant a particular sentence reduction, Yueh-Shaio Yang would be relevant to our analysis.~      ~    ~    ",

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.MARK SELING, SUPERINTENDENT, SPECIAL COMMITMENT CENTER, PETITIONERv.ANDRE BRIGHAM YOUNG~    No. 99-1185.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued October 31, 2000~    Decided January 17, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      Washington State's Community Protection Act of 1990 (Act) authorizes the civil commitment of \"sexually violent predators,\" persons who suffer from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes them likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence. Respondent Young is confined under the Act at the Special Commitment Center (Center), for which petitioner is the superintendent. Young's challenges to his commitment in state court proved largely unsuccessful. Young then instituted a habeas action under 28 U.S.C.  2254 seeking release from confinement. The District Court initially granted the writ, concluding that the Act was unconstitutional. While the superintendent's appeal was pending, this Court decided Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, holding that a similar commitment scheme, Kansas' Sexually Violent Predator Act, on its face, met substantive due process requirements, was nonpunitive, and thus did not violate the Double Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto Clauses. The Ninth Circuit remanded for reconsideration in light of Hendricks. The District Court then denied Young's petition. In particular, the District Court determined that, because the Washington Act is civil, Young's double jeopardy and ex post facto claims must fail. The Ninth Circuit reversed that ruling. The \"linchpin\" of Young's claims, the court reasoned, was whether the Act was punitive \"as applied\" to Young. The court did not read Hendricks to preclude the possibility that the Act could be punitive as applied. Reasoning that actual confinement conditions could divest a facially valid statute of its civil label upon a showing by the clearest proof that the statutory scheme is punitive in effect, the court remanded the case for the District Court to determine whether the conditions at the Center rendered the Act punitive as applied to Young.~      Held: An Act, found to be civil, cannot be deemed punitive \"as applied\" to a single individual in violation of the Double Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto Clauses and provide cause for release. Pp. 9_16.~      (a) Respondent cannot obtain release through an \"as-applied\" challenge to the Act on double jeopardy and ex post facto grounds. The Act is strikingly similar to, and, in fact, was the pattern for, the Kansas Act upheld in Hendricks. Among other things, the Court there applied the principle that determining the civil or punitive nature of an Act must begin with reference to its text and legislative history. See 521 U.S., at 360_369. Subsequently, the Court expressly disapproved of evaluating an Act's civil nature by reference to its effect on a single individual, holding, instead, that courts must focus on a variety of factors considered in relation to the statute on its face, and that the clearest proof is required to override legislative intent and conclude that an Act denominated civil is punitive in purpose or effect. Hudson v. United States, 522 U.S. 93, 100. With this in mind, the Ninth Circuit's \"as-applied\" analysis for double jeopardy and ex post facto claims must be rejected as fundamentally flawed. This Court does not deny the seriousness of some of respondent's allegations. Nor does the Court express any view as to how his allegations would bear on a court determining in the first instance whether Washington's confinement scheme is civil. Here, however, the Court evaluates respondent's allegations under the assumption that the Act is civil, as the Washington Supreme Court held and the Ninth Circuit acknowledged. The Court agrees with petitioner that an \"as-applied\" analysis would prove unworkable. Such an analysis would never conclusively resolve whether a particular scheme is punitive and would thereby prevent a final determination of the scheme's validity under the Double Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto Clauses. Confinement is not a fixed event, but extends over time under conditions that are subject to change. The particular features of confinement may affect how a confinement scheme is evaluated to determine whether it is civil or punitive, but it remains no less true that the query must be answered definitively. A confinement scheme's civil nature cannot be altered based merely on vagaries in the authorizing statute's implementation. The Ninth Circuit's \"as-applied\" analysis does not comport with precedents in which this Court evaluated the validity of confinement schemes. See, e.g., Allen v. Illinois, 478 U.S. 364, 373_374. Such cases presented the question whether the Act at issue was punitive, whereas permitting respondent's as-applied challenge would invite an end run around the Washington Supreme Court's decision that the Act is civil when that decision is not before this Court. Pp. 9_13.~      (b) Today's decision does not mean that respondent and others committed as sexually violent predators have no remedy for the alleged conditions and treatment regime at the Center. The Act gives them the right to adequate care and individualized treatment. It is for the Washington courts to determine whether the Center is operating in accordance with state law and provide a remedy. Those courts also remain competent to adjudicate and remedy challenges to civil confinement schemes arising under the Federal Constitution. Because the Washington Supreme Court has held that the Act is civil in nature, designed to incapacitate and to treat, due process requires that the conditions and duration of confinement under the Act bear some reasonable relation to the purpose for which persons are committed. E.g., Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71, 79. Finally, the Court notes that an action under 42 U.S.C.  1983 is pending against the Center and that the Center operates under an injunction requiring it to take steps to improve confinement conditions. Pp. 13_15.~      (c) This case gives the Court no occasion to consider how a confinement scheme's civil nature relates to other constitutional challenges, such as due process, or to consider the extent to which a court may look to actual conditions of confinement and implementation of the statute to determine in the first instance whether a confinement scheme is civil in nature. Whether such a scheme is punitive has been the threshold question for some constitutional challenges. See, e.g., Allen, supra. However, the Court has not squarely addressed the relevance of confinement conditions to a first instance determination, and that question need not be resolved here.

Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      Washington State's Community Protection Act of 1990 authorizes the civil commitment of \"sexually violent predators,\" persons who suffer from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes them likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence. Wash. Rev. Code 71.09.010 et seq. (1992). Respondent, Andre Brigham Young, is confined as a sexually violent predator at the Special Commitment Center (Center), for which petitioner is the superintendent. After respondent's challenges to his commitment in state court proved largely unsuccessful, he instituted a habeas action under 28 U.S.C.  2254 seeking release from confinement. The Washington Supreme Court had already held that the Act is civil, In re Young, 122 Wash. 2d 1, 857 P.2d 989 (1993) (en banc), and this Court held a similar commitment scheme for sexually violent predators in Kansas to be civil on its face, Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346 (1997). The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit nevertheless concluded that respondent could challenge the statute as being punitive \"as applied\" to him in violation of the Double Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto Clauses, and remanded the case to the District Court for an evidentiary hearing.~    ~    ~      2~      * A~    ~    ~      3~      Washington State's Community Protection Act of 1990 (Act) was a response to citizens' concerns about laws and procedures regarding sexually violent offenders. One of the Act's provisions authorizes civil commitment of such offenders. Wash. Rev. Code 71.09.010 et seq. (1992 and Supp. 2000). The Act defines a sexually violent predator as someone who has been convicted of, or charged with, a crime of sexual violence and who suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility. 71.09.020(1) (Supp. 2000). The statute reaches prisoners, juveniles, persons found incompetent to stand trial, persons found not guilty by reason of insanity, and persons at any time convicted of a sexually violent offense who have committed a recent overt act. 71.09.030. Generally, when it appears that a person who has committed a sexually violent offense is about to be released from confinement, the prosecuting attorney files a petition alleging that that person is a sexually violent predator. Ibid. That filing triggers a process for charging and trying the person as a sexually violent predator, during which he is afforded a panoply of protections including counsel and experts (paid for by the State in cases of indigency), a probable cause hearing, and trial by judge or jury at the individual's option. 71.09.040_71.09.050. At trial, the State bears the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person is a sexually violent predator. 71.09.060(1).~    ~    ~      4~      Upon the finding that a person is a sexually violent predator, he is committed for control, care, and treatment to the custody of the department of social and health services. Ibid. Once confined, the person has a right to adequate care and individualized treatment. 71.09.080(2). The person is also entitled to an annual examination of his mental condition. 71.09.070. If that examination indicates that the individual's condition is so changed that he is not likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence, state officials must authorize the person to petition the court for conditional release or discharge. 71.09.090(1). The person is entitled to a hearing at which the State again bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that he is not safe to be at large. Ibid. The person may also independently petition the court for release. 71.09.090(2). At a show cause hearing, if the court finds probable cause to believe that the person is no longer dangerous, a full hearing will be held at which the State again bears the burden of proof. Ibid.~    ~    ~      5~      The Act also provides a procedure to petition for conditional release to a less restrictive alternative to confinement. 71.09.090. Before ordering conditional release, the court must find that the person will be treated by a state certified sexual offender treatment provider, that there is a specific course of treatment, that housing exists that will be sufficiently secure to protect the community, and that the person is willing to comply with the treatment and supervision requirements. 71.09.092. Conditional release is subject to annual review until the person is unconditionally released. 71.09.096, 71.09.098.~    ~    B~    ~      6~      Respondent, Andre Brigham Young, was convicted of six rapes over three decades. App. to Pet. for Cert. 33a. Young was scheduled to be released from prison for his most recent conviction in October 1990. One day prior to his scheduled release, the State filed a petition to commit Young as a sexually violent predator. Id., at 32a.~    ~    ~      7~      At the commitment hearing, Young's mental health experts testified that there is no mental disorder that makes a person likely to reoffend and that there is no way to predict accurately who will reoffend. The State called an expert who testified, based upon a review of Young's records, that Young suffered from a severe personality disorder not otherwise specified with primarily paranoid and antisocial features, and a severe paraphilia, which would be classified as either paraphilia sexual sadism or paraphilia not otherwise specified (rape). See generally American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 522_523, 530, 532, 634, 645_646, 673 (4th ed. 1994). In the state expert's opinion, severe paraphilia constituted a mental abnormality under the Act. The State's expert concluded that Young's condition, in combination with the personality disorder, the span of time during which Young committed his crimes, his recidivism, his persistent denial, and his lack of empathy or remorse, made it more likely than not that he would commit further sexually violent acts. The victims of Young's rapes also testified. The jury unanimously concluded that Young was a sexually violent predator.~    ~    ~      8~      Young and another individual appealed their commitments in state court, arguing that the Act violated the Double Jeopardy, Ex Post Facto, Due Process, and Equal Protection Clauses of the Federal Constitution. In major respects, the Washington Supreme Court held that the Act is constitutional. In re Young, 122 Wash. 2d 1, 857 P.2d 989 (1993) (en banc). To the extent the court concluded that the Act violated due process and equal protection principles, those rulings are reflected in subsequent amendments to the Act. See Part I_A, supra.~    ~    ~      9~      The Washington court reasoned that the claimants' double jeopardy and ex post facto claims hinged on whether the Act is civil or criminal in nature. Following this Court's precedents, the court examined the language of the Act, the legislative history, and the purpose and effect of the statutory scheme. The court found that the legislature clearly intended to create a civil scheme both in the statutory language and legislative history. The court then turned to examine whether the actual impact of the Act is civil or criminal. The Act, the court concluded, is concerned with treating committed persons for a current mental abnormality, and protecting society from the sexually violent acts associated with that abnormality, rather than being concerned with criminal culpability. The court distinguished the goals of incapacitation and treatment from the goal of punishment. The court found that the Washington Act is designed to further legitimate goals of civil confinement and that the claimants had failed to provide proof to the contrary. 122 Wash. 2d, at 18_25, 857 P.2d, at 996_1000.~    ~    ~      10~      The Act spawned several other challenges in state and federal court, two of which bear mention. Richard Turay, committed as a sexually violent predator, filed suit in Federal District Court against Center officials under Rev. Stat. 1979, 42 U.S.C.  1983 alleging unconstitutional conditions of confinement and inadequate treatment at the Center. In 1994, a jury concluded that the Center had failed to provide constitutionally adequate mental health treatment. App. 64_68. The court ordered officials at the Center to bring the institution up to constitutional standards, appointing a Special Master to monitor progress at the Center. The Center currently operates under an injunction. Turay v. Seling, 108 F. Supp. 2d 1148 (WD Wash. 2000). See also Brief for Petitioner 8_9.~    ~    ~      11~      Turay also appealed his commitment as a sexually violent predator in state court, claiming, among other things, that the conditions of confinement at the Center rendered the Washington Act punitive \"as applied\" to him in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. The Washington Supreme Court ruled that Turay's commitment was valid. In re Turay, 139 Wash. 2d 379, 986 P.2d 790 (1999) (en banc). The court explained that in Young, it had concluded that the Act is civil. 139 Wash. 2d, at 415, 986 P.2d, at 869. The court also noted that this Court had recently held Kansas' Sexually Violent Predator Act, nearly identical to Washington's Act, to be civil on its face. Ibid. The Washington Supreme Court rejected Turay's theory of double jeopardy, reasoning that the double jeopardy claim must be resolved by asking whether the Act itself is civil. Id., at 416_417, 986 P.2d, at 810 (citing Hudson v. United States, 522 U.S. 93 (1997)). The court concluded that Turay's proper remedy for constitutional violations in conditions of confinement at the Center was his 1983 action for damages and injunctive relief. 139 Wash. 2d, at 420, 986 P.2d, at 812.~    ~    C~    ~      12~      That brings us to the action before this Court. In 1994, after unsuccessful challenges to his confinement in state court, Young filed a habeas action under 28 U.S.C.  2254 against the superintendent of the Center. Young contended that the Act was unconstitutional and that his confinement was illegal. He sought immediate release. The District Court granted the writ, concluding that the Act violated substantive due process, that the Act was criminal rather than civil, and that it violated the double jeopardy and ex post facto guarantees of the Constitution. Young v. Weston, 898 F. Supp. 744 (WD Wash. 1995). The superintendent appealed. While the appeal was pending, this Court decided Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346 (1997), which held that Kansas' Sexually Violent Predator Act, on its face, met substantive due process requirements, was nonpunitive, and thus did not violate the Double Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto Clauses. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals remanded Young's case to the District Court for reconsideration in light of Hendricks. 122 F.3d 38 (1997).~    ~    ~      13~      On remand, the District Court denied Young's petition. Young appealed and the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded in part and affirmed in part. 192 F.3d 870 (1999). The Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's ruling that Young's confinement did not violate the substantive due process requirement that the State prove mental illness and dangerousness to justify confinement. Id., at 876. The Court of Appeals also left undisturbed the District Court's conclusion that the Act meets procedural due process and equal protection guarantees, and the District Court's rejection of Young's challenges to his commitment proceedings. Id., at 876_877. Young did not seek a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit for its decision affirming the District Court in these respects, and accordingly, those issues are not before this Court.~    ~    ~      14~      The Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court's determination that because the Washington Act is civil, Young's double jeopardy and ex post facto claims must fail. The \"linchpin\" of Young's claims, the court reasoned, was whether the Act was punitive \"as applied\" to Young. Id., at 873. The court did not read this Court's decision in Hendricks to preclude the possibility that the Act could be punitive as applied. The court reasoned that actual conditions of confinement could divest a facially valid statute of its civil label upon a showing by the clearest proof that the statutory scheme is punitive in effect. 192 F.3d, at 874.~    ~    ~      15~      The Court of Appeals reviewed Young's claims that conditions of confinement at the Center were punitive and did not comport with due process. Id., at 875. Young alleged that for seven years, he had been subject to conditions more restrictive than those placed on true civil commitment detainees, and even state prisoners. The Center, located wholly within the perimeter of a larger Department of Corrections (DOC) facility, relied on the DOC for a host of essential services, including library services, medical care, food, and security. More recently, Young claimed, the role of the DOC had increased to include daily security \"walk-throughs.\" Young contended that the conditions and restrictions at the Center were not reasonably related to a legitimate nonpunitive goal, as residents were abused, confined to their rooms, subjected to random searches of their rooms and units, and placed under excessive security.~    ~    ~      16~      Young also contended that conditions at the Center were incompatible with the Act's treatment purpose. The Center had a policy of videotaping therapy sessions and withholding privileges for refusal to submit to treatment. The Center residents were housed in units that, according to the Special Master in the Turay litigation, were clearly inappropriate for persons in a mental health treatment program. The Center still lacked certified sex offender treatment providers. Finally, there was no possibility of release. A court-appointed resident advocate and psychologist concluded in his final report that because the Center had not fundamentally changed over so many years, he had come to suspect that the Center was designed and managed to punish and confine individuals for life without any hope of release to a less restrictive setting. 192 F.3d, at 875. See also Amended Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, Supplemental Brief on Remand, and Motion to Alter Judgment 4_5, 8_9, 11_12, 15, 20, 24_26, in No. C94_480C (WD Wash.), Record, Doc. Nos. 57, 155, and 167.~    ~    ~      17~      The Ninth Circuit concluded that \"[b]y alleging that [the Washington Act] is punitive as applied, Young alleged facts which, if proved, would entitle him to relief.\" 192 F.3d, at 875. The court remanded the case to the District Court for a hearing to determine whether the conditions at the Center rendered the Act punitive as applied to Young. Id., at 876.~    ~    ~      18~      This Court granted the petition for a writ of certiorari, 529 U.S. 1017 (2000), to resolve the conflict between the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Washington Supreme Court. Compare 192 F.3d 870 (1999), with In re Turay, 139 Wash. 2d 379, 986 P.2d 790 (1999).~    ~    II~    ~      19~      As the Washington Supreme Court held and the Ninth Circuit acknowledged, we proceed on the understanding that the Washington Act is civil in nature. The Washington Act is strikingly similar to a commitment scheme we reviewed four Terms ago in Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346 (1997). In fact, Kansas patterned its Act after Washington's. See In re Hendricks, 259 Kan. 246, 249, 912 P.2d 129, 131 (1996). In Hendricks, we explained that the question whether an Act is civil or punitive in nature is initially one of statutory construction. 521 U.S., at 361 (citing Allen v. Illinois, 478 U.S. 364, 368 (1986)). A court must ascertain whether the legislature intended the statute to establish civil proceedings. A court will reject the legislature's manifest intent only where a party challenging the Act provides the clearest proof that the statutory scheme is so punitive in either purpose or effect as to negate the State's intention. 521 U.S., at 361 (citing United States v. Ward, 448 U.S. 242, 248_249 (1980)). We concluded that the confined individual in that case had failed to satisfy his burden with respect to the Kansas Act. We noted several factors: The Act did not implicate retribution or deterrence; prior criminal convictions were used as evidence in the commitment proceedings, but were not a prerequisite to confinement; the Act required no finding of scienter to commit a person; the Act was not intended to function as a deterrent; and although the procedural safeguards were similar to those in the criminal context, they did not alter the character of the scheme. 521 U.S., at 361_365.~    ~    ~      20~      We also examined the conditions of confinement provided by the Act. Id., at 363_364. The Court was aware that sexually violent predators in Kansas were to be held in a segregated unit within the prison system. Id., at 368. We explained that the Act called for confinement in a secure facility because the persons confined were dangerous to the community. Id., at 363. We noted, however, that conditions within the unit were essentially the same as conditions for other involuntarily committed persons in mental hospitals.  Ibid. Moreover, confinement under the Act was not necessarily indefinite in duration. Id., at 364. Finally, we observed that in addition to protecting the public, the Act also provided treatment for sexually violent predators. Id., at 365_368. We acknowledged that not all mental conditions were treatable. For those individuals with untreatable conditions, however, we explained that there was no federal constitutional bar to their civil confinement, because the State had an interest in protecting the public from dangerous individuals with treatable as well as untreatable conditions. Id., at 366. Our conclusion that the Kansas Act was \"nonpunitive thus remove[d] an essential prerequisite for both Hendricks' double jeopardy and ex post facto claims.\" Id., at 369.~    ~    ~      21~      Since deciding Hendricks, this Court has reaffirmed the principle that determining the civil or punitive nature of an Act must begin with reference to its text and legislative history. Hudson v. United States, 522 U.S. 93 (1997). In Hudson, which involved a double jeopardy challenge to monetary penalties and occupational debarment, this Court expressly disapproved of evaluating the civil nature of an Act by reference to the effect that Act has on a single individual. Instead, courts must evaluate the question by reference to a variety of factors \" `considered in relation to the statute on its face' \"; the clearest proof is required to override legislative intent and conclude that an Act denominated civil is punitive in purpose or effect. Id., at 100 (quoting Kennedy v. Mendozanbhyph;Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 169 (1963)).~    ~    ~      22~      With this in mind, we turn to the Court of Appeals' determination that respondent could raise an \"as-applied\" challenge to the Act on double jeopardy and ex post facto grounds and seek release from confinement. Respondent essentially claims that the conditions of his confinement at the Center are too restrictive, that the conditions are incompatible with treatment, and that the system is designed to result in indefinite confinement. Respondent's claims are in many respects like the claims presented to the Court in Hendricks, where we concluded that the conditions of confinement were largely explained by the State's goal to incapacitate, not to punish. 521 U.S., at 362_368. Nevertheless, we do not deny that some of respondent's allegations are serious. Nor do we express any view as to how his allegations would bear on a court determining in the first instance whether Washington's confinement scheme is civil. Here, we evaluate respondent's allegations as presented in a double jeopardy and ex post facto challenge under the assumption that the Act is civil.~    ~    ~      23~      We hold that respondent cannot obtain release through an \"as-applied\" challenge to the Washington Act on double jeopardy and ex post facto grounds. We agree with petitioner that an \"as-applied\" analysis would prove unworkable. Such an analysis would never conclusively resolve whether a particular scheme is punitive and would thereby prevent a final determination of the scheme's validity under the Double Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto Clauses. Brief for Petitioner 30; Reply Brief for Petitioner 9. Unlike a fine, confinement is not a fixed event. As petitioner notes, it extends over time under conditions that are subject to change. The particular features of confinement may affect how a confinement scheme is evaluated to determine whether it is civil rather than punitive, but it remains no less true that the query must be answered definitively. The civil nature of a confinement scheme cannot be altered based merely on vagaries in the implementation of the authorizing statute.~    ~    ~      24~      Respondent contends that the Ninth Circuit's \"as-applied\" analysis comports with this Court's precedents. He points out that this Court has considered conditions of confinement in evaluating the validity of confinement schemes in the past. Brief for Respondent 11_16, 29 (citing Hendricks, supra, at 363; Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 301_302 (1993); United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 747_748 (1987); Allen v. Illinois, 478 U.S. 364, 373_374 (1986); Schall v. Martin, 467 U.S. 253, 269_273 (1984)).~    ~    ~      25~      All of those cases, however, presented the question whether the Act at issue was punitive. Permitting respondent's as-applied challenge would invite an end run around the Washington Supreme Court's decision that the Act is civil in circumstances where a direct attack on that decision is not before this Court.~    ~    ~      26~      Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment, takes issue with our view that the question before the Court concerns an as applied challenge to a civil Act. He first contends that respondent's challenge is not a true \"as-applied\" challenge because respondent does not claim that the statute \" `by its own terms' is unconstitutional as applied _ but rather that the statute is not being applied according to its terms at all.\" Post, at 2. We respectfully disagree. The Act requires \"adequate care and individualized treatment,\" Wash. Rev. Code 71.09.080(2) (Supp. 2000), but the Act is silent with respect to the confinement conditions required at the Center, and that is the source of many of respondent's complaints, see supra, at 7_8. Justice Thomas next contends that we incorrectly assume that the Act is civil, instead of viewing the Act as \" `otherwise _ civil,' or civil `on its face.' \" Post, at 1 (emphasis added by Thomas, J.). However the Washington Act is described, our analysis in this case turns on the prior finding by the Washington Supreme Court that the Act is civil, and this Court's decision in Hendricks that a nearly identical Act was civil. Petitioner could not have claimed that the Washington Act is \"otherwise\" or \"facially\" civil without relying on those prior decisions.~    ~    ~      27~      In dissent, Justice Stevens argues that we \"incorrectly assum[e]\" that the Act is \"necessarily civil,\" post, at 2, but the case has reached this Court under that very assumption. The Court of Appeals recognized that the Act is civil, and treated respondent's claim as an individual, \"as-applied\" challenge to the Act. The Court of Appeals then remanded the case to the District Court for an evidentiary hearing to determine respondent's conditions of confinement. Contrary to the dissent's characterization of the case, the Court of Appeals did not purport to undermine the validity of the Washington Act as a civil confinement scheme. The court did not conclude that respondent's allegations, if substantiated, would be sufficient to refute the Washington Supreme Court's conclusion that the Act is civil, and to require the release of all those confined under its authority. The Ninth Circuit addressed only respondent's individual case, and we do not decide claims that are not presented by the decision below. Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Epstein, 516 U.S. 367, 379 (1996). We reject the Ninth Circuit's \"as-applied\" analysis for double jeopardy and ex post facto claims as fundamentally flawed.~    ~    III~    ~      28~      Our decision today does not mean that respondent and others committed as sexually violent predators have no remedy for the alleged conditions and treatment regime at the Center. The text of the Washington Act states that those confined under its authority have the right to adequate care and individualized treatment. Wash. Rev. Code 71.09.080(2) (Supp. 2000); Brief for Petitioner 14. As petitioner acknowledges, if the Center fails to fulfill its statutory duty, those confined may have a state law cause of action. Tr. of Oral Arg. 6, 10_11, 52. It is for the Washington courts to determine whether the Center is operating in accordance with state law and provide a remedy.~    ~    ~      29~      State courts, in addition to federal courts, remain competent to adjudicate and remedy challenges to civil confinement schemes arising under the Federal Constitution. As noted above, the Washington Supreme Court has already held that the Washington Act is civil in nature, designed to incapacitate and to treat. In re Young, 122 Wash. 2d, at 18_25, 857 P.2d, at 996_1000. Accordingly, due process requires that the conditions and duration of confinement under the Act bear some reasonable relation to the purpose for which persons are committed. Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71, 79 (1992); Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 324 (1982); Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 738 (1972).~    ~    ~      30~      Finally, we note that a 1983 action against the Center is pending in the Western District of Washington. See supra, at 6_7. The Center operates under an injunction that requires it to adopt and implement a plan for training and hiring competent sex offender therapists; to improve relations between residents and treatment providers; to implement a treatment program for residents containing elements required by prevailing professional standards; to develop individual treatment programs; and to provide a psychologist or psychiatrist expert in the diagnosis and treatment of sex offenders to supervise the staff. App. 67. A Special Master has assisted in bringing the Center into compliance with the injunction. In its most recent published opinion on the matter, the District Court noted some progress at the Center in meeting the requirements of the injunction. Turay v. Seling, 108 F. Supp. 2d, at 1154_1155.~    ~    ~      31~      This case gives us no occasion to consider how the civil nature of a confinement scheme relates to other constitutional challenges, such as due process, or to consider the extent to which a court may look to actual conditions of confinement and implementation of the statute to determine in the first instance whether a confinement scheme is civil in nature. Justice Scalia, concurring, contends that conditions of confinement are irrelevant to determining whether an Act is civil unless state courts have interpreted the Act as permitting those conditions. By contrast, Justice Stevens would consider conditions of confinement at any time in order to gain \"full knowledge of the effects of the statute.\" Post, at 3.~    ~    ~      32~      Whether a confinement scheme is punitive has been the threshold question for some constitutional challenges. See, e.g., Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346 (1997) (double jeopardy and ex post facto); United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987) (due process); Allen v. Illinois, 478 U.S. 364 (1986) (Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination). Whatever these cases may suggest about the relevance of conditions of confinement, they do not endorse the approach of the dissent, which would render the inquiry into the \"effects of the statute,\" post, at 3, completely open ended. In one case, the Court refused to consider alleged confinement conditions because the parties had entered into a consent decree to improve conditions. Flores, 507 U.S., at 301. The Court presumed that conditions were in compliance with the requirements of the consent decree. Ibid. In another case, the Court found that anecdotal case histories and a statistical study were insufficient to render a regulatory confinement scheme punitive. Martin, 467 U.S., at 272. In such cases, we have decided whether a confinement scheme is punitive notwithstanding the inherent difficulty in ascertaining current conditions and predicting future events.~    ~    ~      33~      We have not squarely addressed the relevance of conditions of confinement to a first instance determination, and that question need not be resolved here. An Act, found to be civil, cannot be deemed punitive \"as applied\" to a single individual in violation of the Double Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto Clauses and provide cause for release.~    ~    ~      34~      The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      35~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      36~      Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Souter joins, concurring.~    ~    ~      37~      I agree with the Court's holding that a statute, \"found to be civil in nature, cannot be deemed punitive\" or criminal \"as applied\" for purposes of the Ex Post Facto and Double Jeopardy Clauses. Ante, at 15. The Court accurately observes that this holding gives us \"no occasion to consider the extent to which a court may look to actual conditions of confinement and implementation of the statute to determine in the first instance whether a confinement scheme is civil in nature.\" Ante, at 14. I write separately to dissociate myself from any implication that this reserved point may be an open question. I do not regard it as such since, three years ago, we rejected a similar double jeopardy challenge (based upon the statute's implementation \"as applied\" to the petitioner), where the statute had not yet been determined to be civil in nature, and where we were making that determination \"in the first instance.\" See Hudson v. United States, 522 U.S. 93 (1997). To be consistent with the most narrow holding of that case (which, unlike this one, did not involve imposition of confinement), any consideration of subsequent implementation in the course of making a \"first instance\" determination cannot extend to all subsequent implementation, but must be limited to implementation of confinement, and of other impositions that are \"not a fixed event,\" ante, at 11. That, however, would be a peculiar limitation, since even \"fixed events\" such as the imposition of a fine can, in their implementation, acquire penal aspects-exemplified in Hudson by the allegedly punitive size of the fines, and by the availability of reduction for \"good-faith\" violations, see 522 U.S., at 97_98, 104. Moreover, the language and the reasoning of Hudson leave no room for such a peculiar limitation.~    ~    ~      38~      In that case, the petitioners contended that the punitive nature of the statute that had been applied to them could be assessed by considering the aforementioned features of the fines. We flatly rejected that contention, which found support in our prior decision in United States v. Halper, 490 U.S. 435 (1989). Halper, we said, had erroneously made a \"significant departure\" from our prior jurisprudence, in deciding \"to `asses[s] the character of the actual sanctions imposed,' 490 U.S., at 447, rather than, as Kennedy [v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144 (1963),] demanded, evaluating the `statute on its face' to determine whether it provided for what amounted to a criminal sanction, [id.], at 169.\" 522 U.S., at 101. The Kennedy factors, we said, \" `must be considered in relation to the statute on its face,' \" 522 U.S., at 100, quoting from Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 169 (1963). We held that \"[t]he fact that petitioners' `good faith' was considered in determining the amount of the penalty to be imposed in this case [a circumstance that would normally indicate the assessment is punitive] is irrelevant, as we look only to `the statute on its face' to determine whether a penalty is criminal in nature.\" Hudson, supra, at 104, quoting Kennedy, supra, at 169. We repeated, to be sure, the principle that the statutory scheme would be criminal if it was sufficiently punitive \" `either in purpose or effect,' \" Hudson, supra, at 99 (emphasis added), quoting United States v. Ward, 448 U.S. 242, 248_249 (1980), but it was clear from the opinion that this referred to effects apparent upon the face of the statute.~    ~    ~      39~      The short of the matter is that, for Double Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto Clause purposes, the question of criminal penalty vel non depends upon the intent of the legislature;1 and harsh executive implementation cannot \"transfor[m] what was clearly intended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty,\" Rex Trailer Co. v. United States, 350 U.S. 148, 154 (1956), any more than compassionate executive implementation can transform a criminal penalty into a civil remedy. This is not to say that there is no relief from a system that administers a facially civil statute in a fashion that would render it criminal. The remedy, however, is not to invalidate the legislature's handiwork under the Double Jeopardy Clause, but to eliminate whatever excess in administration contradicts the statute's civil character. When, as here, a state statute is at issue, the remedy for implementation that does not comport with the civil nature of the statute is resort to the traditional state proceedings that challenge unlawful executive action; if those proceedings fail, and the state courts authoritatively interpret the state statute as permitting impositions that are indeed punitive, then and only then can federal courts pronounce a statute that on its face is civil to be criminal. Such an approach protects federal courts from becoming enmeshed in the sort of intrusive inquiry into local conditions at state institutions that are best left to the State's own judiciary, at least in the first instance. And it avoids federal invalidation of state statutes on the basis of executive implementation that the state courts themselves, given the opportunity, would find to be ultra vires. Only this approach, it seems to me, is in accord with our sound and traditional reluctance to be the initial interpreter of state law. See Railroad Comm'n of Tex. v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 500_501 (1941).~    ~    ~      40~      With this clarification, I join the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~          Hudson v. United States, 522 U.S. 93 (1997), addressed only the Double Jeopardy Clause. Since, however, the very wording of the Ex Post Facto Clause-\"No State shall _ pass any _ ex post facto Law,\" U.S. Const., Art. I, 10, cl.1 (emphases added)-leaves no doubt that it is a prohibition upon legislative action, the irrelevance of subsequent executive implementation to that constitutional question is, if anything, even clearer.~      ~    ~    ~      41~      Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.~    ~    ~      42~      We granted certiorari to decide whether \"an otherwise valid civil statute can be divested of its civil nature\" simply because of an administrative agency's failure to implement the statute according to its terms. Pet. for Cert. i (emphasis added). The majority declines to answer this question. Instead, it assumes that the statute at issue is civil-rather than \"otherwise _ civil,\" or civil \"on its face.\" Young v. Weston, 122 F.3d 38 (CA9 1997). And then it merely holds that a statute that is civil cannot be deemed the opposite of civil-\"punitive,\" as the majority puts it-as applied to a single individual. Ante, at 15. In explaining this conclusion, the majority expressly reserves judgment on whether the manner of implementation should affect a court's assessment of a statute as civil in the \"first instance.\" Ante, at 11, 15. I write separately to express my view, first, that a statute which is civil on its face cannot be divested of its civil nature simply because of the manner in which it is implemented, and second, that the distinction between a challenge in the \"first instance\" and a subsequent challenge is one without a difference.~    ~    ~      43~      Before proceeding, it is important to clarify the issue in this case. The majority adopts the Ninth Circuit's nomenclature and refers to respondent's claim as an \"as applied\" challenge, see, e.g., ante, at 12, but that label is at best misleading. Typically an \"as applied\" challenge is a claim that a statute, \"by its own terms, infringe[s] constitutional freedoms in the circumstances of [a] particular case.\" United States v. Christian Echoes Nat. Ministry, Inc., 404 U.S. 561, 565 (1972) (per curiam) (emphasis added). In contrast, respondent's claim is not that Washington's Community Protection Act of 1990 (Washington Act), Wash. Rev. Code 71.09.010 et seq. (1992), \"by its own terms\" is unconstitutional as applied to him,1 but rather that the statute is not being applied according to its terms at all.2 Respondent essentially contends that the actual conditions of confinement, notwithstanding the text of the statute, are punitive and incompatible with the Act's treatment purpose. See ante, at 7_8.~    ~    ~      44~      A challenge, such as this one, to the implementation of a facially civil statute is not only \"unworkable,\" as the majority puts it, ante, at 11, but also prohibited by our decision in Hudson v. United States, 522 U.S. 93 (1997). In Hudson, we held that, when determining whether a statute is civil or criminal, a court must examine the \"statute on its face.\" Id., at 101, quoting Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 169 (1963) (internal quotation marks omitted). In so holding, we expressly disavowed the approach used in United States v. Halper, 490 U.S. 435, 448 (1989), which evaluated the \"actual sanctions imposed.\" 522 U.S., at 101, quoting Halper, supra, at 447 (internal quotation marks omitted). Respondent's claim is flatly inconsistent with the holding of Hudson because respondent asks us to look beyond the face of the Washington Act and to examine instead the actual sanctions imposed on him, that is, the actual conditions of confinement. Respondent argues, and the Ninth Circuit held, that Hudson's reach is limited to the particular sanctions involved in that case-monetary penalties and occupational disbarment-and does not apply here, where the sanction is confinement. Hudson, however, contains no indication whatsoever that its holding is limited to the specific sanctions at issue. To the contrary, as we explained in Hudson, a court may not elevate to dispositive status any of the factors that it may consider in determining whether a sanction is criminal.3 522 U.S., at 101. One of these nondispositive factors is confinement. Id., at 99 (stating that one of the factors is \"[w]hether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint,\" quoting Mendoza-Martinez, supra, at 168 (internal quotation marks omitted)). Yet elevating confinement to dispositive status is exactly what respondent asks us to do when he advances his distinction between confinement and other sanctions. Because Hudson rejects such an argument, respondent's claim fails.~    ~    ~      45~      An implementation-based challenge to a facially civil statute would be as inappropriate in reviewing the statute in the \"first instance,\" ante, at 11, 15 (majority opinion), as it is here. In the first instance, as here, there is no place for such a challenge in the governing jurisprudence. Hudson, which requires courts to look at the face of the statute, precludes implementation-based challenges at any time. Moreover, the implementation-based claim would be as \"unworkable,\" ante, at 11 (majority opinion), in the first instance as in later challenges. Because the actual conditions of confinement may change over time and may vary from facility to facility, an implementation-based challenge, if successful, would serve to invalidate a statute that may be implemented without any constitutional infirmities at a future time or in a separate facility. To use the majority's words, the validity of a statute should not be \"based merely on vagaries in the implementation of the authorizing statute.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      46~      And yet the majority suggests that courts may be able to consider conditions of confinement in determining whether a statute is punitive. Ante, at 12, 15. To the extent that the conditions are actually provided for on the face of the statute, I of course agree. Cf. Hudson, supra, at 101 (directing courts to look at \" `the statute on its face' \"). However, to the extent that the conditions result from the fact that the statute is not being applied according to its terms, the conditions are not the effect of the statute, ante, at 13, but rather the effect of its improper implementation.4 A suit based on these conditions cannot prevail.~    ~    ~      47~      * * *~    ~    ~      48~      The Washington Act does not provide on its face for punitive conditions of confinement, and the actual conditions under which the Act is implemented are of no concern to our inquiry. I therefore concur in the judgment of the Court.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~          Respondent has made the claim that the terms of the Washington Act are criminal so that his confinement under the Act thus violates the Double Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto Clauses, but this claim was rejected below-first by the Washington Supreme Court, In re Young, 122 Wash. 2d 1, 18_23, 857 P.2d 989, 996_999 (1993), and then by the Ninth Circuit, Young v. Weston, 192 F.3d 870, 874 (1999)-and has not been presented to this Court.~      ~      ~        2~          Disagreeing with this characterization, the majority contends that the statute is silent with respect to conditions of confinement. See ante, at 12. Even if the majority were correct-which it is not, see Wash. Rev. Code 71.09.070 (requiring annual examinations of each person's mental conditions); 71.09.080(2) (Supp. 2000) (requiring \"adequate care and individualized treatment\"); see also In re Young, 122 Wash. 2d, at 18_23, 857 P.2d, at 996_999 (discussing similar provisions on conditions of confinement in 1990 version of Washington Act)-the question on which we granted certiorari expressly assumes that the statute \"mandate[s]\" the \"conditions of confinement\" that petitioner seeks. See Pet. for Cert. i.~      ~      ~        3~          The Hudson Court referred to the seven factors listed in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144 (1963), as \"useful guideposts\": \"(1) whether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint; (2) whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment; (3) whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter; (4) whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment-retribution and deterrence; (5) whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime; (6) whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it; and (7) whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned.\" 522 U.S., at 99_100, quoting Mendoza-Martinez, supra, at 168_169 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).~      ~      ~        4~          The dissent argues that, \"under the majority's analysis, there is no inquiry beyond that of statutory construction,\" post, at 3. Although it is unclear to me whether the dissent is correct on this score, I hope that state and federal courts so interpret the majority opinion. For even if the majority opinion does not preclude venturing beyond the face of the statute, Hudson certainly does. See Hudson, 522 U.S., at 101 (holding that courts must examine a statute \" `on its face' \" and may not consider the \" `actual sanctions imposed' \"); supra, at 2_3.     To dispel any suggestion to the contrary, ante, at 9_10, 12, 15 (majority opinion); post, at 2 (Stevens, J., dissenting), I note that Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346 (1997) does not provide support for implementation-based challenges. In Hendricks, \"none of the parties argue[d] that people institutionalized under the _ civil commitment statute are subject to punitive conditions.\" Id., at 363. The viability of an implementation-based challenge was simply not at issue. And significantly, six months after Hendricks, we held in Hudson that inquiries into whether a statute is civil are restricted to the \"face\" of the statute. Hudson, supra, at 101. To the extent that Hendricks (or any previous opinion, ante, at 15 (majority opinion)) left a door open by not answering the implementation question, Hudson closed that door.~      ~    ~    ~      49~      Justice Stevens, dissenting.~    ~    ~      50~      A sexual predator may be imprisoned for violating the law, and, if he is mentally ill, he may be committed to an institution until he is cured. Whether a specific statute authorizing the detention of such a person is properly viewed as \"criminal\" or \"civil\" in the context of federal constitutional issues is often a question of considerable difficulty. See Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346 (1997) (reversing, by a 5 to 4 vote, a decision of the Kansas Supreme Court invalidating Kansas' Sexually Violent Predator Act); Allen v. Illinois, 478 U.S. 364 (1986) (upholding, by a 5 to 4 vote, Illinois' Sexually Dangerous Persons Act); In re Young, 122 Wash. 2d 1, 857 P.2d 989 (1993) (en banc) (upholding, by a 5 to 4 vote, the provisions of Washington's Community Protection Act of 1990 dealing with sexually violent predators).~    ~    ~      51~      It is settled, however, that the question whether a state statute is civil or criminal in nature for purposes of complying with the demands of the Federal Constitution is a question of federal law. If a detainee comes forward with \" `the clearest proof' that `the statutory scheme [is] so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate [the State's] intention'  that the proceeding be civil, it must be considered criminal.\" Allen, 478 U.S., at 369 (quoting United States v. Ward, 448 U.S. 242, 248_249 (1980)) (emphasis added). See also Hudson v. United States, 522 U.S. 93, 100, 105 (1997). Accordingly, we have consistently looked to the conditions of confinement as evidence of both the legislative purpose behind the statute and its actual effect. See Hendricks, 521 U.S., at 361, 367_369; Schall v. Martin, 467 U.S. 253, 269_271 (1984); Allen, 478 U.S., at 369, 373_374. As we have acknowledged in those cases, the question whether a statute is in fact punitive cannot always be answered solely by reference to the text of the statute.~    ~    ~      52~      The majority in this case, however, incorrectly assumes that the Act at issue is necessarily civil. The issue the majority purports to resolve is whether an Act that is otherwise civil in nature can be deemed criminal in a specific instance based on evidence of its application to a particular prisoner. However, respondent Young's petition did not present that issue. Rather, consistent with our case law, Young sought to introduce evidence of the conditions of confinement as evidence of the punitive purpose and effect of the Washington statute. See Amended Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus 6 and Supp. Brief on Remand 2, 6, 10_11, in No. C94_480C (WD Wash.), Record, Doc. Nos. 57, 155. As a result, Young in no way runs afoul of Hudson v. United States, 522 U.S. 93 (1997). Properly read, Hudson acknowledges that resolving whether an Act is civil or criminal in nature can take into account whether the statutory scheme has a punitive effect.1 Id., at 99. What Hudson rejects is an approach not taken by respondent-one that bypasses this threshold question in favor of a dispositive focus on the sanction actually imposed on the specific individual.2 Id., at 101_102.~    ~    ~      53~      To be sure, the question whether an Act is civil or punitive in nature \"is initially one of statutory construction.\" Ante, at 9 (majority opinion). However, under the majority's analysis, there is no inquiry beyond that of statutory construction. Ante, at 11. In essence, the majority argues that because the constitutional query must be answered definitively and because confinement is not a \"fixed event,\" conditions of confinement should not be considered at all, except in the first challenge to a statute, when, as a practical matter, the evidence of such conditions is most likely not to constitute the requisite \"clearest proof.\" This seems to me quite wrong. If conditions of confinement are such that a detainee has been punished twice in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause, it is irrelevant that the scheme has been previously labeled as civil without full knowledge of the effects of the statute.3~    ~    ~      54~      In this case, Young has made detailed allegations concerning both the absence of treatment for his alleged mental illness and the starkly punitive character of the conditions of his confinement. If proved, those allegations establish not just that those detained pursuant to the statute are treated like those imprisoned for violations of Washington's criminal laws, but that, in many respects, they receive significantly worse treatment.4 If those allegations are correct, the statute in question should be characterized as a criminal law for federal constitutional purposes. I therefore agree with the Court of Appeals' conclusion that respondent should be given the opportunity to come forward with the \"clearest proof\" that his allegations are true.~    ~    ~      55~      Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~          In his concurrence, Justice Scalia concludes that, under the rule of Hudson v. United States, 522 U.S. 93 (1997), courts may never look to actual conditions of confinement and implementation of the statute to determine in the first instance whether a confinement scheme is civil in nature. See ante, at 1. Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment, would take Hudson even further, precluding implementation-based challenges \"at any time.\" Ante, at 4. However, for the reasons set out above, I believe that both concurrences misread Hudson. I also note that Hudson did not involve confinement. In cases that do involve confinement, this Court has relied on the principle that a statutory scheme must be deemed criminal if it was sufficiently punitive \"either in purpose or effect.\" See Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 361, 367_369 (1997); Schall v. Martin, 467 U.S. 253, 269_271 (1984); Allen v. Illinois, 478 U.S. 364, 369, 373_374 (1986).~      ~      ~        2~          In response to my dissent, the Court has made it clear that it is simply holding that respondent may not prevail if he merely proves that the statute is punitive insofar as it has been applied to him. The question whether he may prevail if he can prove that the statute is punitive in its application to everyone confined under its provisions therefore remains open. In sum, the Court has rejected the narrow holding of the Ninth Circuit, but has not addressed the sufficiency of the broadest claim that petitioner has advanced.~      ~      ~        3~          In this case, those detained pursuant to Washington's statute have sought an improvement in conditions for almost seven years. Their success in the courts, however, has had little practical impact.~      ~      ~        4~          Under such conditions, Young has now served longer in prison following the completion of his sentence than he did on the sentence itself.~      ~    ~    ",

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.CITY NEWS AND NOVELTY, INC., PETITIONERv.CITY OF WAUKESHA~    No. 99-1680.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued November 28, 2000~    Decided January 17, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      The City of Waukesha, Wisconsin (City), requires sellers of sexually explicit materials to obtain and annually renew adult business licenses. When petitioner City News and Novelty, Inc. (City News), applied for a renewal of its adult business license, then due to expire in two months, Waukesha's Common Council denied the application, finding that City News had violated the City's ordinance in various ways. The denial was upheld in administrative proceedings and on judicial review in the state courts. Petitioning for certiorari, City News raised three questions, including whether the guarantee of a prompt judicial review that must accompany an adult business licensing scheme, see Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U.S. 51, 59; FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 229, means a prompt judicial determination on the merits of a permit denial, as some Federal Circuits have held, or simply prompt access to judicial review, as the Wisconsin Court of Appeals, below, and other courts have ruled. Because this Court granted the petition only on this question, City News cannot now contend that any of the substantive requirements governing adult business licenses in Waukesha conflict with the First Amendment. Nor does City News contend that the evidence failed to substantiate the charged violations.~      Held: Because City News is not properly situated to raise the question on which this Court granted review, the petition is dismissed and the judgment of the Wisconsin court is left undisturbed. Pp. 3_7.~      (a) This case has become moot. After petitioning for certiorari, City News withdrew its renewal application and ceased to operate as an adult business. City News no longer seeks to renew its license and currently expresses no intent to pursue a license. Accordingly, City News no longer has a legally cognizable interest in the outcome. E.g., County of Los Angeles v. Davis, 440 U.S. 625, 631. Neither of City News's arguments that the case remains fit for adjudication is persuasive. The Court rejects City News's contention that, because it never promised not to reapply for a license, a live controversy remains under Erie v. Pap's A. M., 529 U.S. 277. Erie differs critically from this case. In Erie, as in the instant case, the Court confronted an adult business' challenge to a city ordinance. There, the Court held that the controversy persisted, even after the adult business shut down, in part because the business could again decide to operate. Id., at 287. That speculation standing alone, however, did not shield the case from a mootness determination. Another factor figured prominently. The nude dancing entrepreneur in Erie sought to have the case declared moot after the business had prevailed below, obtaining a state-court judgment that invalidated Erie's ordinance. Id., at 288. Acceptance of the mootness plea would have resulted in dismissal of the petition, leaving intact the judgment below. See ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U.S. 605, 621, n. 1. As a result, Erie would have been saddled with an ongoing injury, i.e., the judgment striking its law, and the adult business arguably would have prevailed in an attempt to manipulate the Court's jurisdiction to insulate a favorable decision from review, 529 U.S., at 288. Here, in contrast, City News left the fray a loser, not a winner. Dismissal of the petition will not keep Waukesha under the weight of an adverse judgment, deprive the City of its state-court victory, or reward an arguable manipulation of the Court's jurisdiction. The Court also rejects City News's contention that it experiences ongoing injury because it is conclusively barred by Waukesha's ordinance from reopening as an adult business until 2005. It is far from clear whether City News actually suffers that disability. And a live controversy is not maintained by speculation that City News might be temporarily disabled from reentering a business that it has left and currently asserts no plan to reenter. See Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 15_16. Pp. 3_6.~      (b) City News's contention that it remains a qualified complainant also fails on another ground. Full briefing and argument have revealed that the Freedman question City News tendered, and which the Court took up for review, is not now and never was accurately reflective of City News's grievance. Unlike the initial license applicant whose expression cannot begin prepermission, City News was already licensed to conduct an adult business and sought to fend off a stop order. Swift judicial review is the remedy needed by those held back from speaking. The Court does not doubt that an ongoing adult enterprise facing loss of its license to do business may allege First Amendment injuries. Such an establishment's typical concern, however, is not the speed of court proceedings, but the availability of a stay of adverse action during the pendency of judicial review, however long that review takes. Unlike the Freedman petitioner, who sought, through swift court review, an end to the status quo of silence, City News sought to maintain, pendente lite, the status quo of speech (or expressive conduct). This Court ventures no view on the merits of an argument urging preservation of speech (or expressive conduct) as the status quo pending administrative and judicial review proceedings. That question is not the one on which the courts have divided or on which certiorari was granted here. Pp. 6_7.~      Certiorari dismissed. Reported below: 231 Wis. 2d 93, 604 N. W. 2d 870.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF WISCONSIN, DISTRICT II~      Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      In Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U.S. 51 (1965), a case involving a state motion-picture censorship scheme, the Court announced procedural requirements necessary to guard against unconstitutional prior restraint of expression. Those requirements included assurance of \"a prompt final judicial decision, to minimize the deterrent effect of an interim and possibly erroneous denial of a license.\" Id., at 59. Twenty-five years later, in FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990), the Court applied some of the Freedman standards to a municipal ordinance conditioning the operation of sexually oriented businesses on receipt of a license. Unsuccessful applicants for an adult-business license, the opinion announcing the judgment stated, must be accorded \"an avenue for prompt judicial review.\" Id., at 229.~    ~    ~      2~      Courts have divided over the meaning of FW/PBS's \"prompt judicial review\" requirement. Some have held that the unsuccessful applicant for an adult business license must be assured a prompt judicial determination on the merits of the permit denial. See, e.g., Baby Tam  Co. v. Las Vegas, 154 F.3d 1097, 1101_1102 (CA9 1998); 11126 Baltimore Blvd., Inc. v. Prince George's County, 58 F.3d 988, 999_1000 (CA4 1995) (en banc). Others, like the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin whose judgment is before us, 231 Wis. 2d 93, 115_116, 604 N. W. 2d 870, 882 (1999), have held that prompt access to court review suffices. See, e.g., Boss Capital, Inc. v. City of Casselberry, 187 F.3d 1251, 1256_1257 (CA11 1999); TK's Video, Inc. v. Denton County, 24 F.3d 705, 709 (CA5 1994). We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. 530 U.S. 1249 (2000). We now find, however, that the issue stemming from Freedman is not genuinely presented to us in this case. We therefore dismiss the petition and leave the judgment of the Wisconsin court undisturbed.~    ~    ~      3~      * The City of Waukesha, Wisconsin (City), requires sellers of sexually explicit materials to obtain and annually renew adult business licenses. See Waukesha Municipal Code 8.195(2), (7) (1995), reprinted in App. to Pet. for Cert. 101, 104. Petitioner City News and Novelty, Inc. (City News), pursuant to a City license first obtained in 1989, owned and operated an adult-oriented shop in downtown Waukesha. In November 1995, City News applied for a renewal of its license, then due to expire in two months. In December 1995, Waukesha's Common Council (Council) denied the application, finding that City News had violated the City's ordinance by permitting minors to loiter on the premises, failing to maintain an unobstructed view of booths in the store, and allowing patrons to engage in sexual activity inside the booths. Waukesha's refusal to renew City News's license was upheld in administrative proceedings and on judicial review in the state courts.~    ~    ~      4~      Petitioning for certiorari, City News raised three questions. First, City News asserted that the persuasion burden had been improperly assigned to it. Second, City News urged that Waukesha's ordinance unconstitutionally accorded City officials unbridled discretion to vary punishments for ordinance violations. Third, City News asked us to \"resolve the conflict among the circuits concerning whether the guarantee of prompt judicial review that must accompany [an adult business] licensing scheme means a prompt judicial determination or simply the right to promptly file for judicial review.\" Pet. for Cert. 13. We granted the petition only on the third question. Accordingly, City News cannot now contend that any of the substantive requirements governing adult business licenses in Waukesha conflict with the First Amendment. Nor does City News contend that the evidence failed to substantiate the charged violations. We now explain why City News is not properly situated to raise the question on which we granted review.~    ~    II~    ~      5~      In letters sent to Waukesha two months after petitioning for review in this Court, City News gave notice that it would withdraw its renewal application and close its business upon the City's grant of a license to another corporation, B. J. B., Inc., \"a larger and more modern business\" with which City News felt \"it could not effectively compete.\" Letters from Jeff Scott Olson to Vince Moschella (June 12 and 19, 2000), Respondent's Lodging, Vol. 1, Tab No. 14. Waukesha granted B. J. B.'s license application on June 20. It is undisputed that City News has ceased to operate as an adult business and no longer seeks to renew its license. Tr. of Oral Arg. 14_15.~    ~    ~      6~      Observing that City News neither now pursues nor currently expresses an intent to pursue a license under Waukesha law, Waukesha asserts that the case has become moot, for City News no longer has \"a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\" County of Los Angeles v. Davis, 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979) (citing Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 496 (1969)). We agree that the case no longer qualifies for judicial review. Urging that the case remains fit for adjudication, City News tenders two points. We find neither persuasive.~    ~    ~      7~      Noting that it \"has never promised not to apply for a license\" in the future, Reply Brief 1, City News first contends that, notwithstanding the voluntary termination of its license renewal effort, a live controversy remains under the Court's reasoning in Erie v. Pap's A. M., 529 U.S. 277 (2000). In our view, Erie differs critically from this case. In Erie, we similarly granted a petition to review a state-court judgment addressing an adult business' First Amendment challenge to a city ordinance. We concluded that the controversy persisted, even though the adult business had shut down. We reached that conclusion, it is true, in part because the business \"could again decide to operate.\" Id., at 287. That speculation standing alone, however, did not shield the case from a mootness determination. Another factor figured prominently. The nude dancing entrepreneur in Erie sought \"to have the case declared moot\" after the business had \"prevailed below,\" obtaining a judgment that invalidated Erie's ordinance. Id., at 288. Had we accepted the entrepreneur's plea, then consistent with our practice when a case becomes moot on review from a state court, we would have dismissed the petition, leaving intact the judgment below. See ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U.S. 605, 621, n. 1 (1989); Erie, 529 U.S., at 305 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). Thus, had we declared Erie moot, the defendant municipality would have been saddled with an \"ongoing injury,\" i.e., the judgment striking its law. Erie, 529 U.S., at 288. And the plaintiff arguably would have prevailed in an \"attemp[t] to manipulate the Court's jurisdiction to insulate a favorable decision from review.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      8~      In this case, we confront no parallel circumstance. The adult enterprise before us left the fray as a loser, not a winner. Our dismissal here does not keep Waukesha under the weight of an adverse judgment, or deprive Waukesha of its victory in state court. Nor does a mootness dismissal reward an arguable manipulation of our jurisdiction, for plaintiff City News, unlike the nude dancing entrepreneur in Erie, opposes a declaration of mootness.1~    ~    ~      9~      City News also urges that it experiences ongoing injury because it is conclusively barred by Waukesha's ordinance from reopening as an adult business until 2005. It is far from clear, however, whether City News actually suffers that disability.2 And as our prior discussion suggests, supra, at 4, a live controversy is not maintained by speculation that City News might be temporarily disabled from reentering a business that City News has left and currently asserts no plan to reenter. See Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 15_16 (1998).~    ~    ~      10~      City News's contention that it remains a qualified complainant also fails for a separate reason. Full briefing and argument have revealed that the question City News tendered, and which we took up for review, is not now and never was accurately reflective of City News's grievance. Unlike the initial license applicant whose expression cannot begin prepermission (the situation of the complainant in Freedman), City News was already licensed to conduct an adult business and sought to fend off a stop order. Swift judicial review is the remedy needed by those held back from speaking. We do not doubt that an ongoing adult enterprise facing loss of its license to do business may allege First Amendment injuries. Such an establishment's typical concern, however, is not the speed of court proceedings, but the availability of a stay of adverse action during the pendency of judicial review, however long that review takes.~    ~    ~      11~      Unlike the petitioner in Freedman, who sought, through swift court review, an end to the status quo of silence, City News sought to maintain, pendente lite, the status quo of speech (or expressive conduct). Brief for Petitioner 43_44. We venture no view on the merits of an argument urging preservation of speech (or expressive conduct) as the status quo pending administrative and judicial review proceedings. It suffices to point out that the question is not the one on which the courts have divided or on which we granted certiorari.~    ~    ~      12~      For the reasons stated, the writ of certiorari is~    ~    ~      13~      Dismissed.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~          City News appears to rely on the general rule that voluntary cessation of a challenged practice rarely moots a federal case. See, e.g., Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000). But that rule traces to the principle that a party should not be able to evade judicial review, or to defeat a judgment, by temporarily altering questionable behavior. See Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., 484 U.S. 49, 66_67 (1987) (\"Mootness doctrine _ protects plaintiffs from defendants who seek to evade sanction by predictable `protestations of repentance and reform.' \") (quoting United States v. Oregon State Medical Society, 343 U.S. 326, 333 (1952)); see also Friends of Earth, 528 U.S., at 189 (Courts are not \"compelled to leave `[t]he defendant _ free to return to his old ways.' \") (quoting City of Mesquite v. Aladdin's Castle, Inc., 455 U.S. 283, 289, n. 10 (1982)) (in turn quoting United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 632 (1953)). That principle does not aid City News. For it is City News, not its adversary, whose conduct saps the controversy of vitality, and City News can gain nothing from our dismissal.~      ~      ~        2~          City News points to Waukesha's rule that to receive an adult entertainment license, an applicant \"shall not have been found to have previously violated [the adult business ordinance] within 5 years immediately preceding the date of the application.\" Waukesha Municipal Code 8.195(4)(a)(2) (1995), reprinted in App. to Pet. for Cert. 103. It was in 1995, however, that Waukesha last found City News to have violated the City ordinance. As City News recognizes, the disabilities from these violations expired in 2000. Reply Brief 2. City News asserts that it remains vulnerable to the bar because, in violation of the ordinance, it operated without a license into the year 2000. But this argument runs up against the facts that, since 1995, City News has not \"been found\" by Waukesha's Common Council to have violated the ordinance, and that the Council expressly permitted City News to continue in business during the pendency of state-court proceedings.

Most of  the State's public high schools are members, representing 84% of the  Association's membership. School officials make up the voting membership of the  Association's governing council and control board, which typically hold meetings  during regular school hours. The Association is largely funded by gate receipts.  Association staff, although not state employees, may join the state retirement  system. The Association sets membership standards and student eligibility rules  and has the power to penalize any member school that violates those rules. The  State Board of Education (State Board) has long acknowledged the Association's  role in regulating interscholastic competition in public schools, and its  members sit as nonvoting members of the Association's governing bodies. When the  Association penalized petitioner Brentwood Academy for violating a recruiting  rule, Brentwood sued the Association and its executive director under 42 U.S.C.   1983 claiming that the rule's enforcement was state action that violated the  First and Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court granted Brentwood summary  judgment, enjoining the rule's enforcement, but the Sixth Circuit found no state  action and reversed.~      Held: The Association's regulatory activity is state action owing to the  pervasive entwinement of state school officials in the Association's structure,  there being no offsetting reason to see the Association's acts in any other way.  Pp. 5-17.~      (a) State action may be found only if there is such a \"close nexus between  the State and the challenged action\" that seemingly private behavior \"may be  fairly treated as that of the State itself.\" Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co.,  419 U.S. 345, 351. No one fact is a necessary condition for finding state  action, nor is any set of circumstances sufficient, for there may be some  countervailing reason against attributing activity to the government. The facts  that can bear on an attribution's fairness-e.g., a nominally private entity may  be a state actor when it is entwined with governmental policies or when  government is entwined in its management or control, Evans v. Newton, 382 U.S.  296, 299, 301-unequivocally show that a legal entity's character is determined  neither by its expressly private characterization in statutory law, nor by the  law's failure to acknowledge its inseparability from recognized government  officials or agencies. In National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Tarkanian, 488  U.S. 179, this Court anticipated that state action could be found when there is  public entwinement in the management or control of an organization whose member  public schools are all within a single State. Pp. 6-9.~      (b) The necessarily fact-bound inquiry leads to the conclusion of state  action here. The Association's nominally private character is overborne by the  pervasive entwinement of public institutions and public officials in its  composition and workings, and there is no substantial reason to claim unfairness  in applying constitutional standards to it. To the extent of 84% of its  membership, the Association is an organization of public schools represented by  their officials acting in their official capacity to provide an integral element  of secondary public schooling, interscholastic athletics. There would be no  recognizable Association without the public school officials, who overwhelmingly  determine and perform all but the Association's purely ministerial acts. Only  the 16% minority of private school memberships keeps the entwinement of the  Association and public schools from being total and their identities totally  indistinguishable. To complement the entwinement from the bottom up, the State  has provided entwinement from the top down: State Board members sit ex officio  on the Association's governing bodies and Association employees participate in  the state retirement system. Entwinement to the degree shown here requires that  the Association be charged with a public character and judged by constitutional  standards. Pp. 9-13.~      (c) Entwinement is also the answer to the Association's several arguments  that the instant facts would not support a state action finding under various  other criteria, e.g., the public function test, Rendellnbhyph;Baker v. Kohn,  457 U.S. 830, distinguished. Pp. 13-15.~      (d) Although facts showing public action may be outweighed in the name of a  value at odds with finding public accountability in the circumstances, e.g.,  Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U.S. 312, 322, no such countervailing value is  present here. The Association's fear that reversing the judgment will trigger an  epidemic of federal litigation is unfounded. Save for the Sixth Circuit, every  Court of Appeals to consider a statewide athletic association like this one has  found it to be a state actor, and there has been no litigation explosion in  those jurisdictions. Nor should the Association have dispensation merely because  the public schools themselves are state actors subject to suit under 1983 and  Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Pp. 15-16. 180 F.3d 758, reversed and remanded.~      CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT~      Souter, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Stevens, O'Connor,  Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined. Thomas, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in  which Rehhquist, C. J., and Scalia and Kennedy, JJ., joined.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      The issue is whether a statewide association incorporated to regulate  interscholastic athletic competition among public and private secondary schools  may be regarded as engaging in state action when it enforces a rule against a  member school. The association in question here includes most public schools  located within the State, acts through their representatives, draws its officers  from them, is largely funded by their dues and income received in their stead,  and has historically been seen to regulate in lieu of the State Board of  Education's exercise of its own authority. We hold that the association's  regulatory activity may and should be treated as state action owing to the  pervasive entwinement of state school officials in the structure of the  association, there being no offsetting reason to see the association's acts in  any other way.~    ~    ~      2~      * Respondent Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association (Association) is  a not-for-profit membership corporation organized to regulate interscholastic  sport among the public and private high schools in Tennessee that belong to it.  No school is forced to join, but without any other authority actually regulating  interscholastic athletics, it enjoys the memberships of almost all the State's  public high schools (some 290 of them or 84% of the Association's voting  membership), far outnumbering the 55 private schools that belong. A member  school's team may play or scrimmage only against the team of another member,  absent a dispensation.~    ~    ~      3~      The Association's rulemaking arm is its legislative council, while its board  of control tends to administration. The voting membership of each of these  nine-person committees is limited under the Association's bylaws to high school  principals, assistant principals, and superintendents elected by the member  schools, and the public school administrators who so serve typically attend  meetings during regular school hours. Although the Association's staff members  are not paid by the State, they are eligible to join the State's public  retirement system for its employees. Member schools pay dues to the Association,  though the bulk of its revenue is gate receipts at member teams' football and  basketball tournaments, many of them held in public arenas rented by the  Association.~    ~    ~      4~      The constitution, bylaws, and rules of the Association set standards of  school membership and the eligibility of students to play in interscholastic  games. Each school, for example, is regulated in awarding financial aid, most  coaches must have a Tennessee state teaching license, and players must meet  minimum academic standards and hew to limits on student employment. Under the  bylaws, \"in all matters pertaining to the athletic relations of his school,\"  App. 138, the principal is responsible to the Association, which has the power  \"to suspend, to fine, or otherwise penalize any member school for the violation  of any of the rules of the Association or for other just cause,\" id., at 100.~    ~    ~      5~      Ever since the Association was incorporated in 1925, Tennessee's State Board  of Education (State Board) has (to use its own words) acknowledged the  corporation's functions \"in providing standards, rules and regulations for  interscholastic competition in the public schools of Tennessee,\" id., at 211.  More recently, the State Board cited its statutory authority, Tenn. Code Ann.  49-1-302 (App. 220), when it adopted language expressing the relationship  between the Association and the Board. Specifically, in 1972, it went so far as  to adopt a rule expressly \"designat[ing]\" the Association as \"the organization  to supervise and regulate the athletic activities in which the public junior and  senior high schools in Tennessee participate on an interscholastic basis.\"  Tennessee State Board of Education, Administrative Rules and Regulations, Rule  0520-1-2-.26 (1972) (later moved to Rule 0520-1-2-.08). The Rule provided that  \"the authority granted herein shall remain in effect until revoked\" and  instructed the State Board's chairman to \"designate a person or persons to serve  in an ex-officio capacity on the [Association's governing bodies].\" App. 211.  That same year, the State Board specifically approved the Association's rules  and regulations, while reserving the right to review future changes. Thus, on  several occasions over the next 20 years, the State Board reviewed, approved, or  reaffirmed its approval of the recruiting Rule at issue in this case. In 1996,  however, the State Board dropped the original Rule 0520-1-2-.08 expressly  designating the Association as regulator; it substituted a statement  \"recogniz[ing] the value of participation in interscholastic athletics and the  role of [the Association] in coordinating interscholastic athletic competition,\"  while \"authoriz[ing] the public schools of the state to voluntarily maintain  membership in [the Association].\" Id., at 220.~    ~    ~      6~      The action before us responds to a 1997 regulatory enforcement proceeding  brought against petitioner, Brentwood Academy, a private parochial high school  member of the Association. The Association's board of control found that  Brentwood violated a rule prohibiting \"undue influence\" in recruiting athletes,  when it wrote to incoming students and their parents about spring football  practice. The Association accordingly placed Brentwood's athletic program on  probation for four years, declared its football and boys' basketball teams  ineligible to compete in playoffs for two years, and imposed a $3,000 fine. When  these penalties were imposed, all the voting members of the board of control and  legislative council were public school administrators.~    ~    ~      7~      Brentwood sued the Association and its executive director in federal court  under Rev. Stat. 1979, 42 U.S.C.  1983 claiming that enforcement of the Rule  was state action and a violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The  District Court entered summary judgment for Brentwood and enjoined the  Association from enforcing the Rule. 13 F. Supp. 2d 670 (MD Tenn. 1998). In  holding the Association to be a state actor under 1983 and the Fourteenth  Amendment, the District Court found that the State had delegated authority over  high school athletics to the Association, characterized the relationship between  the Association and its public school members as symbiotic, and emphasized the  predominantly public character of the Association's membership and leadership.  The court relied on language in National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Tarkanian,  488 U.S. 179, 193, n. 13 (1988), suggesting that statewide interscholastic  athletic associations are state actors, and on other federal cases in which such  organizations had uniformly been held to be acting under color of state law.~    ~    ~      8~      The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed. 180 F.3d  758 (1999). It recognized that there is no single test to identify state actions  and state actors but applied three criteria derived from Blum v. Yaretsky, 457  U.S. 991 (1982), Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922 (1982), and  Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U.S. 830 (1982), and found no state action  under any of them. It said the District Court was mistaken in seeing a symbiotic  relationship between the State and the Association, it emphasized that the  Association was neither engaging in a traditional and exclusive public function  nor responding to state compulsion, and it gave short shrift to the language  from Tarkanian on which the District Court relied. Rehearing en banc was later  denied over the dissent of two judges, who criticized the panel decision for  creating a conflict among state and federal courts, for being inconsistent with  Tarkanian, and for lacking support in the \"functional\" analysis of private  activity required by West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42 (1988), for assessing the  significance of cooperation between public officials and a private actor. 190  F.3d 705 (CA6 1999) (Merritt, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).~    ~    ~      9~      We granted certiorari, 528 U.S. 1153 (2000), to resolve the conflict1 and  now reverse.~    ~    II~    ~      10~      * Our cases try to plot a line between state action subject to Fourteenth  Amendment scrutiny and private conduct (however exceptionable) that is not.  Tarkanian, supra, at 191; Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U.S. 345, 349  (1974). The judicial obligation is not only to \" 'preserv[e] an area of  individual freedom by limiting the reach of federal law' and avoi[d] the  imposition of responsibility on a State for conduct it could not control,\"  Tarkanian, supra, at 191 (quoting Lugar, supra, at 936-937), but also to assure  that constitutional standards are invoked \"when it can be said that the State is  responsible for the specific conduct of which the plaintiff complains,\" Blum,  supra, at 1004 (emphasis in original). If the Fourteenth Amendment is not to be  displaced, therefore, its ambit cannot be a simple line between States and  people operating outside formally governmental organizations, and the deed of an  ostensibly private organization or individual is to be treated sometimes as if a  State had caused it to be performed. Thus, we say that state action may be found  if, though only if, there is such a \"close nexus between the State and the  challenged action\" that seemingly private behavior \"may be fairly treated as  that of the State itself.\" Jackson, supra, at 351.2~    ~    ~      11~      What is fairly attributable is a matter of normative judgment, and the  criteria lack rigid simplicity. From the range of circumstances that could point  toward the State behind an individual face, no one fact can function as a  necessary condition across the board for finding state action; nor is any set of  circumstances absolutely sufficient, for there may be some countervailing reason  against attributing activity to the government. See Tarkanian, 488 U.S., at 193,  196; Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U.S. 312 (1981).~    ~    ~      12~      Our cases have identified a host of facts that can bear on the fairness of  such an attribution. We have, for example, held that a challenged activity may  be state action when it results from the State's exercise of \"coercive power,\"  Blum, 457 U.S., at 1004, when the State provides \"significant encouragement,  either overt or covert,\" ibid., or when a private actor operates as a \"willful  participant in joint activity with the State or its agents,\" Lugar, supra, at  941 (internal quotation marks omitted). We have treated a nominally private  entity as a state actor when it is controlled by an \"agency of the State,\"  Pennsylvania v. Board of Directors of City Trusts of Philadelphia, 353 U.S. 230,  231 (1957) (per curiam), when it has been delegated a public function by the  State, cf., e.g., West v. Atkins, supra, at 56; Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete  Co., 500 U.S. 614, 627-628 (1991), when it is \"entwined with governmental  policies\" or when government is \"entwined in [its] management or control,\" Evans  v. Newton, 382 U.S. 296, 299, 301 (1966).~    ~    ~      13~      Amidst such variety, examples may be the best teachers, and examples from  our cases are unequivocal in showing that the character of a legal entity is  determined neither by its expressly private characterization in statutory law,  nor by the failure of the law to acknowledge the entity's inseparability from  recognized government officials or agencies. Lebron v. National Railroad  Passenger Corporation, 513 U.S. 374 (1995), held that Amtrak was the Government  for constitutional purposes, regardless of its congressional designation as  private; it was organized under federal law to attain governmental objectives  and was directed and controlled by federal appointees. Pennsylvania v. Board of  Directors of City Trusts of Philadelphia, supra, held the privately endowed  Gerard College to be a state actor and enforcement of its private founder's  limitation of admission to whites attributable to the State, because, consistent  with the terms of the settlor's gift, the college's board of directors was a  state agency established by state law. Ostensibly the converse situation  occurred in Evans v. Newton, supra, which held that private trustees to whom a  city had transferred a park were nonetheless state actors barred from enforcing  racial segregation, since the park served the public purpose of providing  community recreation, and \"the municipality remain[ed] entwined in [its]  management [and] control,\" id., at 301.~    ~    ~      14~      These examples of public entwinement in the management and control of  ostensibly separate trusts or corporations foreshadow this case, as this Court  itself anticipated in Tarkanian, supra. Tarkanian arose when an undoubtedly  state actor, the University of Nevada, suspended its basketball coach,  Tarkanian, in order to comply with rules and recommendations of the National  Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The coach charged the NCAA with state  action, arguing that the state university had delegated its own functions to the  NCAA, clothing the latter with authority to make and apply the university's  rules, the result being joint action making the NCAA a state actor.~    ~    ~      15~      To be sure, it is not the strict holding in Tarkanian that points to our  view of this case, for we found no state action on the part of the NCAA. We  could see, on the one hand, that the university had some part in setting the  NCAA's rules, and the Supreme Court of Nevada had gone so far as to hold that  the NCAA had been delegated the university's traditionally exclusive public  authority over personnel. Id., at 190. But on the other side, the NCAA's  policies were shaped not by the University of Nevada alone, but by several  hundred member institutions, most of them having no connection with Nevada, and  exhibiting no color of Nevada law. Id., at 193. Since it was difficult to see  the NCAA, not as a collective membership, but as surrogate for the one State, we  held the organization's connection with Nevada too insubstantial to ground a  state action claim. Id., at 193, 196.~    ~    ~      16~      But dictum in Tarkanian pointed to a contrary result on facts like ours,  with an organization whose member public schools are all within a single State.  \"The situation would, of course, be different if the [Association's] membership  consisted entirely of institutions located within the same State, many of them  public institutions created by the same sovereign.\" Id., at 193, n. 13. To  support our surmise, we approvingly cited two cases: Clark v. Arizona  Interscholastic Assn., 695 F.2d 1126 (CA9 1982), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 818  (1983), a challenge to a state high school athletic association that kept boys  from playing on girls' interscholastic volleyball teams in Arizona; and  Louisiana High School Athletic Assn. v. St. Augustine High School, 396 F.2d 224  (CA5 1968), a parochial school's attack on the racially segregated system of  interscholastic high school athletics maintained by the athletic association. In  each instance, the Court of Appeals treated the athletic association as a state  actor.~    ~    B~    ~      17~      Just as we foresaw in Tarkanian, the \"necessarily fact-bound inquiry,\"  Lugar, 457 U.S., at 939, leads to the conclusion of state action here. The  nominally private character of the Association is overborne by the pervasive  entwinement of public institutions and public officials in its composition and  workings, and there is no substantial reason to claim unfairness in applying  constitutional standards to it.~    ~    ~      18~      The Association is not an organization of natural persons acting on their  own, but of schools, and of public schools to the extent of 84% of the total.  Under the Association's bylaws, each member school is represented by its  principal or a faculty member, who has a vote in selecting members of the  governing legislative council and board of control from eligible principals,  assistant principals and superintendents.~    ~    ~      19~      Although the findings and prior opinions in this case include no express  conclusion of law that public school officials act within the scope of their  duties when they represent their institutions, no other view would be rational,  the official nature of their involvement being shown in any number of ways.  Interscholastic athletics obviously play an integral part in the public  education of Tennessee, where nearly every public high school spends money on  competitions among schools. Since a pickup system of interscholastic games would  not do, these public teams need some mechanism to produce rules and regulate  competition. The mechanism is an organization overwhelmingly composed of public  school officials who select representatives (all of them public officials at the  time in question here), who in turn adopt and enforce the rules that make the  system work. Thus, by giving these jobs to the Association, the 290 public  schools of Tennessee belonging to it can sensibly be seen as exercising their  own authority to meet their own responsibilities. Unsurprisingly, then, the  record indicates that half the council or board meetings documented here were  held during official school hours, and that public schools have largely provided  for the Association's financial support. A small portion of the Association's  revenue comes from membership dues paid by the schools, and the principal part  from gate receipts at tournaments among the member schools. Unlike mere public  buyers of contract services, whose payments for services rendered do not convert  the service providers into public actors, see Rendell-Baker, 457 U.S., at  839-843, the schools here obtain membership in the service organization and give  up sources of their own income to their collective association. The Association  thus exercises the authority of the predominantly public schools to charge for  admission to their games; the Association does not receive this money from the  schools, but enjoys the schools' moneymaking capacity as its own.~    ~    ~      20~      In sum, to the extent of 84% of its membership, the Association is an  organization of public schools represented by their officials acting in their  official capacity to provide an integral element of secondary public schooling.  There would be no recognizable Association, legal or tangible, without the  public school officials, who do not merely control but overwhelmingly perform  all but the purely ministerial acts by which the Association exists and  functions in practical terms. Only the 16% minority of private school  memberships prevents this entwinement of the Association and the public school  system from being total and their identities totally indistinguishable.~    ~    ~      21~      To complement the entwinement of public school officials with the  Association from the bottom up, the State of Tennessee has provided for  entwinement from top down. State Board members are assigned ex officio to serve  as members of the board of control and legislative council, and the  Association's ministerial employees are treated as state employees to the extent  of being eligible for membership in the state retirement system.~    ~    ~      22~      It is, of course, true that the time is long past when the close  relationship between the surrogate association and its public members and public  officials acting as such was attested frankly. As mentioned, the terms of the  State Board's Rule expressly designating the Association as regulator of  interscholastic athletics in public schools was deleted in 1996, the year after  a Federal District Court held that the Association was a state actor because its  rules were \"caused, directed and controlled by the Tennessee Board of  Education,\" Graham v. TSSAA, No. 1:95-CV-044, 1995 WL 115890, *5 (ED Tenn., Feb.  20, 1995).3~    ~    ~      23~      But the removal of the designation language from Rule 0520-1-2-.08 affected  nothing but words. Today the State Board's member-designees continue to sit on  the Association's committees as nonvoting members, and the State continues to  welcome Association employees in its retirement scheme. The close relationship  is confirmed by the Association's enforcement of the same preamendment rules and  regulations reviewed and approved by the State Board (including the recruiting  Rule challenged by Brentwood), and by the State Board's continued willingness to  allow students to satisfy its physical education requirement by taking part in  interscholastic athletics sponsored by the Association. The most one can say on  the evidence is that the State Board once freely acknowledged the Association's  official character but now does it by winks and nods.4 The amendment to the Rule  in 1996 affected candor but not the \"momentum\" of the Association's prior  involvement with the State Board. Evans v. Newton, 382 U.S., at 301. The  District Court spoke to this point in finding that because of \"custom and  practice,\" \"the conduct of the parties has not materially changed\" since 1996,  \"the connections between TSSAA and the State [being] still pervasive and  entwined.\" 13 F. Supp. 2d, at 681.~    ~    ~      24~      The entwinement down from the State Board is therefore unmistakable, just as  the entwinement up from the member public schools is overwhelming. Entwinement  will support a conclusion that an ostensibly private organization ought to be  charged with a public character and judged by constitutional standards;  entwinement to the degree shown here requires it.~    ~    C~    ~      25~      Entwinement is also the answer to the Association's several arguments  offered to persuade us that the facts would not support a finding of state  action under various criteria applied in other cases. These arguments are beside  the point, simply because the facts justify a conclusion of state action under  the criterion of entwinement, a conclusion in no sense unsettled merely because  other criteria of state action may not be satisfied by the same facts.~    ~    ~      26~      The Association places great stress, for example, on the application of a  public function test, as exemplified in Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U.S. 830  (1982). There, an apparently private school provided education for students  whose special needs made it difficult for them to finish high school. The  record, however, failed to show any tradition of providing public special  education to students unable to cope with a regular school, who had historically  been cared for (or ignored) according to private choice. It was true that  various public school districts had adopted the practice of referring students  to the school and paying their tuition, and no one disputed that providing the  instruction aimed at a proper public objective and conferred a public benefit.  But we held that the performance of such a public function did not permit a  finding of state action on the part of the school unless the function performed  was exclusively and traditionally public, as it was not in that case. The  Association argues that application of the public function criterion would  produce the same result here, and we will assume, arguendo, that it would. But  this case does not turn on a public function test, any more than Rendell-Baker  had anything to do with entwinement of public officials in the special school.~    ~    ~      27~      For the same reason, it avails the Association nothing to stress that the  State neither coerced nor encouraged the actions complained of. \"Coercion\" and  \"encouragement\" are like \"entwinement\" in referring to kinds of facts that can  justify characterizing an ostensibly private action as public instead. Facts  that address any of these criteria are significant, but no one criterion must  necessarily be applied. When, therefore, the relevant facts show pervasive  entwinement to the point of largely overlapping identity, the implication of  state action is not affected by pointing out that the facts might not loom large  under a different test.~    ~    D~    ~      28~      This is not to say that all of the Association's arguments are rendered  beside the point by the public officials' involvement in the Association, for  after application of the entwinement criterion, or any other, there is a further  potential issue, and the Association raises it. Even facts that suffice to show  public action (or, standing alone, would require such a finding) may be  outweighed in the name of some value at odds with finding public accountability  in the circumstances. In Polk County, 454 U.S., at 322, a defense lawyer's  actions were deemed private even though she was employed by the county and was  acting within the scope of her duty as a public defender. Full-time public  employment would be conclusive of state action for some purposes, see West v.

The state-action doctrine does not convert  opponents into virtual agents.~    ~    ~      29~      The assertion of such a countervailing value is the nub of each of the  Association's two remaining arguments, neither of which, however, persuades us.  The Association suggests, first, that reversing the judgment here will somehow  trigger an epidemic of unprecedented federal litigation. Brief for Respondents  35. Even if that might be counted as a good reason for a Polk County decision to  call the Association's action private, the record raises no reason for alarm  here. Save for the Sixth Circuit, every Court of Appeals to consider a statewide  athletic association like the one here has found it a state actor. This majority  view began taking shape even before Tarkanian, which cited two such decisions  approvingly, see supra, at 9, (and this was six years after Blum, Rendell-Baker,  and Lugar, on which the Sixth Circuit relied here). No one, however, has pointed  to any explosion of 1983 cases against interscholastic athletic associations in  the affected jurisdictions. Not to put too fine a point on it, two District  Courts in Tennessee have previously held the Association itself to be a state  actor, see Graham, 1995 WL 115890, at *5; Crocker v. Tennessee Secondary School  Athletic Assn., 735 F. Supp. 753 (MD Tenn. 1990), affirmance order, 908 F.2d  972, 973 (CA6 1990), but there is no evident wave of litigation working its way  across the State. A reversal of the judgment here portends nothing more than the  harmony of an outlying Circuit with precedent otherwise uniform.~    ~    ~      30~      Nor do we think there is anything to be said for the Association's  contention that there is no need to treat it as a state actor since any public  school applying the Association's rules is itself subject to suit under 1983 or  Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373, 20 U.S.C.   1681-1688. Brief for Respondents 30. If Brentwood's claim were pushing at the  edge of the class of possible defendant state actors, an argument about the  social utility of expanding that class would at least be on point, but because  we are nowhere near the margin in this case, the Association is really asking  for nothing less than a dispensation for itself. Its position boils down to  saying that the Association should not be dressed in state clothes because  other, concededly public actors are; that Brentwood should be kept out of court  because a different plaintiff raising a different claim in a different case may  find the courthouse open. Pleas for special treatment are hard to sell, although  saying that does not, of course, imply anything about the merits of Brentwood's  complaint; the issue here is merely whether Brentwood properly names the  Association as a 1983 defendant, not whether it should win on its claim.~    ~    ~      31~      The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and  the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~          A number of other courts have held statewide athletic associations to be  state actors. Griffin High School v.

Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 935 (1982).~      ~      ~        3~          The District Court in Graham held that \"[t]his delegation of authority to  TSSAA by Tennessee, standing alone, is sufficient to make TSSAA a state actor\"  under the \"state compulsion test,\" which it understood to provide that a State  could exercise such coercive power or provide such significant encouragement,  either overt or covert, that the choice of the private actor must be deemed to  be that of the State as a matter of law. 1995 WL 115890, at *4-*5 (citing Blum  v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 1004 (1982)).~      ~      ~        4~          The significance of winks and nods in state-action doctrine seems to be one  of the points of the dissenters' departure from the rest of the Court. In  drawing the public-private action line, the dissenters would emphasize the  formal clarity of the legislative action providing for the appointment of Gerard  College's trustees, see supra, at ___, post, at ___, in preference to our  reliance on the practical certainty in this case that public officials will  control operation of the Association under its bylaws. Similarly, the dissenters  stress the express formality of the special statute defining Amtrak's ties to  the Government, see supra, at ___, post, at ___, in contrast to the reality in  this case that the Association's organizers structured the Association's  relationships to the officialdom of public education. But if formalism were the  sine qua non of state action, the doctrine would vanish owing to the ease and  inevitability of its evasion, and for just that reason formalism has never been  controlling. For example, a criterion of state action like symbiosis (which the  dissenters accept, post, at ___ ) looks not to form but to an underlying  reality.~      ~    ~    ~      32~      Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice  Kennedy join, dissenting.~    ~    ~      33~      We have never found state action based upon mere \"entwinement.\" Until today,  we have found a private organization's acts to constitute state action only when  the organization performed a public function; was created, coerced, or  encouraged by the government; or acted in a symbiotic relationship with the  government. The majority's holding-that the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic  Association's (TSSAA) enforcement of its recruiting rule is state action-not  only extends state-action doctrine beyond its permissible limits but also  encroaches upon the realm of individual freedom that the doctrine was meant to  protect. I respectfully dissent.~    ~    ~      34~      * Like the state-action requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment, the  state-action element of 42 U.S.C.  1983 excludes from its coverage \"merely  private conduct, however discriminatory or wrongful.\" American Mfrs. Mut. Ins.  Co. v. Sullivan, 526 U.S. 40, 50 (1999) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \"Careful adherence to the 'state action' requirement\" thus \"preserves an area of  individual freedom by limiting the reach of federal law and federal judicial  power.\" Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 936 (1982). The state-action  doctrine also promotes important values of federalism, \"avoid[ing] the  imposition of responsibility on a State for conduct it could not control.\"  National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Tarkanian, 488 U.S. 179, 191 (1988).  Although we have used many different tests to identify state action, they all  have a common purpose. Our goal in every case is to determine whether an action  \"can fairly be attributed to the State.\" Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 1004  (1982); American Mfrs., supra, at 52.~    ~    ~      35~      * Regardless of these various tests for state action, common sense dictates  that the TSSAA's actions cannot fairly be attributed to the State, and thus  cannot constitute state action. The TSSAA was formed in 1925 as a private  corporation to organize interscholastic athletics and to sponsor tournaments  among its member schools. Any private or public secondary school may join the  TSSAA by signing a contract agreeing to comply with its rules and decisions.  Although public schools currently compose 84% of the TSSAA's membership, the  TSSAA does not require that public schools constitute a set percentage of its  membership, and, indeed, no public school need join the TSSAA. The TSSAA's rules  are enforced not by a state agency but by its own board of control, which  comprises high school principals, assistant principals, and superintendents,  none of whom must work at a public school. Of course, at the time the recruiting  rule was enforced in this case, all of the board members happened to be public  school officials. However, each board member acts in a representative capacity  on behalf of all the private and public schools in his region of Tennessee, and  not simply his individual school.~    ~    ~      36~      The State of Tennessee did not create the TSSAA. The State does not fund the  TSSAA and does not pay its employees.1 In fact, only 4% of the TSSAA's revenue  comes from the dues paid by member schools; the bulk of its operating budget is  derived from gate receipts at tournaments it sponsors. The State does not permit  the TSSAA to use state-owned facilities for a discounted fee, and it does not  exempt the TSSAA from state taxation. No Tennessee law authorizes the State to  coordinate interscholastic athletics or empowers another entity to organize  interscholastic athletics on behalf of the State.2 The only state pronouncement  acknowledging the TSSAA's existence is a rule providing that the State Board of  Education permits public schools to maintain membership in the TSSAA if they so  choose.3       Moreover, the State of Tennessee has never had any involvement in the  particular action taken by the TSSAA in this case: the enforcement of the  TSSAA's recruiting rule prohibiting members from using \"undue influence\" on  students or their parents or guardians \"to secure or to retain a student for  athletic purposes.\" App. 115. There is no indication that the State has ever had  any interest in how schools choose to regulate recruiting.4 In fact, the TSSAA's  authority to enforce its recruiting rule arises solely from the voluntary  membership contract that each member school signs, agreeing to conduct its  athletics in accordance with the rules and decisions of the TSSAA.~    ~    B~    ~      37~      Even approaching the issue in terms of any of the Court's specific  state-action tests, the conclusion is the same: The TSSAA's enforcement of its  recruiting rule against Brentwood Academy is not state action. In applying these  tests, courts of course must place the burden of persuasion on the plaintiff,  not the defendant, because state action is an element of a 1983 claim. American  Mfrs., 526 U.S., at 49-50; West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988).~    ~    ~      38~      The TSSAA has not performed a function that has been \"traditionally  exclusively reserved to the State.\" Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U.S.  345, 352 (1974). The organization of interscholastic sports is neither a  traditional nor an exclusive public function of the States. Widespread  organization and administration of interscholastic contests by schools did not  begin until the 20th century. See M. Lee, A History of Physical Education and  Sports in the U.S. A. 73 (1983) (explaining that what little interscholastic  athletics there was in the 19th century \"came almost entirely in the closing  decade of the century and was largely pupil inspired, pupil controlled, and  pupil coached\"); id., at 68, 146 (stating that no control of high school sports  occurred until 1896, when a group of teachers in Wisconsin set up a committee to  control such contests, and pointing out that \"[i]t was several years before the  idea caught on in other states\"). Certainly, in Tennessee, the State did not  even show an interest in interscholastic athletics until 47 years after the  TSSAA had been in existence and had been orchestrating athletic contests  throughout the State. Even then, the State Board of Education merely acquiesced  in the TSSAA's actions and did not assume the role of regulating interscholastic  athletics. Cf. Blum, 457 U.S., at 1004-1005 (\"Mere approval of or acquiescence  in the initiatives of a private party is not sufficient to justify holding the  State responsible for those initiatives . . .\"); see also Flagg Bros., Inc. v.  Brooks, 436 U.S. 149, 164-165 (1978). The TSSAA no doubt serves the public,  particularly the public schools, but the mere provision of a service to the  public does not render such provision a traditional and exclusive public  function. See Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U.S. 830, 842 (1982).~    ~    ~      39~      It is also obvious that the TSSAA is not an entity created and controlled by  the government for the purpose of fulfilling a government objective, as was  Amtrak in Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U.S. 374, 394  (1995). See also Pennsylvania v. Board of Directors of City Trusts of  Philadelphia, 353 U.S. 230 (1957) (per curiam) (holding that a state agency  created under state law was a state actor). Indeed, no one claims that the State  of Tennessee played any role in the creation of the TSSAA as a private  corporation in 1925. The TSSAA was designed to fulfill an objective-the  organization of interscholastic athletic tournaments-that the government had not  contemplated, much less pursued. And although the board of control currently is  composed of public school officials, and although public schools currently  account for the majority of the TSSAA's membership, this is not required by the  TSSAA's constitution.~    ~    ~      40~      In addition, the State of Tennessee has not \"exercised coercive power or . .  . provided such significant encouragement [to the TSSAA], either overt or  covert,\" Blum, 457 U.S., at 1004, that the TSSAA's regulatory activities must in  law be deemed to be those of the State. The State has not promulgated any  regulations of interscholastic sports, and nothing in the record suggests that  the State has encouraged or coerced the TSSAA in enforcing its recruiting rule.  To be sure, public schools do provide a small portion of the TSSAA's funding  through their membership dues, but no one argues that these dues are somehow  conditioned on the TSSAA's enactment and enforcement of recruiting rules.5  Likewise, even if the TSSAA were dependent on state funding to the extent of  90%, as was the case in Blum, instead of less than 4%, mere financial dependence  on the State does not convert the TSSAA's actions into acts of the State. See  Blum, supra, at 1011; Rendell-Baker, supra, at 840; see also Moose Lodge No. 107  v. Irvis, 407 U.S. 163, 173 (1972) (\"The Court has never held, of course, that  discrimination by an otherwise private entity would be violative of the Equal  Protection Clause if the private entity receives any sort of benefit or service  at all from the State . . .\"). Furthermore, there is no evidence of \"joint  participation,\" Lugar, 457 U.S., at 941-942, between the State and the TSSAA in  the TSSAA's enforcement of its recruiting rule. The TSSAA's board of control  enforces its recruiting rule solely in accordance with the authority granted to  it under the contract that each member signs.~    ~    ~      41~      Finally, there is no \"symbiotic relationship\" between the State and the  TSSAA. Moose Lodge, supra, at 175; cf. Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority,  365 U.S. 715 (1961). Contrary to the majority's assertion, see ante, at 10-11,  the TSSAA's \"fiscal relationship with the State is not different from that of  many contractors performing services for the government.\" Rendell-Baker, supra,  at 843. The TSSAA provides a service-the organization of athletic tournaments-in  exchange for membership dues and gate fees, just as a vendor could contract with  public schools to sell refreshments at school events. Certainly the public  school could sell its own refreshments, yet the existence of that option does  not transform the service performed by the contractor into a state action. Also,  there is no suggestion in this case that, as was the case in Burton, the State  profits from the TSSAA's decision to enforce its recruiting rule.~    ~    ~      42~      Because I do not believe that the TSSAA's action of enforcing its recruiting  rule is fairly attributable to the State of Tennessee, I would affirm.~    ~    II~    ~      43~      Although the TSSAA's enforcement activities cannot be considered state  action as a matter of common sense or under any of this Court's existing  theories of state action, the majority presents a new theory. Under this theory,  the majority holds that the combination of factors it identifies evidences  \"entwinement\" of the State with the TSSAA, and that such entwinement converts  private action into state action. Ante, at 7-8. The majority does not define  \"entwinement,\" and the meaning of the term is not altogether clear. But whatever  this new \"entwinement\" theory may entail, it lacks any support in our  state-action jurisprudence. Although the majority asserts that there are three  examples of entwinement analysis in our cases, there is no case in which we have  rested a finding of state action on entwinement alone.~    ~    ~      44~      Two of the cases on which the majority relies do not even use the word  \"entwinement.\" See Lebron, supra, at 374; City Trusts, supra, at 230. Lebron  concerned the status of Amtrak, a corporation that Congress created and placed  under Government control for the specific purpose of achieving a governmental  objective (namely to avert the threatened extinction of passenger train service  in the United States). 513 U.S., at 383, 386. Without discussing any notion of  entwinement, we simply held that, when \"the Government creates a corporation by  special law, for the furtherance of governmental objectives, and retains for  itself permanent authority to appoint a majority of the directors of that  corporation, the corporation is part of the Government for purposes of the First  Amendment.\" Id., at 400. Similarly, in City Trusts, we did not consider  entwinement when we addressed the question whether an agency established by  state law was a state actor. See 353 U.S., at 231. In that case, the  Pennsylvania legislature passed a law creating a board of directors to operate a  racially segregated school for orphans. Ibid. Without mentioning \"entwinement,\"  we held that, because the board was a state agency, its actions were  attributable to the State. Ibid.~    ~    ~      45~      The majority's third example, Evans v. Newton, 382 U.S. 296 (1966), lends no  more support to an \"entwinement\" theory than do Lebron and City Trusts. Although  Evans at least uses the word \"entwined,\" 382 U.S., at 299 (\"Conduct that is  formally 'private' may become so entwined with governmental policies or so  impregnated with a governmental character as to become subject to the  constitutional limitations placed upon state action\"), we did not discuss  entwinement as a distinct concept, let alone one sufficient to transform a  private entity into a state actor when traditional theories of state action do  not. On the contrary, our analysis rested on the recognition that the subject of  the dispute, a park, served a \"public function,\" much like a fire department or  a police department. Id., at 302. A park, we noted, is a \"public facility\" that  \"serves the community.\" Id., at 301-302. Even if the city severed all ties to  the park and placed its operation in private hands, the park still would be  \"municipal in nature,\" analogous to other public facilities that have given rise  to a finding of state action: the streets of a company town in Marsh v. Alabama,  326 U.S. 501 (1946), the elective process in Terry v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461  (1953), and the transit system in Public Utilities Comm'n of D. C. v. Pollak,  343 U.S. 451 (1952). 382 U.S., at 301-302. Because the park served public  functions, the private trustees operating the park were considered to be state  actors.6~    ~    ~      46~      These cases, therefore, cannot support the majority's \"entwinement\" theory.  Only Evans speaks of entwinement at all, and it does not do so in the same broad  sense as does the majority.7 Moreover, these cases do not suggest that the  TSSAA's activities can be considered state action, whether the label for the  state-action theory is \"entwinement\" or anything else.~    ~    ~      47~      *        *        *~    ~    ~      48~      Because the majority never defines \"entwinement,\" the scope of its holding  is unclear. If we are fortunate, the majority's fact-specific analysis will have  little bearing beyond this case. But if the majority's new entwinement test  develops in future years, it could affect many organizations that foster  activities, enforce rules, and sponsor extracurricular competition among high  schools-not just in athletics, but in such diverse areas as agriculture,  mathematics, music, marching bands, forensics, and cheerleading. Indeed, this  entwinement test may extend to other organizations that are composed of, or  controlled by, public officials or public entities, such as firefighters,  policemen, teachers, cities, or counties. I am not prepared to say that any  private organization that permits public entities and public officials to  participate acts as the State in anything or everything it does, and our  state-action jurisprudence has never reached that far. The state-action doctrine  was developed to reach only those actions that are truly attributable to the  State, not to subject private citizens to the control of federal courts hearing  1983 actions.~    ~    ~      49~      I respectfully dissent.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~          Although the TSSAA's employees, who typically are retired teachers, are  allowed to participate in the state retirement system, the State does not pay  any portion of the employer contribution for them. The TSSAA is one of three  private associations, along with the Tennessee Education Association and the  Tennessee School Boards Association, whose employees are statutorily permitted  to participate in the state retirement system. Tenn. Code Ann. 8-35-118 (1993).~      ~      ~        2~          The first formal state acknowledgement of the TSSAA's existence did not  occur until 1972, when the State Board of Education passed a resolution stating  that it \"recognizes and designates [the TSSAA] as the organization to supervise  and regulate the athletic activities in which the public junior and senior high  schools of Tennessee participate in on an interscholastic basis.\" App. 211.  There is no indication that the TSSAA invited this resolution or that the  resolution in any way altered the actions of the TSSAA or the State following  its adoption in 1972. In fact, it appears that the resolution was not entirely  accurate: The TSSAA does not supervise or regulate regular season  interscholastic contests. In any event, the resolution was revoked in 1996.  Contrary to the majority's reference to its revocation as being \"winks and  nods,\" ante, at 12, the repeal of the 1972 resolution appears to have had no  more impact on the TSSAA's operation than did its passage.~        The majority also  cites this resolution to support its assertion that \"[e]ver since the  Association was incorporated in 1925, Tennessee's State Board of Education . . .  has acknowledged the corporation's function 'in providing standards, rules and  regulations for interscholastic competition in the public schools of Tennessee.'  \" Ante, at 3. However, there is no evidence in the record that suggests that the  State of Tennessee or the State Board of Education had any involvement or  interest in the TSSAA prior to 1972.~      ~      ~        3~          The rule provides: \"The State Board of Education recognizes the value of  participation in interscholastic athletics and the role of the Tennessee  Secondary School Athletic Association in coordinating interscholastic athletic  competition. The State Board of Education authorizes the public schools of the  state to voluntarily maintain membership in the Tennessee Secondary School  Athletic Association.\" Tenn. Comp. Rules  Regs. 0520-1-2-.08(1) (2000).~      ~      ~        4~          The majority relies on the fact that the TSSAA permits members of the State  Board of Education to serve ex officio on its board of control to support its  \"top-down\" theory of state action. But these members are not voting members of  the TSSAA's board of control and thus cannot exert any control over its actions.~      ~      ~        5~          The majority emphasizes that public schools joining the TSSAA \"give up  sources of their own income to their collective association\" by allowing the  TSSAA \"to charge for admission to their games.\" Ante, at 10-11. However, this  would be equally true whenever a State contracted with a private entity: The  State presumably could provide the same service for profit, if it so chose. In  Rendellnbhyph;Baker v. Kohn, 457 U.S. 830 (1982), for example, the State could  have created its own school for students with special needs and charged for  admission. Or in Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991 (1982), the State could have  created its own nursing homes and charged individuals to stay there. The ability  of a State to make money by performing a service it has chosen to buy from a  private entity is hardly an indication that the service provider is a state  actor.~      ~      ~        6~          We have used the word \"entwined\" in another case, Gilmore v. Montgomery, 417  U.S. 556, 565 (1974), which the majority does not cite. In Gilmore, we held that  a city could not grant exclusive use of public facilities to racially segregated  groups. Id., at 566. The city, we determined, was \"engaged in an elaborate  subterfuge\" to circumvent a court order desegregating the city's recreational  facilities. Id., at 567. The grant of exclusive authority was little different  from a formal agreement to run a segregated recreational program. Ibid. Thus,  although we quoted the \"entwined\" language from Evans v. Newton, 382 U.S. 296  (1966), we were not using the term in the same loose sense the majority uses it  today. And there is certainly no suggestion that the TSSAA has structured its  recruiting rule specifically to evade review of an activity that previously was  deemed to be unconstitutional state action.~      ~      ~        7~          The majority's reference to National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Tarkanian,  488 U.S. 179 (1988), as foreshadowing this case, ante, at 8, also does not  support its conclusion. Indeed, the reference to Tarkanian is ironic because it  is not difficult to imagine that application of the majority's entwinement test  could change the result reached in that case, so that the National Collegiate  Athletic Association's actions could be found to be state action given its large  number of public institution members that virtually control the organization.~      ~    ~    ",

In 1996, CoBank filed amended returns on behalf of that bank, requesting an  exemption from all Missouri corporate income taxes and refunds on the taxes it  paid for 1991 through 1994. CoBank asserted that the Supremacy Clause accords  federal instrumentalities immunity from state taxation unless Congress has  expressly waived this immunity, and that, because the Act's current version does  not expressly do so, banks for cooperatives are exempt from Missouri's corporate  income tax. The State denied the request, but the State Supreme Court reversed,  stating that because the Act's current version is silent as to such banks' tax  immunity, Congress cannot be said to have expressly consented to state income  taxation  and, thus, the banks are exempt.~      Held: Banks for cooperatives are subject to state income taxation. Pp. 5-9.~      (a) Congress has provided that banks for cooperatives are subject to state  taxation. The 1933 Act subjected such banks to state taxation except when the  Unites States held stock in the banks. As soon as governmental investment in the  banks was repaid (as it was by 1968), the banks had to pay state income taxes  because the exemption from such taxation no longer applied. Congress did not  change that rule when it amended the Act in 1971. Nor did various 1985  amendments-which discontinued the Government's authority to own stock in banks  for cooperatives and deleted the two sentences within 12 U.S.C.  2134 that  exempted such a bank from state taxation when the Government held stock in the  bank-expressly change the taxation of banks for cooperatives. And, it would be  surprising, indeed, if Congress had eliminated the States' ability to collect  revenue from the banks sub silentio. The more logical interpretation, and one  that accords with the Act's more than 50-year history, is that Congress merely  deleted language in 2134 that had become superfluous once the United States no  longer owned, and no longer could own, stock in banks for cooperatives. Pp. 5-8.~      (b) The Act's structure confirms that banks for cooperatives are subject to  state taxation. With respect to each lending institution in the Farm Credit  System, the Act contains a taxation provision that specifically delineates that  entity's tax immunity. Banks for cooperatives have been granted only limited tax  exemptions. Had Congress intended to confer upon them the more comprehensive  exemption it provided for other types of institutions, it would have done so  expressly. Pp. 8-9.~      10 S. W. 3d 142, reversed and remanded.~      CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MISSOURI~      Thomas, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.~      Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    Opinion of the Court~    ~      1~      In this case we are asked to decide whether the National Bank for  Cooperatives, which Congress has designated as a federally chartered  instrumentality of the United States, is exempt from state income taxation. We  hold that it is not.~    ~    ~      2~      * In the Farm Credit Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 257, as amended, 12 U.S.C.  2001  et seq., Congress created various lending institutions within the Farm Credit  System to meet the specific credit needs of farmers. Among these institutions  were banks for cooperatives, one in each of 12 farm credit districts, and a  Central Bank for Cooperatives. These banks were designed to make loans to cooperative associations engaged in marketing farm products, purchasing farm  supplies, or furnishing farm services.~    ~    ~      3~      Today, the Farm Credit System includes banks for cooperatives, production  credit associations, farm credit banks, and federal land bank associations.  2002(a). By statute, each of these institutions is designated as a \"federally  chartered instrumentalit[y] of the United States.\" 2121 (banks for cooperatives  and Central Bank for Cooperatives); 2141 (National Bank for Cooperatives);  2071(a) and (b)(7) (production credit associations); 2011(a) (farm credit  banks); 2091(a) and (b)(4) (federal land bank associations). The Farm Credit  Act also addresses the taxation of these institutions. The provision applicable  to a bank for cooperatives, the institution at issue in this case, states:~    ~    ~      4~      \"Each bank for cooperatives and its obligations are instrumentalities of the  United States and as such any and all notes, debentures, and other obligations  issued by such bank shall be exempt, both as to principal and interest from all  taxation (except surtaxes, estate, inheritance, and gift taxes) now or hereafter  imposed by the United States or any State, territorial, or local taxing  authority, except that interest on such obligations shall be subject to Federal  income taxation in the hands of the holder.\" 2134.~    ~    ~      5~      Respondent CoBank ACB is the successor to all rights and obligations of the  National Bank for Cooperatives, which had been formed in 1989 through the  consolidation of 10 district banks for cooperatives and the Central Bank for  Cooperatives.1 The National Bank for Cooperatives filed Missouri corporate  income tax returns for the years 1991 through 1994 and paid the taxes shown on  those returns. In March 1996, CoBank filed amended returns on behalf of the  National Bank for Cooperatives, requesting an exemption from all state income  taxes and refunds on the taxes paid-erroneously, it alleged-for 1991 through  1994. Relying on the doctrine of implied tax immunity that originated in  McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), CoBank asserted that the Supremacy  Clause of the Constitution accords federal instrumentalities immunity from state  taxation unless Congress has expressly waived this immunity. CoBank argued that,  because the current version of the Farm Credit Act does not expressly waive this  immunity, banks for cooperatives are exempt from Missouri's corporate income  tax. The Director of Revenue of Missouri denied the request.~    ~    ~      6~      On appeal, the Administrative Hearing Commission upheld the Director of  Revenue's assessment of corporate income tax, because the National Bank for  Cooperatives had not established that it was a federal instrumentality  statutorily exempt from state taxation of its income. The commission determined  that Congress did not provide expressly that banks for cooperatives, in contrast  to farm credit banks and federal land bank associations, would have immunity  from state income taxation. The commission reasoned that had Congress intended  to confer upon banks for cooperatives the same immunity that was provided to  farm credit banks and federal land bank associations, it would have done so  expressly. For jurisdictional reasons, the commission did not decide CoBank's  constitutional claim.~    ~    ~      7~      The Missouri Supreme Court reversed the commission's decision and held that  banks for cooperatives are exempt from state income taxation.2 Production Credit  Assn. of Southeastern Mo. v. Director of Revenue, 10 S. W. 3d 142, 143 (2000).  The Missouri Supreme Court held that the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution  provides federal instrumentalities immunity from state taxation unless Congress  has expressly waived this immunity. According to the Missouri Supreme Court,  because the current version of the Farm Credit Act is silent as to such  institutions' immunity from state taxation, Congress cannot be said to have  expressly consented to state income taxation and, thus, the institutions are  exempt from state income taxes. The Missouri Supreme Court noted that other  courts that had addressed the issue of state taxation of member institutions of  the Farm Credit System also had concluded that the States could not tax such  institutions.

App. 11/5/99), 746 So. 2d 280).~    ~    ~      8~      The New Mexico Court of Appeals and the Indiana Supreme Court have reached  the opposite conclusion with respect to state taxation of production credit  associations. See Production Credit Assn. of Eastern N. M. v. Taxation and  Revenue Dept., 2000 NMCA-021 26, 999 P.2d 1031, 1038, cert. denied, 997 P.2d  820 (N. M. 2000); Indiana Dept. of State Revenue v. Farm Credit Servs. of  Mid-America, ACA, 734 N. E. 2d 551, 560 (Ind. 2000). Since the statutory history  and provisions regarding the taxation of production credit associations and  banks for cooperatives are virtually identical, compare 12 U.S.C.  2077 with  2134; compare Farm Credit Act of 1971, 2.17, 85 Stat. 602, with 3.13, 85  Stat. 608; compare Farm Credit Amendments Act of 1985, 205(d)(16), 99 Stat.  1705, with 205(e)(10), 99 Stat. 1705,3 we granted certiorari to resolve this  conflict. 530 U.S. 1260 (2000).~    ~    II~    ~      9~      Congress has expressly designated banks for cooperatives as  \"instrumentalities of the United States.\" 12 U.S.C.  2121. We have held, in  addressing state taxation of contractors conducting business with the United  States, that an instrumentality is entitled to implied tax immunity only when it  is \"so closely connected to the Government that the two cannot realistically be  viewed as separate entities.\" United States v. New Mexico, 455 U.S. 720, 735  (1982). Relying on New Mexico, the Director of Revenue argues that banks for  cooperatives are not \"so closely connected\" to the United States as to be  indistinguishable from the United States, and that banks for cooperatives thus  are not entitled to immunity from state taxation. CoBank disagrees with this  characterization and asks us to conclude that banks for cooperatives are indeed  virtual arms of the United States, worthy of implied tax immunity under  McCulloch.~    ~    ~      10~      We need not, however, reach this implied immunity question. Implied immunity  becomes an issue only when Congress has failed to indicate whether an  instrumentality is subject to state taxation. In this case, Congress has  provided that banks for cooperatives are subject to state taxation. To be sure,  Congress did not include an express statement in the current version of 2134.  However, nothing in the statute indicates a repeal of the previous express  approval of state taxation, and the structure of the Farm Credit Act indicates  by negative implication that banks for cooperatives are not entitled to  immunity.~    ~    ~      11~      * Upon their creation in 1933, banks for cooperatives were subject to state  income taxation except during periods when the United States held stock in the  banks. Farm Credit Act of 1933, 63, 48 Stat. 267 (\"Such banks, ... and their  income, shall be exempt from all taxation now or hereafter imposed by the United  States or by any State, Territorial, or local taxing authority ... . The exemption  provided herein shall not apply ... with respect to ... any ... Bank for Cooperatives,  or its property or income after the stock held in it by the United States has  been retired\"). Under this statute, as soon as governmental investment in a bank  for cooperatives was repaid (as it was for all such banks by 1968), the bank had  to pay state income taxes because the exemption from such taxation no longer  applied.~    ~    ~      12~      When Congress amended the Farm Credit Act in 1971, it did not change the  rule that banks for cooperatives are subject to state taxation unless the United  States holds stock in the banks. Farm Credit Act of 1971, 3.13, 85 Stat. 608.  Although all banks for cooperatives were at the time privately owned, Congress  provided that the Governor of the Farm Credit Administration had the authority  on behalf of the United States to purchase stock in banks for cooperatives \"as a  temporary investment in the stock of the institution to help one or several of  the banks ... to meet emergency credit needs of borrowers.\" 4.0, 85 Stat. 609.  The 1971 version of 2134 therefore provided, in relevant part:~    ~    ~      13~      \"Such banks ... and their income shall be exempt from all taxation now or  hereafter imposed by the United States or by any State, territorial, or local  taxing authority ... . The exemption provided in the preceding sentence shall  apply only for any year or part thereof in which stock in the bank for  cooperatives is held by the Governor of the Farm Credit Administration.\"~    ~    ~      14~      3.13,  85 Stat. 608-609.~    ~    ~      15~      In 1985, Congress enacted various amendments to the Act. Among other things,  these amendments eliminated the position of Governor of the Farm Credit  Administration, discontinued the Farm Credit Administration's authority to own  stock in banks for cooperatives, and included numerous \"Technical and Conforming  Amendments.\" Farm Credit Amendments Act of 1985, 201, 99 Stat. 1688; 101, 99  Stat. 1678; 205, 99 Stat. 1703-1707. One of these technical and conforming  amendments was the deletion of the two sentences within 2134 that, first,  exempted a bank for cooperatives from state taxation and, second, limited that  exemption to periods when the Governor held stock in the bank. 205(e)(10), 99  Stat. 1705, as amended, 12 U.S.C.  2134.~    ~    ~      16~      CoBank argues that the deletion of these two sentences altered the States'  ability to tax the income of banks for cooperatives. According to CoBank,  because the deletion eliminated the express statutory authorization for such  taxation, Congress intended banks for cooperatives to be immune from state  taxation under McCulloch's implied immunity doctrine. We do not share CoBank's  interpretation as to the effect of this amendment, because there is no  indication that Congress intended to change the taxation of banks for  cooperatives with the 1985 amendments. Since 1933, the States could collect  revenue from banks for cooperatives. Nothing in the 1985 amendments expressly  changes this. And, it would be surprising, indeed, if Congress had eliminated  this important fact sub silentio.~    ~    ~      17~      CoBank's interpretation would mean that Congress made a radical-but entirely  implicit-change in the taxation of banks for cooperatives with the 1985  amendment to 2134. The amendment to 2134 was merely one of numerous \"technical  and conforming amendments\" to the Farm Credit Act. Farm Credit Amendments Act of  1985, 205, 99 Stat. 1703-1707 (section entitled \"Technical and Conforming  Amendments\"). In fact, the deletion of the sentence within 2134 referring to  the Governor was one of more than 30 deletions of references to the Governor, a  position eliminated by the 1985 amendments to the Act. Ibid. The more logical  interpretation of this amendment to 2134 is that Congress merely deleted  language that had become superfluous once the United States no longer owned, and  no longer could own, stock in banks for cooperatives. This explanation accords  with the more than 50-year history of the Farm Credit Act, permitting the States  to tax banks for cooperatives except when there was governmental investment in  the banks. Had Congress simply deleted the final sentence of 2134 that limited  the exemption while retaining the sentence granting the exemption, we would have  no trouble concluding that Congress had eliminated the States' ability to tax  banks for cooperatives. Short of this act, however, we find Congress' silence  insufficient to disrupt the 50-year history of state taxation of banks for  cooperatives.~    ~    B~    ~      18~      In addition, the structure of the Farm Credit Act confirms that banks for  cooperatives are subject to state taxation. With respect to each lending  institution in the Farm Credit System, the Act contains a taxation provision  that specifically delineates the immunity from taxation enjoyed by that entity.  For example, farm credit banks and federal land bank associations receive the  type of immunity from state taxation that the Missouri Supreme Court held to be  implied here for banks for cooperatives. See 12 U.S.C.  2023 (\"The Farm Credit  Banks and the capital, reserves, and surplus thereof, and the income derived  therefrom, shall be exempt from Federal, State, municipal, and local taxation  ...\"); 2098 (\"Each Federal land bank association and the capital, reserves, and  surplus thereof, and the income derived therefrom, shall be exempt from Federal,  State, municipal, and local taxation ...\").~    ~    ~      19~      By contrast, since their creation in 1933, banks for cooperatives have been  granted only limited exemptions from taxation. Had Congress intended to confer  upon banks for cooperatives the more comprehensive exemption from taxation that  it had provided to farm credit banks and federal land bank associations, it  would have done so expressly as it had done elsewhere in the Farm Credit Act.  Thus, in light of the structure of the Farm Credit Act-and the explicit grant of  immunity to other institutions within the Farm Credit System-Congress' silence  with respect to banks for cooperatives indicates that banks for cooperatives are  subject to state taxation.~    ~    ~      20~      ***~    ~    ~      21~      The judgment of the Missouri Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is  remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~          CoBank is an \"agricultural credit bank,\" which the Farm Credit  Administration recognizes as having the combined authority of a bank for  cooperatives and a farm credit bank.

Once  they did so, the officers found drug paraphernalia and marijuana, and arrested  McArthur. He was subsequently charged with misdemeanor possession of those  items. He moved to suppress the evidence on the ground that it was the \"fruit\"  of an unlawful police seizure, namely, the refusal to let him reenter his home  unaccompanied. The Illinois trial court granted the motion, and the State  Appellate Court affirmed.~      Held: Given the nature of the intrusion and the law enforcement interest at  stake, the brief seizure of the premises was permissible under the Fourth  Amendment. Pp. 3-10.~      (a) The Amendment's central requirement is one of reasonableness. Although,  in the ordinary case, personal property seizures are unreasonable unless  accomplished pursuant to a warrant, United States v. Place, 462 U.S. 696, 701,  there are exceptions to this rule involving special law enforcement needs,  diminished expectations of privacy, minimal intrusions, and the like, see, e.g.,  Pennsylvania v. Labron, 518 U.S. 938, 940-941. The circumstances here involve a  plausible claim of specially pressing or urgent law enforcement need. Cf., e.g.,  United States v. Place, supra, at 701. Moreover, the restraint at issue was  tailored to that need, being limited in time and scope, cf. Terry v. Ohio, 392  U.S. 1, 29-30, and avoiding significant intrusion into the home itself, cf.  Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 585. Consequently, rather than employing a per  se rule of unreasonableness, the Court must balance the privacy-related and law  enforcement-related concerns to determine if the intrusion here was reasonable.  Cf. Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 654. In light of the following  circumstances, considered in combination, the Court concludes that the  restriction was reasonable, and hence lawful. First, the police had probable  cause to believe that McArthur's home contained evidence of a crime and unlawful  drugs. Second, they had good reason to fear that, unless restrained, he would  destroy the drugs before they could return with a warrant. Third, they made  reasonable efforts to reconcile their law enforcement needs with the demands of  personal privacy by avoiding a warrantless entry or arrest and preventing  McArthur only from entering his home unaccompanied. Fourth, they imposed the  restraint for a limited period, which was no longer than reasonably necessary  for them, acting with diligence, to obtain the warrant. Pp. 3-6.~      (b) The conclusion that the restriction was lawful finds significant support  in this Court's case law. See, e.g., Segura v. United States, 468 U.S. 796;  United States v. Place, supra, at 706. And in no case has this Court held  unlawful a temporary seizure that was supported by probable cause and was  designed to prevent the loss of evidence while the police diligently obtained a  warrant in a reasonable period. But cf. Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U.S. 740, 754.  Pp. 6-7.~      (c) The Court is not persuaded by the countervailing considerations raised  by the parties or lower courts: that the police proceeded without probable  cause; that, because McArthur was on his porch, the police order that he stay  outside his home amounted to an impermissible \"constructive eviction\"; that an  officer, with McArthur's consent, stepped inside the home's doorway to observe  McArthur when McArthur reentered the home on two or three occasions; and that  Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U.S. 740, 742, 754, offers direct support for McArthur's  position. Pp. 7-10.~      304 Ill. App. 3d 395, 713 N. E. 2d 93, reversed and remanded.~      CERTIORARI TO THE APPELLATE COURT OF ILLINOIS, FOURTH DISTRICT~      Breyer, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J.,  and O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, and Ginsburg, JJ., joined.  Souter, J., filed a concurring opinion. Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      Police officers, with probable cause to believe that a man had hidden  marijuana in his home, prevented that man from entering the home for about two  hours while they obtained a search warrant. We must decide whether those  officers violated the Fourth Amendment. We conclude that the officers acted  reasonably. They did not violate the Amendment's requirements. And we reverse an  Illinois court's holding to the contrary.~    ~    ~      2~      * A~    ~    ~      3~      On April 2, 1997, Tera McArthur asked two police officers to accompany her  to the trailer where she lived with her husband, Charles, so that they could  keep the peace while she removed her belongings. The two officers, Assistant  Chief John Love and Officer Richard Skidis, arrived with Tera at the trailer at  about 3:15 p.m. Tera went inside, where Charles was present. The officers  remained outside.~    ~    ~      4~      When Tera emerged after collecting her possessions, she spoke to Chief Love,  who was then on the porch. She suggested he check the trailer because \"Chuck had  dope in there.\" App. 15. She added (in Love's words) that she had seen Chuck  \"slid[e] some dope underneath the couch.\" Id., at 19.~    ~    ~      5~      Love knocked on the trailer door, told Charles what Tera had said, and asked  for permission to search the trailer, which Charles denied. Love then sent  Officer Skidis with Tera to get a search warrant.~    ~    ~      6~      Love told Charles, who by this time was also on the porch, that he could not  reenter the trailer unless a police officer accompanied him. Charles  subsequently reentered the trailer two or three times (to get cigarettes and to  make phone calls), and each time Love stood just inside the door to observe what  Charles did.~    ~    ~      7~      Officer Skidis obtained the warrant by about 5 p.m. He returned to the  trailer and, along with other officers, searched it. The officers found under  the sofa a marijuana pipe, a box for marijuana (called a \"one-hitter\" box), and  a small amount of marijuana. They then arrested Charles.~    ~    B~    ~      8~      Illinois subsequently charged Charles McArthur with unlawfully possessing  drug paraphernalia and marijuana (less than 2.5 grams), both misdemeanors. See  Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, 550/4(a), 600/3.5(a) (1998). McArthur moved to  suppress the pipe, box, and marijuana on the ground that they were the \"fruit\"  of an unlawful police seizure, namely, the refusal to let him reenter the  trailer unaccompanied, which would have permitted him, he said, to \"have  destroyed the marijuana.\" App. 27.~    ~    ~      9~      The trial court granted McArthur's suppression motion. The Appellate Court  of Illinois affirmed, 304 Ill. App. 3d 395, 713 N. E. 2d 93 (1999), and the  Illinois Supreme Court denied the State's petition for leave to appeal, 185 Ill.  2d 651, 720 N. E. 2d 1101 (1999). We granted certiorari to determine whether the  Fourth Amendment prohibits the kind of temporary seizure at issue here.~    ~    II~    ~      10~      * The Fourth Amendment says that the \"right of the people to be secure in  their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and  seizures, shall not be violated.\" U.S. Const., Amdt. 4. Its \"central  requirement\" is one of reasonableness. See Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730, 739  (1983). In order to enforce that requirement, this Court has interpreted the  Amendment as establishing rules and presumptions designed to control conduct of  law enforcement officers that may significantly intrude upon privacy interests.  Sometimes those rules require warrants. We have said, for example, that in \"the  ordinary case,\" seizures of personal property are \"unreasonable within the  meaning of the Fourth Amendment,\" without more, \"unless . . . accomplished  pursuant to a judicial warrant,\" issued by a neutral magistrate after finding  probable cause. United States v. Place, 462 U.S. 696, 701 (1983).~    ~    ~      11~      We nonetheless have made it clear that there are exceptions to the warrant  requirement. When faced with special law enforcement needs, diminished  expectations of privacy, minimal intrusions, or the like, the Court has found  that certain general, or individual, circumstances may render a warrantless  search or seizure reasonable. See, e.g., Pennsylvania v. Labron, 518 U.S. 938,  940-941 (1996) (per curiam) (search of automobile supported by probable cause);  Michigan Dept. of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U.S. 444, 455 (1990) (suspicionless  stops at drunk driver checkpoint); United States v. Place, supra, at 706  (temporary seizure of luggage based on reasonable suspicion); Michigan v.  Summers, 452 U.S. 692, 702-705 (1981) (temporary detention of suspect without  arrest warrant to prevent flight and protect officers while executing search  warrant); Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 27 (1968) (temporary stop and limited  search for weapons based on reasonable suspicion).~    ~    ~      12~      In the circumstances of the case before us, we cannot say that the  warrantless seizure was per se unreasonable. It involves a plausible claim of  specially pressing or urgent law enforcement need, i.e., \"exigent  circumstances.\" Cf., e.g., United States v. Place, supra, at 701 (\"[T]he  exigencies of the circumstances\" may permit temporary seizure without warrant);  Warden, Md. Penitentiary v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294, 298-299 (1967) (warrantless  search for suspect and weapons reasonable where delay posed grave danger);  Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 770-771 (1966) (warrantless blood test  for alcohol reasonable where delay would have led to loss of evidence).  Moreover, the restraint at issue was tailored to that need, being limited in  time and scope, cf. Terry v. Ohio, supra, at 29-30, and avoiding significant  intrusion into the home itself, cf. Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 585 (1980)  (\" '[T]he chief evil against which the ... Fourth Amendment is directed' \" is  warrantless entry and search of home) (quoting United States v. United States  Dist. Court for Eastern Dist. of Mich., 407 U.S. 297, 313 (1972)). Consequently,  rather than employing a per se rule of unreasonableness, we balance the  privacy-related and law enforcement-related concerns to determine if the  intrusion was reasonable. Cf. Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 654 (1979)  (determining lawfulness by balancing privacy and law enforcement interests);  United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873, 878 (1975) (same).~    ~    ~      13~      We conclude that the restriction at issue was reasonable, and hence lawful,  in light of the following circumstances, which we consider in combination.  First, the police had probable cause to believe that McArthur's trailer home  contained evidence of a crime and contraband, namely, unlawful drugs. The police  had had an opportunity to speak with Tera McArthur and make at least a very  rough assessment of her reliability. They knew she had had a firsthand  opportunity to observe her husband's behavior, in particular with respect to the  drugs at issue. And they thought, with good reason, that her report to them  reflected that opportunity. Cf. Massachusetts v. Upton, 466 U.S. 727, 732-734  (1984) (per curiam) (upholding search warrant issued in similar circumstances).~    ~    ~      14~      Second, the police had good reason to fear that, unless restrained, McArthur  would destroy the drugs before they could return with a warrant. They reasonably  might have thought that McArthur realized that his wife knew about his marijuana  stash; observed that she was angry or frightened enough to ask the police to  accompany her; saw that after leaving the trailer she had spoken with the  police; and noticed that she had walked off with one policeman while leaving the  other outside to observe the trailer. They reasonably could have concluded that  McArthur, consequently suspecting an imminent search, would, if given the  chance, get rid of the drugs fast.~    ~    ~      15~      Third, the police made reasonable efforts to reconcile their law enforcement  needs with the demands of personal privacy. They neither searched the trailer  nor arrested McArthur before obtaining a warrant. Rather, they imposed a  significantly less restrictive restraint, preventing McArthur only from entering  the trailer unaccompanied. They left his home and his belongings intact-until a  neutral Magistrate, finding probable cause, issued a warrant.~    ~    ~      16~      Fourth, the police imposed the restraint for a limited period of time,  namely, two hours. Cf. Terry v. Ohio, supra, at 28 (manner in which police act  is \"vital ... part of ... inquiry\"). As far as the record reveals, this time period  was no longer than reasonably necessary for the police, acting with diligence,  to obtain the warrant. Compare United States v. Place, supra, at 709-710  (holding 90-minute detention of luggage unreasonable based on nature of  interference with person's travels and lack of diligence of police), with United  States v. Van Leeuwen, 397 U.S. 249, 253 (1970) (holding 29-hour detention of  mailed package reasonable given unavoidable delay in obtaining warrant and  minimal nature of intrusion). Given the nature of the intrusion and the law  enforcement interest at stake, this brief seizure of the premises was  permissible.~    ~    B~    ~      17~      Our conclusion that the restriction was lawful finds significant support in  this Court's case law. In Segura v. United States, 468 U.S. 796 (1984), the  Court considered the admissibility of drugs which the police had found in a  lawful, warrant-based search of an apartment, but only after unlawfully entering  the apartment and occupying it for 19 hours. The majority held that the drugs  were admissible because, had the police acted lawfully throughout, they could  have discovered and seized the drugs pursuant to the validly issued warrant. See  id., at 799, 814-815 (citing Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U.S.  385 (1920)). The minority disagreed. However, when describing alternative lawful  search and seizure methods, both majority and minority assumed, at least for  argument's sake, that the police, armed with reliable information that the  apartment contained drugs, might lawfully have sealed the apartment from the  outside, restricting entry into the apartment while waiting for the warrant.  Compare Segura v. United States, 468 U.S., at 814 (\"Had police never entered the  apartment, but instead conducted a perimeter stakeout to prevent anyone from  entering ... and destroying evidence, the contraband ... would have been ... seized  precisely as it was here\"), with id., at 824, n. 15 (Stevens, J., dissenting)  (\"I assume impoundment would be permissible even absent exigent circumstances  when it occurs 'from the outside'-when the authorities merely seal off premises  pending the issuance of a warrant but do not enter\"); see also Mincey v.  Arizona, 437 U.S. 385, 394 (1978) (exigent circumstances do not justify search  where police guard at door could prevent loss of evidence); United States v.  Jeffers, 342 U.S. 48, 52 (1951) (same).~    ~    ~      18~      In various other circumstances, this Court has upheld temporary restraints  where needed to preserve evidence until police could obtain a warrant. See,  e.g., United States v. Place, 462 U.S., at 706 (reasonable suspicion justifies  brief detention of luggage pending further investigation); United States v. Van  Leeuwen, supra, at 253 (reasonable suspicion justifies detaining package  delivered for mailing). Cf. Richards v. Wisconsin, 520 U.S. 385, 395 (1997) (no  need to \"knock and announce\" when executing a search warrant where officers  reasonably suspect that evidence might be destroyed); Carroll v. United States,  267 U.S. 132, 153 (1925) (warrantless search of automobile constitutionally  permissible).~    ~    ~      19~      We have found no case in which this Court has held unlawful a temporary  seizure that was supported by probable cause and was designed to prevent the  loss of evidence while the police diligently obtained a warrant in a reasonable  period of time. But cf. Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U.S. 740, 754 (1984) (holding  warrantless entry into and arrest in home unreasonable despite possibility that  evidence of noncriminal offense would be lost while warrant was being obtained).~    ~    C~    ~      20~      Nor are we persuaded by the countervailing considerations that the parties  or lower courts have raised. McArthur argues that the police proceeded without  probable cause. But McArthur has waived this argument. See 304 Ill. App. 3d, at  397, 713 N. E. 2d, at 95 (stating that McArthur does not contest existence of  probable cause); Brief in Opposition 7 (acknowledging probable cause). And, in  any event, it is without merit. See supra, at 4-5.~    ~    ~      21~      The Appellate Court of Illinois concluded that the police could not order  McArthur to stay outside his home because McArthur's porch, where he stood at  the time, was part of his home; hence the order \"amounted to a constructive  eviction\" of McArthur from his residence. 304 Ill. App. 3d, at 402, 713 N. E.  2d, at 98. This Court has held, however, that a person standing in the doorway  of a house is \"in a 'public' place,\" and hence subject to arrest without a  warrant permitting entry of the home. United States v. Santana, 427 U.S. 38, 42  (1976). Regardless, we do not believe the difference to which the Appellate  Court points-porch versus, e.g., front walk-could make a significant difference  here as to the reasonableness of the police restraint; and that, from the Fourth  Amendment's perspective, is what matters.~    ~    ~      22~      The Appellate Court also found negatively significant the fact that Chief  Love, with McArthur's consent, stepped inside the trailer's doorway to observe  McArthur when McArthur reentered the trailer on two or three occasions. 304 Ill.  App. 3d, at 402-403, 713 N. E. 2d, at 98. McArthur, however, reentered simply  for his own convenience, to make phone calls and to obtain cigarettes. Under  these circumstances, the reasonableness of the greater restriction (preventing  reentry) implies the reasonableness of the lesser (permitting reentry  conditioned on observation).~    ~    ~      23~      Finally, McArthur points to a case (and we believe it is the only case) that  he believes offers direct support, namely, Welsh v. Wisconsin, supra. In Welsh,  this Court held that police could not enter a home without a warrant in order to  prevent the loss of evidence (namely, the defendant's blood alcohol level) of  the \"nonjailable traffic offense\" of driving while intoxicated. 466 U.S., at  742, 754. McArthur notes that his two convictions are for misdemeanors, which,  he says, are as minor, and he adds that the restraint, keeping him out of his  home, was nearly as serious.~    ~    ~      24~      We nonetheless find significant distinctions. The evidence at issue here was  of crimes that were \"jailable,\" not \"nonjailable.\" See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch.  720, 550/4(a) (1998); ch. 730, 5/5-8-3(3) (possession of less than 2.5 grams  of marijuana punishable by up to 30 days in jail); ch. 720, 600/3.5; ch. 730,  5/5-8-3(1) (possession of drug paraphernalia punishable by up to one year in  jail). In Welsh, we noted that, \"[g]iven that the classification of state crimes  differs widely among the States, the penalty that may attach to any particular  offense seems to provide the clearest and most consistent indication of the  State's interest in arresting individuals suspected of committing that offense.\"  466 U.S., at 754, n. 14. The same reasoning applies here, where class C  misdemeanors include such widely diverse offenses as drag racing, drinking  alcohol in a railroad car or on a railroad platform, bribery by a candidate for  public office, and assault. See, e.g., Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 65, 5/4-8-2  (1998); ch. 610, 90/1; ch. 625, 5/11-504; ch. 720, 5/12-1.~    ~    ~      25~      And the restriction at issue here is less serious. Temporarily keeping a  person from entering his home, a consequence whenever police stop a person on  the street, is considerably less intrusive than police entry into the home  itself in order to make a warrantless arrest or conduct a search. Cf. Payton v.  New York, 445 U.S., at 585 (the Fourth Amendment's central concern is the  warrantless entry and search of the home).~    ~    ~      26~      We have explained above why we believe that the need to preserve evidence of  a \"jailable\" offense was sufficiently urgent or pressing to justify the  restriction upon entry that the police imposed. We need not decide whether the  circumstances before us would have justified a greater restriction for this type  of offense or the same restriction were only a \"nonjailable\" offense at issue.~    ~    III~    ~      27~      In sum, the police officers in this case had probable cause to believe that  a home contained contraband, which was evidence of a crime. They reasonably  believed that the home's resident, if left free of any restraint, would destroy  that evidence. And they imposed a restraint that was both limited and tailored  reasonably to secure law enforcement needs while protecting privacy interests.  In our view, the restraint met the Fourth Amendment's demands.~    ~    ~      28~      The judgment of the Illinois Appellate Court is reversed, and the case is  remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      29~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      30~      Justice Souter, concurring.~    ~    ~      31~      I join the Court's opinion subject to this afterword on two points: the  constitutionality of a greater intrusion than the one here and the  permissibility of choosing impoundment over immediate search. Respondent  McArthur's location made the difference between the exigency that justified  temporarily barring him from his own dwelling and circumstances that would have  supported a greater interference with his privacy and property. As long as he  was inside his trailer, the police had probable cause to believe that he had  illegal drugs stashed as his wife had reported and that with any sense he would  flush them down the drain before the police could get a warrant to enter and  search. This probability of destruction in anticipation of a warrant exemplifies  the kind of present risk that undergirds the accepted exigent circumstances  exception to the general warrant requirement. Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S.  757, 770-771 (1966). That risk would have justified the police in entering  McArthur's trailer promptly to make a lawful, warrantless search. United States  v. Santana, 427 U.S. 38, 42-43 (1976); Warden, Md. Penitentiary v. Hayden, 387  U.S. 294, 298-299 (1967). When McArthur stepped outside and left the trailer  uninhabited, the risk abated and so did the reasonableness of entry by the  police for as long as he was outside. This is so because the only justification  claimed for warrantless action here is the immediate risk, and the limit of  reasonable response by the police is set by the scope of the risk. See Terry v.  Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 25-26 (1968).~    ~    ~      32~      Since, however, McArthur wished to go back in, why was it reasonable to keep  him out when the police could perfectly well have let him do as he chose, and  then enjoyed the ensuing opportunity to follow him and make a warrantless search  justified by the renewed danger of destruction? The answer is not that the law  officiously insists on safeguarding a suspect's privacy from search, in  preference to respecting the suspect's liberty to enter his own dwelling.  Instead, the legitimacy of the decision to impound the dwelling follows from the  law's strong preference for warrants, which underlies the rule that a search  with a warrant has a stronger claim to justification on later, judicial review  than a search without one. See United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 106  (1965); see also 5 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure 11.2(b), p. 38 (3d ed. 1996)  (\"[M]ost states follow the rule which is utilized in the federal courts: if the  search or seizure was pursuant to a warrant, the defendant has the burden of  proof; but if the police acted without a warrant the burden of proof is on the  prosecution\"). The law can hardly raise incentives to obtain a warrant without  giving the police a fair chance to take their probable cause to a magistrate and  get one.~    ~    ~      33~      Justice Stevens, dissenting.~    ~    ~      34~      The Illinois General Assembly has decided that the possession of less than  2.5 grams of marijuana is a class C misdemeanor. See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720,  550/4(a) (1998). In so classifying the offense, the legislature made a  concerted policy judgment that the possession of small amounts of marijuana for  personal use does not constitute a particularly significant public policy  concern. While it is true that this offense-like feeding livestock on a public  highway or offering a movie for rent without clearly displaying its rating1-may  warrant a jail sentence of up to 30 days, the detection and prosecution of  possessors of small quantities of this substance is by no means a law  enforcement priority in the State of Illinois.2~    ~    ~      35~      Because the governmental interest implicated by the particular criminal  prohibition at issue in this case is so slight, this is a poor vehicle for  probing the boundaries of the government's power to limit an individual's  possessory interest in his or her home pending the arrival of a search warrant.  Cf. Segura v. United States, 468 U.S. 796 (1984) (seven Justices decline to  address this issue because case does not require its resolution). Given my  preference, I would, therefore, dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently  granted.~    ~    ~      36~      Compelled by the vote of my colleagues to reach the merits, I would affirm.  As the majority explains, the essential inquiry in this case involves a  balancing of the \"privacy-related and law enforcement-related concerns to  determine if the intrusion was reasonable.\" Ante, at 4. Under the specific facts  of this case, I believe the majority gets the balance wrong. Each of the  Illinois jurists who participated in the decision of this case placed a higher  value on the sanctity of the ordinary citizen's home than on the prosecution of  this petty offense. They correctly viewed that interest-whether the home be a  humble cottage, a secondhand trailer, or a stately mansion-as one meriting the  most serious constitutional protection.3 Following their analysis and the  reasoning in our decision in Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U.S. 740 (1984) (holding  that some offenses may be so minor as to make it unreasonable for police to  undertake searches that would be constitutionally permissible if graver offenses  were suspected), I would affirm.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~          See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 605, 5/9-124.1 (1998) (making feeding livestock  on a public highway a class C misdemeanor); Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720,  395/3-395/4 (1998) (making it a class C misdemeanor to sell or rent a video  that does not display the official rating of the motion picture from which it is  copied). Other examples of offenses classified as Class C misdemeanors in  Illinois include camping on the side of a public highway, Ill. Comp. Stat., ch.  605, 5/9-124 (1998), interfering with the \"lawful taking of wild animals,\" Ill.  Comp. Stat., ch. 720, 125/2 (1998), and tattooing the body of a person under 21  years of age, Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, 5/12-10 (1998).~      ~      ~        2~          Nor in many other States. Under the laws of many other States, the maximum  penalty McArthur would have faced for possession of 2.3 grams of marijuana would  have been less than what he faced in Illinois. See, e. g., Cal. Health  Safety  Code Ann. 11357(b) (West 1991) ($100 fine); Colo. Rev. Stat. 18-18-406(1)  (1999) ($100 fine); Minn. Stat. 152.027(4) (2000) ($200 fine and drug  education); Miss.

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.BUCKMAN COMPANY, PETITIONERv.PLAINTIFFS' LEGAL COMMITTEE~    No. 98-1768.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued December 4, 2000~    Decided February 21, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      Respondent represents plaintiffs claiming injuries caused by the use of orthopedic bone screws in the pedicles of their spines. Petitioner assisted the screws' manufacturer in securing approval for the devices from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency), which has regulatory authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), as amended by the Medical Devices Amendments of 1976 (MDA). While the screws are in a class that normally must go through a time-consuming process to receive premarket approval (PMA), they were approved under an exception, known as the 510(k) process, for predicate devices-devices that were already on the market when the MDA was enacted-and for devices that are \"substantially equivalent\" to predicate devices. The 510(k) application filed by petitioner and the manufacturer sought clearance to market the screws for use in arm and leg bones, not the spine. Claiming that the FDA would not have approved the screws had petitioner not made fraudulent representations regarding their intended use, plaintiffs sought damages under state tort law. The District Court dismissed these fraud-on-the-FDA claims on, inter alia, the ground that they were pre-empted by the MDA. The Third Circuit reversed.~      Held: The plaintiffs' state-law fraud-on-the-FDA claims conflict with, and are therefore impliedly pre-empted by, the FDCA, as amended by the MDA. Pp. 5-11.~      (a) The relationship between a federal agency and the entity it regulates is inherently federal because it originates from, is governed by, and terminates according to federal law. Because petitioner's FDA dealings were prompted by the MDA and the very subject matter of petitioner's statements were dictated by that statute-and in contrast to situations implicating \"federalism concerns and the historic primacy of state regulation of [health and safety matters],\" Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.S. 470, 485-no presumption against pre-emption obtains in this case. The conflict here stems from the fact that the federal statutory scheme amply empowers the FDA to punish and deter fraud against the Agency, and the Agency uses this authority to achieve a delicate balance of statutory objectives that can be skewed by allowing state-law fraud-on-the-FDA claims. While the 510(k) process lacks the PMA review's rigor, the former does set forth a comprehensive scheme for determining substantial equivalence with a predicate device. Other provisions give the FDA enforcement options that allow it to make a measured response to suspected fraud upon the Agency. This flexibility is a critical component of the framework under which the FDA pursues its difficult (and often competing) objectives of regulating medical device marketing and distribution without intruding upon decisions committed by the FDCA to health care professionals. Pp. 5-8.~      (b) State-law fraud-on-the-FDA claims inevitably conflict with the FDA's responsibility to police fraud consistently with the Agency's judgment and objectives. Complying with the FDA's detailed regulatory regime in the shadow of 50 States' tort regimes will dramatically increase the burdens facing potential applicants, who might be deterred from seeking approval of devices with potentially beneficial off-label uses-an accepted medical practice in which a device is used for some other purpose than that for which the FDA approved it-for fear of being exposed to unpredictable civil liability. Conversely, applicants' fear that their disclosures to the FDA will later be judged insufficient in state court might lead them to submit information that the Agency neither needs nor wants, thus delaying the comparatively speedy 510(k) process, and, in turn, impeding competition and delaying the prescription of appropriate off-label uses. Respondent's reliance on Silkwood v. Kerrnbhyph;McGee Corp., 464 U.S. 238, is misplaced. Silkwood was based on traditional state tort law principles, not on a fraud-on-the-agency theory, and, unlike Silkwood, there is clear evidence here that Congress intended that the MDA be enforced exclusively by the Federal Government. In addition, the MDA's express pre-emption provision does not bar the ordinary working of conflict pre-emption principles. Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U.S. 861, 869. And although Medtronic can be read to allow certain state-law causes of actions that parallel federal safety requirements, it does not stand for the proposition that any FDCA violation will support a state-law claim.

J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined. Stevens, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Thomas, J., joined.~      Opinion of the Court~      Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      Respondent represents plaintiffs who claim injuries resulting from the use of orthopedic bone screws in the pedicles of their spines. Petitioner is a consulting company that assisted the screws' manufacturer, AcroMed Corporation, in navigating the federal regulatory process for these devices. Plaintiffs say petitioner made fraudulent representations to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) in the course of obtaining approval to market the screws. Plaintiffs further claim that such representations were at least a \"but for\" cause of injuries that plaintiffs sustained from the implantation of these devices: Had the representations not been made, the FDA would not have approved the devices, and plaintiffs would not have been injured. Plaintiffs sought damages from petitioner under state tort law. We hold that such claims are pre-empted by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), 52 Stat. 1040, as amended by the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA), 90 Stat. 539, 21 U.S.C.  301 (1994 ed. and Supp. IV).~    ~    ~      2~      * Regulation of medical devices is governed by the two Acts just named. The MDA separates devices into three categories: Class I devices are those that present no unreasonable risk of illness or injury and therefore require only general manufacturing controls; Class II devices are those possessing a greater potential dangerousness and thus warranting more stringent controls; Class III devices \"presen[t] a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury\" and therefore incur the FDA's strictest regulation. 360c(a)(1)(c)(ii)(II). It is not disputed that the bone screws manufactured by AcroMed are Class III devices.~    ~    ~      3~      Class III devices must complete a thorough review process with the FDA before they may be marketed. This premarket approval (PMA) process requires the applicant to demonstrate a \"reasonable assurance\" that the device is both \"safe ... [and] effective under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof.\" 360e(d)(2)(A), (B). Among other information, an application must include all known reports pertaining to the device's safety and efficacy, see 360e(c)(1)(A); \"a full statement of the components, ingredients, and properties and of the principle or principles of operation of such device,\" 360e(c)(1)(B); \"a full description of the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and, when relevant, packing and installation of, such device,\" 360e(c)(1)(C); samples of the device (when practicable), see 360e(c)(1)(E); and \"specimens of the labeling proposed to be used for such device,\" 360e(c)(1)(F). The PMA process is ordinarily quite time consuming because the FDA's review requires an \"average of 1,200 hours [for] each submission.\" Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.S. 470, 477 (1996) (citing Hearings before the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment of the House Committee on Energy  Commerce, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. (Ser. No. 100-34), p. 384 (1987); Kahan, Premarket Approval Versus Premarket Notification: Different Routes to the Same Market, 39 Food Drug Cosm. L. J. 510, 512-514 (1984)).~    ~    ~      4~      An exception to the PMA requirement exists for devices that were already on the market prior to the MDA's enactment in 1976. See 21 U.S.C.  360e(b)(1)(A). The MDA allows these \"predicate\" devices to remain available until the FDA initiates and completes the PMA process. In order to avoid the potentially monopolistic consequences of this predicate-device exception, the MDA allows other manufacturers to distribute (also pending completion of the predicate device's PMA review) devices that are shown to be \"substantially equivalent\" to a predicate device. 360e(b)(1)(B).~    ~    ~      5~      Demonstrating that a device qualifies for this exception is known as the \"510(k) process,\" which refers to the section of the original MDA containing this provision. Section 510(k) submissions must include the following: \"Proposed labels, labeling, and advertisements sufficient to describe the device, its intended use, and the directions for its use,\" 21 CFR  807.87(e) (2000); \"[a] statement indicating the device is similar to and/or different from other products of comparable type in commercial distribution, accompanied by data to support the statement,\" 807.87(f); \"[a] statement that the submitter believes, to the best of his or her knowledge, that all data and information submitted in the premarket notification are truthful and accurate and that no material fact has been omitted,\" 807.87(k); and \"[a]ny additional information regarding the device requested by the [FDA] Commissioner that is necessary for the Commissioner to make a finding as to whether or not the device is substantially equivalent to a device in commercial distribution,\" 807.87(l).~    ~    ~      6~      In 1984, AcroMed sought 510(k) approval for its bone screw device, indicating it for use in spinal surgery. See In re Orthopedic Bone Screw Products Liability Litigation, 159 F.3d 817, 820 (CA3 1998). The FDA denied approval on the grounds that the Class III device lacked substantial equivalence to a predicate device. See ibid. In September 1985, with the assistance of petitioner, AcroMed filed another 510(k) application. \"The application provided additional information about the ... device and again indicated its use in spinal surgery. The FDA again rejected the application, determining that the device was not substantially equivalent to a predicate device and that it posed potential risks not exhibited by other spinal-fixation systems.\" Ibid. In December 1985, AcroMed and petitioner filed a third 510(k) application. \"AcroMed and [petitioner] split the ... device into its component parts, renamed them 'nested bone plates' and '[cancellous] bone screws' and filed a separate 510(k) application for each component. In both applications, a new intended use was specified: rather than seeking clearance for spinal applications, they sought clearance to market the plates and screws for use in the long bones of the arms and legs. AcroMed and Buckman claimed that the two components were substantially equivalent to predicate devices used in long bone surgery. The FDA approved the devices for this purpose in February 1986.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      7~      Pursuant to its designation by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation as the transferee court for In re: Orthopedic Bone Screw Liability Litigation, MDL No. 1014, the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania has been the recipient of some 2,300 civil actions related to these medical devices. Many of these actions include state-law causes of action claiming that petitioner and AcroMed made fraudulent representations to the FDA as to the intended use of the bone screws and that, as a result, the devices were improperly given market clearance and were subsequently used to the plaintiffs' detriment. The District Court dismissed these \"fraud-on-the-FDA\" claims, first on the ground that they were expressly pre-empted by the MDA, and then, after our decision in Medtronic, on the ground that these claims amounted to an improper assertion of a private right of action under the MDA.1 See 159 F.3d, at 821.~    ~    ~      8~      A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, concluding that plaintiffs' fraud claims were neither expressly nor impliedly pre-empted. We granted certiorari, 530 U.S. ___ (2000), to resolve a split among the Courts of Appeals on this question, see Kemp v. Medtronic, Inc., 231 F.3d 216, 233-236 (CA6 2000) (identifying split and holding such claims expressly pre-empted), and we now reverse.~    ~    II~    ~      9~      Policing fraud against federal agencies is hardly \"a field which the States have traditionally occupied,\" Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947), such as to warrant a presumption against finding federal pre-emption of a state-law cause of action. To the contrary, the relationship between a federal agency and the entity it regulates is inherently federal in character because the relationship originates from, is governed by, and terminates according to federal law. Cf. Boyle v. United Technologies Corp., 487 U.S. 500, 504-505 (1988) (allowing pre-emption of state law by federal common law where the interests at stake are \"uniquely federal\" in nature). Here, petitioner's dealings with the FDA were prompted by the MDA, and the very subject matter of petitioner's statements were dictated by that statute's provisions. Accordingly-and in contrast to situations implicating \"federalism concerns and the historic primacy of state regulation of matters of health and safety,\" Medtronic, 518 U.S., at 485-no presumption against pre-emption obtains in this case.~    ~    ~      10~      Given this analytical framework, we hold that the plaintiffs' state-law fraud-on-the-FDA claims conflict with, and are therefore impliedly pre-empted by federal law.2 The conflict stems from the fact that the federal statutory scheme amply empowers the FDA to punish and deter fraud against the Agency, and that this authority is used by the Agency to achieve a somewhat delicate balance of statutory objectives. The balance sought by the Agency can be skewed by allowing fraud-on-the-FDA claims under state tort law.~    ~    ~      11~      As described in greater detail above, the 510(k) process sets forth a comprehensive scheme for determining whether an applicant has demonstrated that a product is substantially equivalent to a predicate device. Among other information, the applicant must submit to the FDA \"[p]roposed labels, labeling, and advertisements sufficient to describe the device, its intended use, and the directions for its use,\" 21 CFR  807.87(e) (2000), and a statement attesting to and explaining the similarities to and/or differences from similar devices (along with supporting data), see 807.87(f ). The FDA is also empowered to require additional necessary information. See 807.87(l). Admittedly, the 510(k) process lacks the PMA review's rigor: The former requires only a showing of substantial equivalence to a predicate device, while the latter involves a time-consuming inquiry into the risks and efficacy of each device. Nevertheless, to achieve its limited purpose, the 510(k) process imposes upon applicants a variety of requirements that are designed to enable the FDA to make its statutorily required judgment as to whether the device qualifies under this exception.~    ~    ~      12~      Accompanying these disclosure requirements are various provisions aimed at detecting, deterring, and punishing false statements made during this and related approval processes. The FDA is empowered to investigate suspected fraud, see 21 U.S.C.  372; 21 CFR  5.35 (2000), and citizens may report wrongdoing and petition the agency to take action, 10.30. In addition to the general criminal proscription on making false statements to the Federal Government, 18 U.S.C.  1001 (1994 ed., Supp. IV),3 the FDA may respond to fraud by seeking injunctive relief, 21 U.S.C.  332 and civil penalties, 21 U.S.C.  333(f )(1)(A); seizing the device, 334(a)(2)(D); and pursuing criminal prosecutions, 333(a). The FDA4 thus has at its disposal a variety of enforcement options that allow it to make a measured response to suspected fraud upon the Agency.~    ~    ~      13~      This flexibility is a critical component of the statutory and regulatory framework under which the FDA pursues difficult (and often competing) objectives. For example, with respect to Class III devices, the FDA simultaneously maintains the exhaustive PMA and the more limited 510(k) processes in order to ensure both that medical devices are reasonably safe and effective and that, if the device qualifies under the 510(k) exception, it is on the market within a relatively short period of time. Similarly, \"off-label\" usage of medical devices (use of a device for some other purpose than that for which it has been approved by the FDA) is an accepted and necessary corollary of the FDA's mission to regulate in this area without directly interfering with the practice of medicine. See, e.g., Beck  Azari, FDA, Off-Label Use, and Informed Consent: Debunking Myths and Misconceptions, 53 Food  Drug L. J. 71, 76-77 (1998) (noting that courts, several States, and the \"FDA itself recogniz[e] the value and propriety of off-label use\"). Indeed, a recent amendment to the FDCA expressly states in part that \"[n]othing in this chapter shall be construed to limit or interfere with the authority of a health care practitioner to prescribe or administer any legally marketed device to a patient for any condition or disease within a legitimate health care practitioner-patient relationship.\" 21 U.S.C.  396 (1994 ed., Supp. IV). Thus, the FDA is charged with the difficult task of regulating the marketing and distribution of medical devices without intruding upon decisions statutorily committed to the discretion of health care professionals.~    ~    ~      14~      State-law fraud-on-the-FDA claims inevitably conflict with the FDA's responsibility to police fraud consistently with the Agency's judgment and objectives. As a practical matter, complying with the FDA's detailed regulatory regime in the shadow of 50 States' tort regimes will dramatically increase the burdens facing potential applicants-burdens not contemplated by Congress in enacting the FDCA and the MDA. Would-be applicants may be discouraged from seeking 510(k) approval of devices with potentially beneficial off-label uses for fear that such use might expose the manufacturer or its associates (such as petitioner) to unpredictable civil liability. In effect, then, fraud-on-the-FDA claims could cause the Agency's reporting requirements to deter off-label use despite the fact that the FDCA expressly disclaims any intent to directly regulate the practice of medicine, see 21 U.S.C.  396 (1994 ed., Supp. IV), and even though off-label use is generally accepted.5~    ~    ~      15~      Conversely, fraud-on-the-FDA claims would also cause applicants to fear that their disclosures to the FDA, although deemed appropriate by the Agency, will later be judged insufficient in state court. Applicants would then have an incentive to submit a deluge of information that the Agency neither wants nor needs, resulting in additional burdens on the FDA's evaluation of an application. As a result, the comparatively speedy 510(k) process could encounter delays, which would, in turn, impede competition among predicate devices and delay health care professionals' ability to prescribe appropriate off-label uses.6~    ~    ~      16~      Respondent relies heavily on Silkwood v. Kerrnbhyph;McGee Corp., 464 U.S. 238 (1984), which it reads to \"creat[e] a virtually irrefutable presumption against implied preemption of private damage remedies predicated on an alleged conflict with a federal remedial scheme.\" Brief for Respondent 34. Silkwood is different from the present case, however, in several respects. Silkwood's claim was not based on any sort of fraud-on-the-agency theory, but on traditional state tort law principles of the duty of care owed by the producer of plutonium fuel pins to an employee working in its plant. See 464 U.S., at 241. Moreover, our decision there turned on specific statutory evidence that Congress \"disclaimed any interest in promoting the development and utilization of atomic energy by means that fail to provide adequate remedies for those who are injured by exposure to hazardous nuclear materials.\" Id., at 257. In the present case, by contrast, we have clear evidence that Congress intended that the MDA be enforced exclusively by the Federal Government. 21 U.S.C.  337(a).~    ~    ~      17~      Respondent also suggests that we should be reluctant to find a pre-emptive conflict here because Congress included an express pre-emption provision in the MDA. See Brief for Respondent 37. To the extent respondent posits that anything other than our ordinary pre-emption principles apply under these circumstances, that contention must fail in light of our conclusion last Term in Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U.S. 861 (2000), that neither an express pre-emption provision nor a saving clause \"bar[s] the ordinary working of conflict pre-emption principles.\" Id., at 869.~    ~    ~      18~      We must also reject respondent's attempt to characterize both the claims at issue in Medtronic (common-law negligence action against the manufacturer of an allegedly defective pacemaker lead) and the fraud claims here as \"claims arising from violations of FDCA requirements.\" Brief for Respondent 38. Notwithstanding the fact that Medtronic did not squarely address the question of implied pre-emption, it is clear that the Medtronic claims arose from the manufacturer's alleged failure to use reasonable care in the production of the product, not solely from the violation of FDCA requirements. See 518 U.S., at 481. In the present case, however, the fraud claims exist solely by virtue of the FDCA disclosure requirements. Thus, although Medtronic can be read to allow certain state-law causes of actions that parallel federal safety requirements, it does not and cannot stand for the proposition that any violation of the FDCA will support a state-law claim.~    ~    ~      19~      In sum, were plaintiffs to maintain their fraud-on-the-agency claims here, they would not be relying on traditional state tort law which had predated the federal enactments in questions. On the contrary, the existence of these federal enactments is a critical element in their case. For the reasons stated above, we think this sort of litigation would exert an extraneous pull on the scheme established by Congress, and it is therefore pre-empted by that scheme.~    ~    ~      20~      The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.~    ~    ~      21~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         The District Court also determined that the plaintiffs' fraud claims failed for lack of proximate cause, see In re Orthopedic Bone Screw Products Liability Litigation, 159 F.3d 817, 821 (CA3 1998), but that question is not presently before us.~      ~      ~        2~         In light of this conclusion, we express no view on whether these claims are subject to express pre-emption under 21 U.S.C.  360k.~      ~      ~        3~         18 U.S.C.  1001(a) (1994 ed., Supp. IV) provides: \"[W]hoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact; [or] makes any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representation; or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry; shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.\"~      ~      ~        4~         The FDCA leaves no doubt that it is the Federal Government rather than private litigants who are authorized to file suit for noncompliance with the medical device provisions: \"[A]ll such proceedings for the enforcement, or to restrain violations, of this chapter shall be by and in the name of the United States.\" 21 U.S.C.  337(a).~      ~      ~        5~         See Green  Schultz, Tort Law Deference to FDA Regulation of Medical Devices, 88 Geo. L. J. 2119, 2133 (2000) (\"Physicians may prescribe drugs and devices for off-label uses\"); Smith, Physician Modification of Legally Marketed Medical Devices: Regulatory Implications Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 55 Food  Drug L. J. 245, 251-252 (2000) (discussing off-label use in terms of the \"practice of medicine doctrine[, which] stands firmly for the proposition that regulatory efforts are directed primarily at device marketing by manufacturers, not device use by physicians\"); Beck  Azari, FDA, Off-Label Use, and Informed Consent: Debunking Myths and Misconceptions, 53 Food  Drug L. J. 71, 72 (1998) (\"Off-label use is widespread in the medical community and often is essential to giving patients optimal medical care, both of which medical ethics, FDA, and most courts recognize\").~      ~      ~        6~         In light of the likely impact that the fraud-on-the-FDA claims would have on the administration of the Agency's duties, we must reject respondent's contention that these claims \"will ... affect only the litigants and will not have the kind of direct impact on the United States, which preemption is designed to protect from undue incursion.\" Brief for Respondent 30 (citing Miree v. DeKalb County, 433 U.S. 25 (1977)).~      ~    ~    ~      22~      Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring in the judgment.~    ~    ~      23~      As the Court points out, an essential link in the chain of causation that respondent must prove in order to prevail is that, but for petitioner's fraud, the allegedly defective orthopedic bone screws would not have reached the market. The fact that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has done nothing to remove the devices from the market, even though it is aware of the basis for the fraud allegations, convinces me that this essential element of the claim cannot be proved. I therefore agree that the case should not proceed.1~    ~    ~      24~      This would be a different case if, prior to the instant litigation, the FDA had determined that petitioner had committed fraud during the 510(k) process and had then taken the necessary steps to remove the harm-causing product from the market. Under those circumstances, respondent's state-law fraud claim would not depend upon speculation as to the FDA's behavior in a counterfactual situation but would be grounded in the agency's explicit actions. In such a case, a plaintiff would be able to establish causation without second-guessing the FDA's decisionmaking or overburdening its personnel, thereby alleviating the Government's central concerns regarding fraud-on-the-agency claims.~    ~    ~      25~      If the FDA determines both that fraud has occurred and that such fraud requires the removal of a product from the market, state damages remedies would not encroach upon, but rather would supplement and facilitate, the federal enforcement scheme. Cf. Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.S. 470, 495 (1996) (holding that the presence of a state-law damages remedy for violations of FDA requirements does not impose an additional requirement upon medical device manufacturers but \"merely provides another reason for manufacturers to comply with . . . federal law\"); id., at 513 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (same).2~    ~    ~      26~      Under the preemption analysis the Court offers today, however, parties injured by fraudulent representations to federal agencies would have no remedy even if recognizing such a remedy would have no adverse consequences upon the operation or integrity of the regulatory process. I do not believe the reasons advanced in the Court's opinion support the conclusion that Congress intended such a harsh result. Cf. Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U.S. 238, 251 (1984) (declining to infer that a federal statutory scheme that affords no alternative means of seeking redress preempted traditional state-law remedies). For that reason, although I concur in the Court's disposition of this case, I do not join its opinion.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         Though my analysis focuses on the failure of the plaintiffs to establish a necessary element of their claim, that failure is grounded not in the minutiae of state law but in the details of the federal regulatory system for medical devices. Therefore, while this case does not fit neatly into our pre-existing preemption jurisprudence, it is accurate, in a sense, to say that federal law \"preempts\" this state-law fraud-on-the-FDA claim because the FDA has not acknowledged such a fraud and taken steps to remove the device from the market.~      ~      ~        2~         Though the United States in this case appears to take the position that fraud-on-the-FDA claims conflict with the federal enforcement scheme even when the FDA has publicly concluded that it was defrauded and taken all the necessary steps to remove a device from the market, see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24, 30, that has not always been its position. As recently as 1994, the United States took the position that state law tort suits alleging fraud in FDA applications for medical devices do not conflict with federal law where the FDA has \"subsequently concluded\" that the device in question never met the appropriate federal requirements and \"initiated enforcement actions\" against those responsible for fraudulently obtaining its approval.

In an opinion disposing of both cases, the District Court granted petitioners summary judgment, agreeing with them that the ADA exceeds Congress' authority to abrogate the State's Eleventh Amendment immunity. The Eleventh Circuit reversed on the ground that the ADA validly abrogates such immunity.~      Held: Suits in federal court by state employees to recover money damages by reason of the State's failure to comply with Title I of the ADA are barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Pp. 4-17.~      (a) Congress may abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity when it both unequivocally intends to do so and acts pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional authority. Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 73. Only the second of these requirements is in dispute here. While Congress may not base abrogation of state immunity upon its Article I powers, see e.g., id., at 79, it may subject nonconsenting States to federal-court suit when it does so pursuant to a valid exercise of its power under 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, see e.g., id., at 80. Section 5 authorizes Congress to enforce the substantive guarantees contained in 1 of that Amendment by enacting \"appropriate legislation.\" See City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 536. Because it is this Court's responsibility, not Congress', to define the substance of constitutional guarantees, id., at 519-524, 5 legislation, to the extent it reaches beyond the precise scope of 1's protections, must exhibit congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end, id., at 520. Pp. 4-7.~      (b) The first step in applying these principles is to identify with some precision the scope of the constitutional right at issue. Here, that inquiry requires examination of the limitations 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment places upon States' treatment of the disabled. To do so, the Court looks to its prior decisions under the Equal Protection Clause dealing with this issue. Kimel, supra, at 83. In Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U.S. 432, the Court held, inter alia, that mental retardation did not qualify as a \"quasi-suspect\" classification for equal protection purposes, id., at 435, and that, accordingly, a city ordinance requiring a special use permit for the operation of a group home for the mentally retarded incurred only the minimum \"rational-basis\" review applicable to general social and economic legislation, id., at 446. Although \"negative attitudes\" and \"fear\" often accompany irrational biases, their presence alone does not a constitutional violation make. Thus, the Fourteenth Amendment does not require States to make special accommodations for the disabled, so long as their actions toward such individuals are rational. They could quite hardheadedly-and perhaps hardheartedly-hold to job-qualification requirements which do not make allowance for the disabled. If special accommodations for the disabled are to be required, they have to come from positive law and not through the Equal Protection Clause. Pp. 7-10.~      (c) The requirements for private individuals to recover money damages against the States-that there be state discrimination violative of the Fourteenth Amendment and that the remedy imposed by Congress be congruent and proportional to the targeted violation-are not met here. First, the ADA's legislative record fails to show that Congress identified a history and pattern of irrational employment discrimination by the States against the disabled. See, e.g., Kimel, supra, at 89. Because Eleventh Amendment immunity does not extend to local governmental units such as cities and counties, see Lincoln County v. Luning, 133 U.S. 529, 530, the Court rejects respondents' contention that the inquiry as to unconstitutional discrimination should extend to such units as well as to States. Congress made a general finding in the ADA that \"historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination ... continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem.\" 42 U.S.C.  12101(a)(2). Although the record includes instances to support such a finding, the great majority of these incidents do not deal with state activities in employment. Even if it were to be determined that the half a dozen relevant examples from the record showed unconstitutional action on the part of States, these incidents taken together fall far short of even suggesting the pattern of unconstitutional discrimination on which 5 legislation must be based. See, e.g., Kimel, supra, at 89-91. Moreover, statements in House and Senate committee reports indicate that Congresss targeted the ADA at employment discrimination in the private sector. Second, the rights and remedies created by the ADA against the States raise the same sort of concerns as to congruence and proportionality as were found in City of Boerne, supra. For example, while it would be entirely rational (and therefore constitutional) for a state employer to conserve scarce financial resources by hiring employees able to use existing facilities, the ADA requires employers to make such facilities readily accessible to and usable by disabled individuals, 12112(5)(B), 12111(9). The ADA does except employers from the \"reasonable accommodatio[n]\" requirement where the employer can demonstrate that accommodation would impose an \"undue hardship\" upon it, 12112(b)(5)(A), but, even with this exception, the accommodation duty far exceeds what is constitutionally required. The ADA's constitutional shortcomings are apparent when it is compared to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Holding the latter Act to be \"appropriate\" legislation to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment's protection against racial discrimination in voting, South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, this Court emphasized that Congress had there documented a marked pattern of unconstitutional action by the States, see id., at 312, and had determined that litigation had proved ineffective to remedy the problem, see id., at 313. The contrast between the kind of evidence detailed in Katzenbach, and the evidence that Congress considered in the present case, is stark. To uphold the ADA's application to the States would allow Congress to rewrite the Fourteenth Amendment law laid down by this Court in Cleburne. Section 5 does not so broadly enlarge congressional authority. Pp. 10-17. 193 F.3d 1214, reversed.~      CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT~      Rehnquist, C.

To this end, the Act requires employers to \"mak[e] reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless [the employer] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the [employer's] business.\" 12112(b)(5)(A).~    ~    ~      3~      \" '[R]easonable accommodation' may include-~    ~    ~      4~      \"(A) making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities; and (B) job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities.\" 12111(9).~    ~    ~      5~      The Act also prohibits employers from \"utilizing standards, criteria, or methods of administration ... that have the effect of discrimination on the basis of disability.\" 12112(b)(3)(A).~    ~    ~      6~      The Act defines \"disability\" to include \"(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment.\" 12102(2). A disabled individual is otherwise \"qualified\" if he or she, \"with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.\" 12111(8).~    ~    ~      7~      Respondent Patricia Garrett, a registered nurse, was employed as the Director of Nursing, OB/Gyn/Neonatal Services, for the University of Alabama in Birmingham Hospital. See App. 31, 38. In 1994, Garrett was diagnosed with breast cancer and subsequently underwent a lumpectomy, radiation treatment, and chemotherapy. See id., at 38. Garrett's treatments required her to take substantial leave from work. Upon returning to work in July 1995, Garrett's supervisor informed Garrett that she would have to give up her Director position. See id., at 39. Garrett then applied for and received a transfer to another, lower paying position as a nurse manager. See ibid.~    ~    ~      8~      Respondent Milton Ash worked as a security officer for the Alabama Department of Youth Services (Department). See id., at 8. Upon commencing this employment, Ash informed the Department that he suffered from chronic asthma and that his doctor recommended he avoid carbon monoxide and cigarette smoke, and Ash requested that the Department modify his duties to minimize his exposure to these substances. See ibid. Ash was later diagnosed with sleep apnea and requested, again pursuant to his doctor's recommendation, that he be reassigned to daytime shifts to accommodate his condition. See id., at 9. Ultimately, the Department granted none of the requested relief. See id., at 8-9. Shortly after Ash filed a discrimination claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, he noticed that his performance evaluations were lower than those he had received on previous occasions. See id., at 9.~    ~    ~      9~      Garrett and Ash filed separate lawsuits in the District Court, both seeking money damages under the ADA.2 Petitioners moved for summary judgment, claiming that the ADA exceeds Congress' authority to abrogate the State's Eleventh Amendment immunity. See 989 F. Supp. 1409, 1410 (ND Ala. 1998). In a single opinion disposing of both cases, the District Court agreed with petitioners' position and granted their motions for summary judgment. See id., at 1410, 1412. The cases were consolidated on appeal to the Eleventh Circuit. The Court of Appeals reversed, 193 F.3d 1214 (1999), adhering to its intervening decision in Kimel v. State Bd. of Regents, 139 F.3d 1426, 1433 (CA11 1998), cert. granted, 525 U.S. 1121, cert. dismissed, 528 U.S. 1184 (2000), that the ADA validly abrogates the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity.~    ~    ~      10~      We granted certiorari, 529 U.S. 1065 (2000), to resolve a split among the Courts of Appeals on the question whether an individual may sue a State for money damages in federal court under the ADA.~    ~    ~      11~      * The Eleventh Amendment provides:~    ~    ~      12~      \"The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\" Although by its terms the Amendment applies only to suits against a State by citizens of another State, our cases have extended the Amendment's applicability to suits by citizens against their own States. See Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 72-73 (2000); College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U.S. 666, 669-670 (1999); Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 54 (1996); Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 15 (1890). The ultimate guarantee of the Eleventh Amendment is that nonconsenting States may not be sued by private individuals in federal court. See Kimel, supra, at 73.~    ~    ~      13~      We have recognized, however, that Congress may abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity when it both unequivocally intends to do so and \"act[s] pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional authority.\" 528 U.S., at 73. The first of these requirements is not in dispute here. See 42 U.S.C.  12202 (\"A State shall not be immune under the eleventh amendment to the Constitution of the United States from an action in [a] Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction for a violation of this chapter\"). The question, then, is whether Congress acted within its constitutional authority by subjecting the States to suits in federal court for money damages under the ADA.~    ~    ~      14~      Congress may not, of course, base its abrogation of the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity upon the powers enumerated in Article I. See Kimel, supra, at 79 (\"Under our firmly established precedent then, if the [Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967] rests solely on Congress' Article I commerce power, the private petitioners in today's cases cannot maintain their suits against their state employers\"); Seminole Tribe, supra, at 72-73 (\"The Eleventh Amendment restricts the judicial power under Article III, and Article I cannot be used to circumvent the constitutional limitations placed upon federal jurisdiction\"); College Savings Bank, supra, at 672; Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 527 U.S. 627, 636 (1999); Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 730-733 (1999). In Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445 (1976), however, we held that \"the Eleventh Amendment, and the principle of state sovereignty which it embodies, are necessarily limited by the enforcement provisions of 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Id., at 456 (internal citation omitted). As a result, we concluded, Congress may subject nonconsenting States to suit in federal court when it does so pursuant to a valid exercise of its 5 power. See ibid. Our cases have adhered to this proposition. See, e.g., Kimel, supra, at 80. Accordingly, the ADA can apply to the States only to the extent that the statute is appropriate 5 legislation.3~    ~    ~      15~      Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment provides, in relevant part: \"No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment grants Congress the power to enforce the substantive guarantees contained in 1 by enacting \"appropriate legislation.\" See City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 536 (1997). Congress is not limited to mere legislative repetition of this Court's constitutional jurisprudence. \"Rather, Congress' power 'to enforce' the Amendment includes the authority both to remedy and to deter violation of rights guaranteed thereunder by prohibiting a somewhat broader swath of conduct, including that which is not itself forbidden by the Amendment's text.\" Kimel, supra, at 81; City of Boerne, supra, at 536.~    ~    ~      16~      City of Boerne also confirmed, however, the long-settled principle that it is the responsibility of this Court, not Congress, to define the substance of constitutional guarantees. 521 U.S., at 519-524. Accordingly, 5 legislation reaching beyond the scope of 1's actual guarantees must exhibit \"congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.\" Id., at 520. II~    ~    ~      17~      The first step in applying these now familiar principles is to identify with some precision the scope of the constitutional right at issue. Here, that inquiry requires us to examine the limitations 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment places upon States' treatment of the disabled.   As we did last Term in Kimel, see 528 U.S., at 83, we look to our prior decisions under the Equal Protection Clause dealing with this issue.~    ~    ~      18~      In Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U.S. 432 (1985), we considered an equal protection challenge to a city ordinance requiring a special use permit for the operation of a group home for the mentally retarded. The specific question before us was whether the Court of Appeals had erred by holding that mental retardation qualified as a \"quasi-suspect\" classification under our equal protection jurisprudence. Id., at 435. We answered that question in the affirmative, concluding instead that such legislation incurs only the minimum \"rational-basis\" review applicable to general social and economic legislation.4 Id., at 446. In a statement that today seems quite prescient, we explained that~    ~    ~      19~      \"if the large and amorphous class of the mentally retarded were deemed quasi-suspect for the reasons given by the Court of Appeals, it would be difficult to find a principled way to distinguish a variety of other groups who have perhaps immutable disabilities setting them off from others, who cannot themselves mandate the desired legislative responses, and who can claim some degree of prejudice from at least part of the public at large. One need mention in this respect only the aging, the disabled, the mentally ill, and the infirm. We are reluctant to set out on that course, and we decline to do so.\" Id., at 445-446.~    ~    ~      20~      Under rational-basis review, where a group possesses \"distinguishing characteristics relevant to interests the State has the authority to implement,\" a State's decision to act on the basis of those differences does not give rise to a constitutional violation. Id., at 441. \"Such a classification cannot run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause if there is a rational relationship between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose.\" Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 320 (1993) (citing Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1 (1992); New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U.S. 297, 303 (1976) (per curiam)). Moreover, the State need not articulate its reasoning at the moment a particular decision is made. Rather, the burden is upon the challenging party to negative \" 'any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.' \" Heller, supra, at 320 (quoting FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 313 (1993)).~    ~    ~      21~      Justice Breyer suggests that Cleburne stands for the broad proposition that state decisionmaking reflecting \"negative attitudes\" or \"fear\" necessarily runs afoul of the Fourteenth Amendment. See post, at 5 (dissenting opinion) (quoting Cleburne, 473 U.S., at 448). Although such biases may often accompany irrational (and therefore unconstitutional) discrimination, their presence alone does not a constitutional violation make. As we noted in Cleburne: \"[M]ere negative attitudes, or fear, unsubstantiated by factors which are properly cognizable in a zoning proceeding, are not permissible bases for treating a home for the mentally retarded differently ... .\" Id., at 448 (emphasis added). This language, read in context, simply states the unremarkable and widely acknowledged tenet of this Court's equal protection jurisprudence that state action subject to rational-basis scrutiny does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment when it \"rationally furthers the purpose identified by the State.\" Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 314 (1976) (per curiam).~    ~    ~      22~      Thus, the result of Cleburne is that States are not required by the Fourteenth Amendment to make special accommodations for the disabled, so long as their actions towards such individuals are rational. They could quite hard headedly-and perhaps hardheartedly-hold to job-qualification requirements which do not make allowance for the disabled. If special accommodations for the disabled are to be required, they have to come from positive law and not through the Equal Protection Clause.5~    ~    III~    ~      23~      Once we have determined the metes and bounds of the constitutional right in question, we examine whether Congress identified a history and pattern of unconstitutional employment discrimination by the States against the disabled. Just as 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment applies only to actions committed \"under color of state law,\" Congress' 5 authority is appropriately exercised only in response to state transgressions. See Florida Prepaid, 527 U.S., at 640 (\"It is this conduct then-unremedied patent infringement by the States-that must give rise to the Fourteenth Amendment violation that Congress sought to redress in the Patent Remedy Act\"); Kimel, 528 U.S., at 89 (\"Congress never identified any pattern of age discrimination by the States, much less any discrimination whatsoever that rose to the level of constitutional violation\"). The legislative record of the ADA, however, simply fails to show that Congress did in fact identify a pattern of irrational state discrimination in employment against the disabled.~    ~    ~      24~      Respondents contend that the inquiry as to unconstitutional discrimination should extend not only to States themselves, but to units of local governments, such as cities and counties. All of these, they say, are \"state actors\" for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. Brief for Respondents 8. This is quite true, but the Eleventh Amendment does not extend its immunity to units of local government. See Lincoln County v. Luning, 133 U.S. 529, 530 (1890). These entities are subject to private claims for damages under the ADA without Congress' ever having to rely on 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to render them so. It would make no sense to consider constitutional violations on their part, as well as by the States themselves, when only the States are the beneficiaries of the Eleventh Amendment.~    ~    ~      25~      Congress made a general finding in the ADA that \"historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem.\" 42 U.S.C.  12101(a)(2). The record assembled by Congress includes many instances to support such a finding. But the great majority of these incidents do not deal with the activities of States.~    ~    ~      26~      Respondents in their brief cite half a dozen examples from the record that did involve States. A department head at the University of North Carolina refused to hire an applicant for the position of health administrator because he was blind; similarly, a student at a state university in South Dakota was denied an opportunity to practice teach because the dean at that time was convinced that blind people could not teach in public schools. A microfilmer at the Kansas Department of Transportation was fired because he had epilepsy; deaf workers at the University of Oklahoma were paid a lower salary than those who could hear. The Indiana State Personnel Office informed a woman with a concealed disability that she should not disclose it if she wished to obtain employment.6~    ~    ~      27~      Several of these incidents undoubtedly evidence an unwillingness on the part of state officials to make the sort of accommodations for the disabled required by the ADA. Whether they were irrational under our decision in Cleburne is more debatable, particularly when the incident is described out of context. But even if it were to be determined that each incident upon fuller examination showed unconstitutional action on the part of the State, these incidents taken together fall far short of even suggesting the pattern of unconstitutional discrimination on which 5 legislation must be based. See Kimel, 528 U.S., at 89-91; City of Boerne, 521 U.S., at 530-531. Congress, in enacting the ADA, found that \"some 43,000,000 Americans have one or more physical or mental disabilities.\" 42 U.S.C.  12101(a)(1). In 1990, the States alone employed more than 4.5 million people. U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States 338 (119th ed. 1999) (Table 534). It is telling, we think, that given these large numbers, Congress assembled only such minimal evidence of unconstitutional state discrimination in employment against the disabled.~    ~    ~      28~      Justice Breyer maintains that Congress applied Title I of the ADA to the States in response to a host of incidents representing unconstitutional state discrimination in employment against persons with disabilities. A close review of the relevant materials, however, undercuts that conclusion. Justice Breyer's Appendix C consists not of legislative findings, but of unexamined, anecdotal accounts of \"adverse, disparate treatment by state officials.\" Post, at 3. Of course, as we have already explained, \"adverse, disparate treatment\" often does not amount to a constitutional violation where rational-basis scrutiny applies. These accounts, moreover, were submitted not directly to Congress but to the Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities, which made no findings on the subject of state discrimination in employment.7 See the Task Force's Report entitled From ADA to Empowerment (Oct. 12, 1990). And, had Congress truly understood this information as reflecting a pattern of unconstitutional behavior by the States, one would expect some mention of that conclusion in the Act's legislative findings. There is none. See 42 U.S.C.  12101. Although Justice Breyer would infer from Congress' general conclusions regarding societal discrimination against the disabled that the States had likewise participated in such action, post, at 3, the House and Senate committee reports on the ADA flatly contradict this assertion. After describing the evidence presented to the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources and its subcommittee (including the Task Force Report upon which the dissent relies), the Committee's report reached, among others, the following conclusion: \"Discrimination still persists in such critical areas as employment in the private sector, public accommodations, public services, transportation, and telecommunications.\" S. Rep. No. 101-116, p. 6 (1989) (emphasis added). The House Committee on Education and Labor, addressing the ADA's employment provisions, reached the same conclusion: \"[A]fter extensive review and analysis over a number of Congressional sessions, ... there exists a compelling need to establish a clear and comprehensive Federal prohibition of discrimination on the basis of disability in the areas of employment in the private sector, public accommodations, public services, transportation, and telecommunications.\" H. R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2 p. 28 (1990) (emphasis added). Thus, not only is the inference Justice Breyer draws unwarranted, but there is also strong evidence that Congress' failure to mention States in its legislative findings addressing discrimination in employment reflects that body's judgment that no pattern of unconstitutional state action had been documented.~    ~    ~      29~      Even were it possible to squeeze out of these examples a pattern of unconstitutional discrimination by the States, the rights and remedies created by the ADA against the States would raise the same sort of concerns as to congruence and proportionality as were found in City of Boerne, supra. For example, whereas it would be entirely rational (and therefore constitutional) for a state employer to conserve scarce financial resources by hiring employees who are able to use existing facilities, the ADA requires employers to \"mak[e] existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.\" 42 U.S.C.  12112(5)(B), 12111(9). The ADA does except employers from the \"reasonable accommodatio[n]\" requirement where the employer \"can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity.\" 12112(b)(5)(A). However, even with this exception, the accommodation duty far exceeds what is constitutionally required in that it makes unlawful a range of alternate responses that would be reasonable but would fall short of imposing an \"undue burden\" upon the employer. The Act also makes it the employer's duty to prove that it would suffer such a burden, instead of requiring (as the Constitution does) that the complaining party negate reasonable bases for the employer's decision. See ibid.~    ~    ~      30~      The ADA also forbids \"utilizing standards, criteria, or methods of administration\" that disparately impact the disabled, without regard to whether such conduct has a rational basis. 12112(b)(3)(A). Although disparate impact may be relevant evidence of racial discrimination, see Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239 (1976), such evidence alone is insufficient even where the Fourteenth Amendment subjects state action to strict scrutiny. See, e.g., ibid. (\"[O]ur cases have not embraced the proposition that a law or other official act, without regard to whether it reflects a racially discriminatory purpose, is unconstitutional solely because it has a racially disproportionate impact\").~    ~    ~      31~      The ADA's constitutional shortcomings are apparent when the Act is compared to Congress' efforts in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to respond to a serious pattern of constitutional violations. In South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301 (1966), we considered whether the Voting Rights Act was \"appropriate\" legislation to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment's protection against racial discrimination in voting. Concluding that it was a valid exercise of Congress' enforcement power under 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment,8 we noted that \"[b]efore enacting the measure, Congress explored with great care the problem of racial discrimination in voting.\" Id., at 308.~    ~    ~      32~      In that Act, Congress documented a marked pattern of unconstitutional action by the States. State officials, Congress found, routinely applied voting tests in order to exclude African-American citizens from registering to vote. See id., at 312. Congress also determined that litigation had proved ineffective and that there persisted an otherwise inexplicable 50-percentage-point gap in the registration of white and African-American voters in some States. See id., at 313. Congress' response was to promulgate in the Voting Rights Act a detailed but limited remedial scheme designed to guarantee meaningful enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment in those areas of the Nation where abundant evidence of States' systematic denial of those rights was identified.~    ~    ~      33~      The contrast between this kind of evidence, and the evidence that Congress considered in the present case, is stark. Congressional enactment of the ADA represents its judgment that there should be a \"comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.\" 42 U.S.C.  12101(b)(1). Congress is the final authority as to desirable public policy, but in order to authorize private individuals to recover money damages against the States, there must be a pattern of discrimination by the States which violates the Fourteenth Amendment, and the remedy imposed by Congress must be congruent and proportional to the targeted violation. Those requirements are not met here, and to uphold the Act's application to the States would allow Congress to rewrite the Fourteenth Amendment law laid down by this Court in Cleburne.9 Section 5 does not so broadly enlarge congressional authority. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore~    ~    ~      34~      Reversed.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         Respondents' complaints in the United States District Court alleged violations of both Title I and Title II of the ADA, and petitioners' \"Question Presented\" can be read to apply to both sections. See Brief for Petitioners i; Brief for United States I. Though the briefs of the parties discuss both sections in their constitutional arguments, no party has briefed the question whether Title II of the ADA, dealing with the \"services, programs, or activities of a public entity,\" 42 U.S.C.  12132 is available for claims of employment discrimination when Title I of the ADA expressly deals with that subject. See, e.g., Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (\"[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion\") (internal quotation marks omitted). The Courts of Appeals are divided on this issue, compare Zimmerman v. Oregon Dept. of Justice, 170 F.3d 1169 (CA9 1999), with Bledsoe v. Palm Beach Cty. Soil  Water Conservation Dist., 133 F.3d 816 (CA11 1998). We are not disposed to decide the constitutional issue whether Title II, which has somewhat different remedial provisions from Title I, is appropriate legislation under 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment when the parties have not favored us with briefing on the statutory question. To the extent the Court granted certiorari on the question whether respondents may sue their state employers for damages under Title II of the ADA, see this Court's Rule 24.1(a), that portion of the writ is dismissed as improvidently granted. See The Monrosa v. Carbon Black Export, Inc., 359 U.S. 180, 184 (1959).~      ~      ~        2~         Garrett raised other claims, but those are not presently before the Court.~      ~      ~        3~         It is clear that Congress intended to invoke 5 as one of its bases for enacting the ADA. See 42 U.S.C.  12101(b)(4).~      ~      ~        4~         Applying the basic principles of rationality review, Cleburne struck down the city ordinance in question. 473 U.S., at 447-450. The Court's reasoning was that the city's purported justifications for the ordinance made no sense in light of how the city treated other groups similarly situated in relevant respects. Although the group home for the mentally retarded was required to obtain a special use permit, apartment houses, other multiple-family dwellings, retirement homes, nursing homes, sanitariums, hospitals, boarding houses, fraternity and sorority houses, and dormitories were not subject to the ordinance. See ibid.~      ~      ~        5~         It is worth noting that by the time that Congress enacted the ADA in 1990, every State in the Union had enacted such measures. At least one Member of Congress remarked that \"this is probably one of the few times where the States are so far out in front of the Federal Government, it's not funny.\" Hearing on Discrimination Against Cancer Victims and the Handicapped before the Subcommittee on Employment Opportunities of the House Committee on Education and Labor, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., 5 (1987). A number of these provisions, however, did not go as far as the ADA did in requiring accommodation.~      ~      ~        6~         The record does show that some States, adopting the tenets of the eugenics movement of the early part of this century, required extreme measures such as sterilization of persons suffering from hereditary mental disease. These laws were upheld against constitutional attack 70 years ago in Buck v. Bell, 274 U.S. 200 (1927). But there is no indication that any State had persisted in requiring such harsh measures as of 1990 when the ADA was adopted.~      ~      ~        7~          Only a small fraction of the anecdotes Justice Breyer identifies in his Appendix C relate to state discrimination against the disabled in employment. At most, somewhere around 50 of these allegations describe conduct that could conceivably amount to constitutional violations by the States, and most of them are so general and brief that no firm conclusion can be drawn. The overwhelming majority of these accounts pertain to alleged discrimination by the States in the provision of public services and public accommodations, which areas are addressed in Titles II and III of the ADA.~      ~      ~        8~         Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment is virtually identical to 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.~      ~      ~        9~         Our holding here that Congress did not validly abrogate the States' sovereign immunity from suit by private individuals for money damages under Title I does not mean that persons with disabilities have no federal recourse against discrimination. Title I of the ADA still prescribes standards applicable to the States. Those standards can be enforced by the United States in actions for money damages, as well as by private individuals in actions for injunctive relief under Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908). In addition, state laws protecting the rights of persons with disabilities in employment and other aspects of life provide independent avenues of redress. See n. 5, supra.~      ~    ~    ~      35~      Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice O'Connor joins, concurring.   Prejudice, we are beginning to understand, rises not from malice or hostile animus alone. It may result as well from insensitivity caused by simple want of careful, rational reflection or from some instinctive mechanism to guard against people who appear to be different in some respects from ourselves. Quite apart from any historical documentation, knowledge of our own human instincts teaches that persons who find it difficult to perform routine functions by reason of some mental or physical impairment might at first seem unsettling to us, unless we are guided by the better angels of our nature. There can be little doubt, then, that persons with mental or physical impairments are confronted with prejudice which can stem from indifference or insecurity as well as from malicious ill will.~    ~    ~      36~      One of the undoubted achievements of statutes designed to assist those with impairments is that citizens have an incentive, flowing from a legal duty, to develop a better understanding, a more decent perspective, for accepting persons with impairments or disabilities into the larger society. The law works this way because the law can be a teacher. So I do not doubt that the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 will be a milestone on the path to a more decent, tolerant, progressive society.~    ~    ~      37~      It is a question of quite a different order, however, to say that the States in their official capacities, the States as governmental entities, must be held in violation of the Constitution on the assumption that they embody the misconceived or malicious perceptions of some of their citizens. It is a most serious charge to say a State has engaged in a pattern or practice designed to deny its citizens the equal protection of the laws, particularly where the accusation is based not on hostility but instead on the failure to act or the omission to remedy. States can, and do, stand apart from the citizenry. States act as neutral entities, ready to take instruction and to enact laws when their citizens so demand. The failure of a State to revise policies now seen as incorrect under a new understanding of proper policy does not always constitute the purposeful and intentional action required to make out a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. See Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229 (1976).~    ~    ~      38~      For the reasons explained by the Court, an equal protection violation has not been shown with respect to the several States in this case. If the States had been transgressing the Fourteenth Amendment by their mistreatment or lack of concern for those with impairments, one would have expected to find in decisions of the courts of the States and also the courts of the United States extensive litigation and discussion of the constitutional violations. This confirming judicial documentation does not exist. That there is a new awareness, a new consciousness, a new commitment to better treatment of those disadvantaged by mental or physical impairments does not establish that an absence of state statutory correctives was a constitutional violation.~    ~    ~      39~      It must be noted, moreover, that what is in question is not whether the Congress, acting pursuant to a power granted to it by the Constitution, can compel the States to act. What is involved is only the question whether the States can be subjected to liability in suits brought not by the Federal Government (to which the States have consented, see Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 755 (1999)), but by private persons seeking to collect moneys from the state treasury without the consent of the State. The predicate for money damages against an unconsenting State in suits brought by private persons must be a federal statute enacted upon the documentation of patterns of constitutional violations committed by the State in its official capacity. That predicate, for reasons discussed here and in the decision of the Court, has not been established. With these observations, I join the Court's opinion.~    ~    ~      40~      Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.~    ~    ~      41~      Reviewing the congressional record as if it were an administrative agency record, the Court holds the statutory provision before us, 42 U.S.C.  12202 unconstitutional. The Court concludes that Congress assembled insufficient evidence of unconstitutional discrimination, ante, at 12, that Congress improperly attempted to \"re-write\" the law we established in Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U.S. 432 (1985), ante, at 16, and that the law is not sufficiently tailored to address unconstitutional discrimination, ante, at 14-15.~    ~    ~      42~      Section 5, however, grants Congress the \"power to enforce, by appropriate legislation\" the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection guarantee. U.S. Const., Amdt. 14, 5. As the Court recognizes, state discrimination in employment against persons with disabilities might \" 'run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause' \" where there is no \" 'rational relationship between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose.' \" Ante, at 8 (quoting Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 320 (1993)). See also Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., supra, at 440 (stating that the Court will sustain a classification if it is \"rationally related to a legitimate state interest\"). In my view, Congress reasonably could have concluded that the remedy before us constitutes an \"appropriate\" way to enforce this basic equal protection requirement. And that is all the Constitution requires.~    ~    ~      43~      * The Court says that its primary problem with this statutory provision is one of legislative evidence. It says that \"Congress assembled only ... minimal evidence of unconstitutional state discrimination in employment.\" Ante, at 12. In fact, Congress compiled a vast legislative record documenting \" 'massive, society-wide discrimination' \" against persons with disabilities. S. Rep. No. 101-116, pp. 8-9 (1989) (quoting testimony of Justin Dart, chairperson of the Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities). In addition to the information presented at 13 congressional hearings (see Appendix A, infra), and its own prior experience gathered over 40 years during which it contemplated and enacted considerable similar legislation (see Appendix B, infra), Congress created a special task force to assess the need for comprehensive legislation. That task force held hearings in every State, attended by more than 30,000 people, including thousands who had experienced discrimination first hand. See From ADA to Empowerment, Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities, 16 (Oct. 12, 1990) (hereinafter Task Force Report). The task force hearings, Congress' own hearings, and an analysis of \"census data, national polls, and other studies\" led Congress to conclude that \"people with disabilities, as a group, occupy an inferior status in our society, and are severely disadvantaged socially, vocationally, economically, and educationally.\" 42 U.S.C.  12101(a)(6). As to employment, Congress found that \"[t]wo-thirds of all disabled Americans between the age of 16 and 64 [were] not working at all,\" even though a large majority wanted to, and were able to, work productively. S. Rep. No. 101-116, at 9. And Congress found that this discrimination flowed in significant part from \"stereotypic assumptions\" as well as \"purposeful unequal treatment.\" 42 U.S.C.  12101(a)(7).~    ~    ~      44~      The powerful evidence of discriminatory treatment throughout society in general, including discrimination by private persons and local governments, implicates state governments as well, for state agencies form part of that same larger society. There is no particular reason to believe that they are immune from the \"stereotypic assumptions\" and pattern of \"purposeful unequal treatment\" that Congress found prevalent. The Court claims that it \"make[s] no sense\" to take into consideration constitutional violations committed by local governments. Ante, at 71. But the substantive obligation that the Equal Protection Clause creates applies to state and local governmental entities alike. E.g., Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469 (1989). Local governments often work closely with, and under the supervision of, state officials, and in general, state and local government employers are similarly situated. Nor is determining whether an apparently \"local\" entity is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity as simple as the majority suggests-it often requires a \" 'detailed examination of the relevant provisions of [state] law.' \" Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Doe, 519 U.S. 425, 430, n. 6 (1997) (quoting Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U.S. 693, 719-721 (1973)).~    ~    ~      45~      In any event, there is no need to rest solely upon evidence of discrimination by local governments or general societal discrimination. There are roughly 300 examples of discrimination by state governments themselves in the legislative record. See, e.g., Appendix C, infra. I fail to see how this evidence \"fall[s] far short of even suggesting the pattern of unconstitutional discrimination on which 5 legislation must be based.\" Ante, at 12.~    ~    ~      46~      The congressionally appointed task force collected numerous specific examples, provided by persons with disabilities themselves, of adverse, disparate treatment by state officials. They reveal, not what the Court describes as \"half a dozen\" instances of discrimination, ante, at 11, but hundreds of instances of adverse treatment at the hands of state officials-instances in which a person with a disability found it impossible to obtain a state job, to retain state employment, to use the public transportation that was readily available to others in order to get to work, or to obtain a public education, which is often a prerequisite to obtaining employment. State-imposed barriers also frequently made it difficult or impossible for people to vote, to enter a public building, to access important government services, such as calling for emergency assistance, and to find a place to live due to a pattern of irrational zoning decisions similar to the discrimination that we held unconstitutional in Cleburne, 473 U.S., at 448. See Appendix C, infra.~    ~    ~      47~      As the Court notes, those who presented instances of discrimination rarely provided additional, independent evidence sufficient to prove in court that, in each instance, the discrimination they suffered lacked justification from a judicial standpoint. Ante, at 12 (stating that instances of discrimination are \"described out of context\"). Perhaps this explains the Court's view that there is \"minimal evidence of unconstitutional state discrimination.\" Ibid. But a legislature is not a court of law. And Congress, unlike courts, must, and does, routinely draw general conclusions-for example, of likely motive or of likely relationship to legitimate need-from anecdotal and opinion-based evidence of this kind, particularly when the evidence lacks strong refutation. See Task Force Report 16, 20 (task force \"met many times with significant representatives of groups opposed to [the] ADA,\" and as to the general public, although the task force received \"about 2,000 letters\" in support of the ADA, there was only \"one letter in opposition\"); S. Rep. No. 101-116, at 10 (summarizing testimony that many reasonable accommodations cost \"less than $50,\" and the expense of others, such as hiring employees who can interpret for the deaf, is \"frequently exaggerated\"). In reviewing 5 legislation, we have never required the sort of extensive investigation of each piece of evidence that the Court appears to contemplate. Compare ante, at 12-13, with Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641, 652-656 (1966) (asking whether Congress' likely conclusions were reasonable, not whether there was adequate evidentiary support in the record). Nor has the Court traditionally required Congress to make findings as to state discrimination, or to break down the record evidence, category by category. Compare ante, at 13 (noting statements in two congressional Reports that mentioned state discrimination in public services and transportation but not in employment), with Morgan, supra, at 654 (considering what Congress \"might\" have concluded); 384 U.S., at 652 (holding that likely discrimination against Puerto Ricans in areas other than voting supported statute abolishing literacy test as qualification for voting).~    ~    ~      48~      Regardless, Congress expressly found substantial unjustified discrimination against persons with disabilities. 42 U.S.C.  12101(9) (finding a pattern of \"unnecessary discrimination and prejudice\" that \"costs the United States billions of dollars in unnecessary expenses resulting from dependency and nonproductivity\" (emphasis added)). See also 2 Legislative History of the Americans with Disabilities Act (Leg. Hist.) (Committee Print compiled for the House Committee on Education and Labor), Ser. No. 102-B, p. 1620 (1990) (testimony of Arlene B. Mayerson) (describing \"unjustifiable and discriminatory loss of job opportunities\"); id., at 1623 (citing study showing \" 'strong evidence that employers' fears of low performance among disabled workers are unjustified' \"). Moreover, it found that such discrimination typically reflects \"stereotypic assumptions\" or \"purposeful unequal treatment.\" 42 U.S.C.  12101(7). See also 2 Leg. Hist. 1622 (testimony of Arlene B. Mayerson) (\"Outmoded stereotypes whether manifested in medical or other job 'requirements' that are unrelated to the successful performance of the job, or in decisions based on the generalized perceptions of supervisors and hiring personnel, have excluded many disabled people from jobs for which they are qualified\"). In making these findings, Congress followed our decision in Cleburne, which established that not only discrimination against persons with disabilities that rests upon \"a bare ... desire to harm a politically unpopular group,\" 473 U.S., at 447 (quoting Department of Agriculture v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 534 (1973) (omission in Cleburne)), violates the Fourteenth Amendment, but also discrimination that rests solely upon \"negative attitude[s],\" \"fea[r],\" 473 U.S., at 448, or \"irrational prejudice,\" id., at 450. Adverse treatment that rests upon such motives is unjustified discrimination in Cleburne's terms.~    ~    ~      49~      The evidence in the legislative record bears out Congress' finding that the adverse treatment of persons with disabilities was often arbitrary or invidious in this sense, and thus unjustified. For example, one study that was before Congress revealed that \"most ... governmental agencies in [one State] discriminated in hiring against job applicants for an average period of five years after treatment for cancer,\" based in part on coworkers' misguided belief that \"cancer is contagious.\" 2 Leg. Hist. 1619-1620 (testimony of Arlene B. Mayerson). A school inexplicably refused to exempt a deaf teacher, who taught at a school for the deaf, from a \"listening skills\" requirement. Government's Lodging 1503. A State refused to hire a blind employee as director of an agency for the blind-even though he was the most qualified applicant. Id., at 974. Certain state agencies apparently had general policies against hiring or promoting persons with disabilities. Id., at 1159, 1577. A zoo turned away children with Downs Syndrome \"because [the zookeeper] feared they would upset the chimpanzees.\" S. Rep. No. 101-116, at 7. There were reports of numerous zoning decisions based upon \"negative attitudes\" or \"fear,\" Cleburne, supra, at 448, such as a zoning board that denied a permit for an obviously pretextual reason after hearing arguments that a facility would house \" 'deviants' \" who needed \" 'room to roam,' \" Government's Lodging 1068. A complete listing of the hundreds of examples of discrimination by state and local governments that were submitted to the task force is set forth in Appendix C, infra. Congress could have reasonably believed that these examples represented signs of a widespread problem of unconstitutional discrimination.~    ~    II~    ~      50~      The Court's failure to find sufficient evidentiary support may well rest upon its decision to hold Congress to a strict, judicially created evidentiary standard, particularly in respect to lack of justification. Justice Kennedy's empirical conclusion-which rejects that of Congress-rests heavily upon his failure to find \"extensive litigation and discussion of constitutional violations,\" in \"the courts of the United States.\" Ante, at 2 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (emphasis added). And the Court itself points out that, when economic or social legislation is challenged in court as irrational, hence unconstitutional, the \"burden is upon the challenging party to negative any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.\" Ante, at 9 (internal quotation marks omitted). Or as Justice Brandeis, writing for the Court, put the matter many years ago, \" 'if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain' \" challenged legislation, then \" 'there is a presumption of the existence of that state of facts, and one who assails the classification must carry the burden of showing . . . that the action is arbitrary.' \" Pacific States Box  Basket Co. v. White, 296 U.S. 176, 185 (1935) (quoting Borden's Farm Products Co. v. Baldwin, 293 U.S. 194, 209 (1934)). Imposing this special \"burden\" upon Congress, the Court fails to find in the legislative record sufficient indication that Congress has \"negative[d]\" the presumption that state action is rationally related to a legitimate objective. Ante, at 9.~    ~    ~      51~      The problem with the Court's approach is that neither the \"burden of proof\" that favors States nor any other rule of restraint applicable to judges applies to Congress when it exercises its 5 power. \"Limitations stemming from the nature of the judicial process ... have no application to Congress.\" Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112, 248 (1970) (Brennan, White, and Marshall, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Rational-basis review-with its presumptions favoring constitutionality-is \"a paradigm of judicial restraint.\" FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 314 (1993) (emphasis added). And the Congress of the United States is not a lower court.~    ~    ~      52~      Indeed, the Court in Cleburne drew this very institutional distinction. We emphasized that \"courts have been very reluctant, as they should be in our federal system and with our respect for the separation of powers, to closely scrutinize legislative choices.\" 473 U.S., at 441. Our invocation of judicial deference and respect for Congress was based on the fact that \"[]5 of the [Fourteenth] Amendment empowers Congress to enforce [the equal protection] mandate.\" Id., at 439 (emphasis added). Indeed, we made clear that the absence of a contrary congressional finding was critical to our decision to apply mere rational-basis review to disability discrimination claims-a \"congressional direction\" to apply a more stringent standard would have been \"controlling.\" Ibid. See also Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 248 (1976) (refusing to invalidate a law based on the Equal Protection Clause because a disparate impact standard \"should await legislative prescription\"). Cf. Mitchell, supra, at 284 (Stewart, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\"Congress may paint with a much broader brush than may this Court, which must confine itself to the judicial function of deciding individual cases and controversies upon individual records\"). In short, the Court's claim that \"to uphold the Act's application to the States would allow Congress to rewrite the Fourteenth Amendment law laid down by this Court in Cleburne,\" ante, at 16, is repudiated by Cleburne itself.~    ~    ~      53~      There is simply no reason to require Congress, seeking to determine facts relevant to the exercise of its 5 authority, to adopt rules or presumptions that reflect a court's institutional limitations. Unlike courts, Congress can readily gather facts from across the Nation, assess the magnitude of a problem, and more easily find an appropriate remedy. Cf. Cleburne, supra, at 442-443 (addressing the problems of the \"large and diversified group\" of persons with disabilities \"is a difficult and often a technical matter, very much a task for legislators guided by qualified professionals and not by the perhaps ill-informed opinions of the judiciary\"). Unlike courts, Congress directly reflects public attitudes and beliefs, enabling Congress better to understand where, and to what extent, refusals to accommodate a disability amount to behavior that is callous or unreasonable to the point of lacking constitutional justification. Unlike judges, Members of Congress can directly obtain information from constituents who have first-hand experience with discrimination and related issues.~    ~    ~      54~      Moreover, unlike judges, Members of Congress are elected. When the Court has applied the majority's burden of proof rule, it has explained that we, i.e., the courts, do not \" 'sit as a superlegislature to judge the wisdom or desirability of legislative policy determinations.' \" Heller, 509 U.S., at 319 (quoting New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U.S. 297, 303 (1976) (per curiam)). To apply a rule designed to restrict courts as if it restricted Congress' legislative power is to stand the underlying principle-a principle of judicial restraint-on its head. But without the use of this burden of proof rule or some other unusually stringent standard of review, it is difficult to see how the Court can find the legislative record here inadequate. Read with a reasonably favorable eye, the record indicates that state governments subjected those with disabilities to seriously adverse, disparate treatment. And Congress could have found, in a significant number of instances, that this treatment violated the substantive principles of justification-shorn of their judicial-restraint-related presumptions-that this Court recognized in Cleburne.~    ~    III~    ~      55~      The Court argues in the alternative that the statute's damage remedy is not \"congruent\" with and \"proportional\" to the equal protection problem that Congress found. Ante, at 14 (citing City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 520 (1997)). The Court suggests that the Act's \"reasonable accommodation\" requirement, 42 U.S.C.  12112(b)(5)(A), and disparate impact standard, 12112(b)(3)(A), \"far excee[d] what is constitutionally required.\" Ante, at 14. But we have upheld disparate impact standards in contexts where they were not \"constitutionally required.\" Compare Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 432 (1971), with Washington, supra, at 239, and City of Rome v. United States, 446 U.S. 156, 172-173 (1980), with Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55, 62 (1980) (plurality opinion).~    ~    ~      56~      And what is wrong with a remedy that, in response to unreasonable employer behavior, requires an employer to make accommodations that are reasonable? Of course, what is \"reasonable\" in the statutory sense and what is \"unreasonable\" in the constitutional sense might differ. In other words, the requirement may exceed what is necessary to avoid a constitutional violation. But it is just that power-the power to require more than the minimum- that 5 grants to Congress, as this Court has repeatedly confirmed. As long ago as 1880, the Court wrote that 5 \"brought within the domain of congressional power\" whatever \"tends to enforce submission\" to its \"prohibitions\" and \"to secure to all persons ... the equal protection of the laws.\" Ex parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339, 346 (1880). More recently, the Court added that 5's \"draftsmen sought to grant to Congress, by a specific provision applicable to the Fourteenth Amendment, the same broad powers expressed in the Necessary and Proper Clause, Art. I, 8, cl. 18.\" Morgan, 384 U.S., at 650 (citing McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421 (1819)).~    ~    ~      57~      In keeping with these principles, the Court has said that \"[i]t is not for us to review the congressional resolution of \"the various conflicting considerations-the risk or pervasiveness of the discrimination in governmental services ... , the adequacy or availability of alternative remedies, and the nature and significance of the state interests that would be affected.\" 384 U.S., at 653. \"It is enough that we be able to perceive a basis upon which the Congress might resolve the conflict as it did.\" Ibid. See also South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 324 (1966) (interpreting the similarly worded enforcement Clause of the Fifteenth Amendment to permit Congress to use \"any rational means to effectuate the constitutional prohibition\"). Nothing in the words \"reasonable accommodation\" suggests that the requirement has no \"tend[ency] to enforce\" the Equal Protection Clause, Ex parte Virginia, supra, at 346, that it is an irrational way to achieve the objective, Katzenbach, 383 U.S., at 324, that it would fall outside the scope of the Necessary and Proper Clause, Morgan, supra, at 650, or that it somehow otherwise exceeds the bounds of the \"appropriate,\" U.S. Const., Amdt. 14, 5.~    ~    ~      58~      The Court's more recent cases have professed to follow the longstanding principle of deference to Congress. See Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 81 (2000) (\"Congress' 5 power is not confined to the enactment of legislation that merely parrots the precise wording of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Rather, Congress can prohibit a \"somewhat broader swath of conduct, including that which is not itself forbidden by the Amendment's text\"); Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 527 U.S. 627, 639 (1999) (\" 'Congress must have wide latitude' \") (quoting City of Boerne, supra, at 519-520); City of Boerne, 521 U.S., at 528 (reaffirming Morgan); 521 U.S., at 536 (Congress' \"conclusions are entitled to much deference\"). And even today, the Court purports to apply, not to depart from, these standards. Ante, at 7. But the Court's analysis and ultimate conclusion deprive its declarations of practical significance. The Court 'sounds the word of promise to the ear but breaks it to the hope.'~    ~    IV~    ~      59~      The Court's harsh review of Congress' use of its 5 power is reminiscent of the similar (now-discredited) limitation that it once imposed upon Congress' Commerce Clause power. Compare Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238 (1936), with United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 123 (1941) (rejecting Carter Coal's rationale). I could understand the legal basis for such review were we judging a statute that discriminated against those of a particular race or gender, see United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515 (1996), or a statute that threatened a basic constitutionally protected liberty such as free speech, see Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.S. 844 (1997); see also Post  Siegel, Equal Protection by Law: Federal Antidiscrimination Legislation After Morrison and Kimel, 110 Yale L. J. 441, 477 (2000) (stating that the Court's recent review of 5 legislation appears to approach strict scrutiny); 1 L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 5-16, p. 959 (3d ed. 2000) (same). The legislation before us, however, does not discriminate against anyone, nor does it pose any threat to basic liberty. And it is difficult to understand why the Court, which applies \"minimum 'rational-basis' review\" to statutes that burden persons with disabilities, ante, at 7-8, subjects to far stricter scrutiny a statute that seeks to help those same individuals.~    ~    ~      60~      I recognize nonetheless that this statute imposes a burden upon States in that it removes their Eleventh Amendment protection from suit, thereby subjecting them to potential monetary liability. Rules for interpreting 5 that would provide States with special protection, however, run counter to the very object of the Fourteenth Amendment. By its terms, that Amendment prohibits States from denying their citizens equal protection of the laws. U.S. Const., Amdt. 14, 1. Hence \"principles of federalism that might otherwise be an obstacle to congressional authority are necessarily overridden by the power to enforce the Civil War Amendments 'by appropriate legislation.' Those Amendments were specifically designed as an expansion of federal power and an intrusion on state sovereignty.\" City of Rome, 446 U.S., at 179. See also Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445, 456 (1976); Ex parte Virginia, supra, at 345.   And, ironically, the greater the obstacle the Eleventh Amendment poses to the creation by Congress of the kind of remedy at issue here-the decentralized remedy of private damage actions-the more Congress, seeking to cure important national problems, such as the problem of disability discrimination before us, will have to rely on more uniform remedies, such as federal standards and court injunctions, 42 U.S.C.  12188(a)(2), which are sometimes draconian and typically more intrusive. See College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U.S. 666, 704-705 (1999) (Breyer, J., dissenting). Cf. ante, at 15, n. 8. For these reasons, I doubt that today's decision serves any constitutionally based federalism interest.~    ~    ~      61~      The Court, through its evidentiary demands, its non-deferential review, and its failure to distinguish between judicial and legislative constitutional competencies, improperly invades a power that the Constitution assigns to Congress. Morgan, 384 U.S., at 648, n. 7 (The \"sponsors and supporters of the [Fourteenth] Amendment were primarily interested in augmenting the power of Congress\"). Its decision saps 5 of independent force, effectively \"confin[ing] the legislative power ... to the insignificant role of abrogating only those state laws that the judicial branch [is] prepared to adjudge unconstitutional.\" Id., at 648-649. Whether the Commerce Clause does or does not enable Congress to enact this provision, see, e.g., Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 100-185 (1996) (Souter, J., joined by Ginsburg and Breyer, JJ., dissenting); College Savings Bank, supra, at 699-700 (Breyer, J., dissenting), in my view, 5 gives Congress the necessary authority.~    ~    ~      62~      For the reasons stated, I respectfully dissent.~    ~    ~      63~      APPENDIX A TO OPINION OF BREYER, J.~    ~    ~      64~      Congressional hearings on the Americans with Disabilities Act Americans with Disabilities Act of 1989: Hearings on H.

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.CENTRAL GREEN CO., PETITIONERv.UNITED STATES~    No. 99-859.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued October 30, 2000~    Decided February 21, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      The Madera Canal, a federal facility leased to the Madera Irrigation District (MID), flows through petitioner's California orchards. Petitioner brought suit against respondent United States and the MID alleging that their negligence in the canal's design, construction, and maintenance caused subsurface flooding resulting in damage to the orchards and increased operating costs for petitioner. The complaint sought damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act and other relief. Relying on the immunity granted by the Flood Control Act of 1928, 33 U.S.C.  702c-which states that \"[n]o liability of any kind shall attach to or rest upon the United States for any damage from or by floods or flood waters at any place\"-the United States moved for judgment on the pleadings. The District Court dismissed the complaint because the parties agreed that the canal was a part of the Friant Division of the Central Valley Project, and that flood control was one of that project's purposes. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that although the canal serves no flood control purpose, immunity attached solely because it is a branch of the larger project.~      Held: In determining whether 702c immunity attaches, courts should consider the character of the waters that cause the relevant damage and the purposes behind their release rather than the relation between that damage and a flood control project. Pp. 3-12.~      (a) A passage in United States v. James, 478 U.S. 597, 605-which states that it is \"clear from 702c's plain language that the terms 'flood' and 'flood waters' apply to all waters contained in or carried through a federal flood control project for purposes of or related to flood control\"-lends support to the Ninth Circuit's holding, but is unquestionably dictum. It is therefore appropriate to resort to the statute's text, as illuminated by the James holding, rather than to that isolated comment, to determine whether the water flowing through the canal that allegedly damaged petitioner's orchards is covered by 702c. The James holding-that the phrase \"flood or flood waters\" encompasses waters that are released for flood control purposes when reservoired waters are at flood stage-is vastly different from the Ninth Circuit's reading of 702c, under which immunity attaches simply because the Madera Canal is part of the Friant Division of the Central Valley Project, and flood control is one of the project's purposes. Pp. 3-6.~      (b) To characterize every drop of water flowing through the immense Central Valley Project as \"flood water\" simply because flood control is among its purposes unnecessarily dilutes the statute's language. The statute's text does not include the words \"flood control project,\" but, rather, states that immunity attaches to \"any damage from or by floods or flood waters.\" Pp. 7-9.~      (c) Neither the statute's language nor the James holding even arguably supports the Government's conclusion that 702c immunity must attach to all the water flowing through the canal, even if the water never approached flood stage and the terminus of the canal was parched at the end of the summer. Accordingly, the Court disavows the \"related to\" portion of James' dicta. Pp. 9-11.~      (d) Because the question of immunity was decided on the pleadings, using an incorrect test and without benefit of an evidentiary hearing or further factual development, the case is remanded for further proceedings. Pp. 11-12. 177 F.3d 834, reversed and remanded.~      CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT~      Stevens, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      Incident to the authorization of a massive flood control project for the Mississippi River in 1928, Congress enacted an immunity provision which stated that \"[n]o liability of any kind shall attach to or rest upon the United States for any damage from or by floods or flood waters at any place.\" 45 Stat. 535, as amended, 33 U.S.C.  702c. At issue in this case is the meaning of the words \"floods or flood waters.\" The narrow question presented is whether those words encompass all the water that flows through a federal facility that was designed and is operated, at least in part, for flood control purposes. The Ninth Circuit, relying upon a broader construction of 702c than some other federal courts have adopted, concluded that they do. We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict, 529 U.S. 1017 (2000), and now reverse.~    ~    ~      2~      * Petitioner owns 1,000 acres of pistachio orchards in California's San Joaquin Valley. The Madera Canal, a federal facility that has been leased to the Madera Irrigation District (MID), flows through petitioner's property. In 1996, petitioner brought this action against respondent United States and the MID alleging that their negligence in the design, construction, and maintenance of the canal had caused subsurface flooding resulting in damage to the orchards and increased operating costs for petitioner. Petitioner did not allege that any physical failure of the dam caused the damage to its property. The complaint sought damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C.  2671 et seq., as well as injunctive relief. Relying on the immunity granted by the Flood Control Act of 1928, 33 U.S.C.  702c the United States moved for judgment on the pleadings.~    ~    ~      3~      Accepting petitioner's submission that the Madera Canal was used for irrigation purposes, the District Court nevertheless dismissed the complaint because the parties agreed that the canal was a part of the Friant Division of the Central Valley Project, and that flood control was one of the purposes of that project. The District Court's decision was dictated by an earlier Ninth Circuit case, which held that if a \" 'project has flood control as one of its purposes, and the events giving rise to the action were not wholly unrelated to the project,' \" immunity necessarily attached.1~    ~    ~      4~      On appeal, the Ninth Circuit affirmed. It agreed with petitioner that the Madera Canal \"serves no flood control purpose,\" but nevertheless held that immunity attached \"solely because it is a branch of the Central Valley Project.\" 177 F.3d 834, 839 (1999). As the Ninth Circuit put it, \"[a]lthough the water in the Madera Canal was not held for the purpose of flood control, because it was part of the Central Valley Project, it was 'not wholly unrelated' to flood control.\" Ibid. (emphasis added). In so holding, however, the court recognized that the Government would probably not have enjoyed immunity in at least three other Circuits where the courts require a nexus between flood control activities and the harm done to the plaintiff.2 Noting the \"harsh result of [the] decision,\" the Ninth Circuit frankly acknowledged that \"[t]he 'not wholly unrelated' test applied by this and other circuits reads broadly an already broadly written grant of immunity.\" Ibid. As the Ninth Circuit recognized, under such a test, there would seem to be no \"set of facts where the government is not immune from damage arising from water that at one time passed through part of the Central Valley or other flood control project.\" Ibid.~    ~    II~    ~      5~      Not until more than a half century after its enactment did this Court have occasion to interpret 702c. In a consolidated case arising out of two separate accidents, we held that the section \"bars recovery where the Federal Government would otherwise be liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C.  2671 et seq., for personal injury caused by the Federal Government's negligent failure to warn of the dangers from the release of floodwaters from federal flood control projects.\" United States v. James, 478 U.S. 597, 599 (1986).~    ~    ~      6~      The principal issue in the James case was whether the statutory word \"damage\" encompassed not just property damage, but also personal injuries and death. In light of the legislative history, which it reviewed at some length, id., at 606-609, 610-612, the Court concluded that the best reading of the statutory text was one which was both broader and less literal, and which encompassed the claims at issue in the two cases before the Court.~    ~    ~      7~      In both instances, the injuries were caused by the turbulent current generated by unwarned releases of waters from a reservoir after the Army Corps of Engineers had determined that the waters were at \"flood stage.\" The fact that the injuries were caused by \"flood waters\" was undisputed.3 In its opinion, the Court held that the language of the statute covered the two accidents because the \"injuries occurred as a result of the release of waters from reservoirs that had reached flood stage.\" Id., at 604.~    ~    ~      8~      Nevertheless, the Court's opinion in James included a passage that lends support to the Ninth Circuit's holding in this case. In that passage, the Court wrote:~    ~    ~      9~      \"Nor do the terms 'flood' and 'flood waters' create any uncertainty in the context of accidents such as the ones at issue in these cases. The Act concerns flood control projects designed to carry floodwaters. It is thus clear from 702c's plain language that the terms 'flood' and 'flood waters' apply to all waters contained in or carried through a federal flood control project for purposes of or related to flood control, as well as to waters that such projects cannot control.\" Id., at 605 (emphasis added).4~    ~    ~      10~      The sentence that we have italicized and, in particular, the phrase \"related to flood control\" have generated conflicting opinions among the Courts of Appeals. In an attempt to make sense of what is admittedly confusing dicta, some courts have focused on whether the damage relates in some, often tenuous, way to a flood control project, rather than whether it relates to \"floods or flood waters.\"5 However, more than one court has pointed out that, if read literally, the sentence sweeps so broadly as to make little sense.6 Moreover, the sentence was unquestionably dictum because it was not essential to our disposition of any of the issues contested in James.7 It is therefore appropriate to resort to the text of the statute, as illuminated by our holding in James, rather than to that isolated comment, to determine whether the water flowing through the Madera Canal that allegedly caused the damage to petitioner's pistachio orchards is covered by 702c. See Humphrey's Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602, 627 (1935) (dicta \"may be followed if sufficiently persuasive\" but are not binding). See also U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U.S. 18, 24 (1994).~    ~    ~      11~      In James, we held that the phrase \"floods or flood waters\" is not narrowly confined to those waters that a federal project is unable to control, and that it encompasses waters that are released for flood control purposes when reservoired waters are at flood stage. That holding, however, is vastly different from the Ninth Circuit's reading of 702c, under which immunity attaches simply because the Madera Canal is part of the Friant Division of the Central Valley Project, and flood control is one of the purposes served by that project. The holding in James also differs from the less attenuated and more fact-specific position advanced by the Government, which would require us to take judicial notice of evidence that the Friant Division of the Central Valley Project and, indeed, the Madera Canal itself can and do serve flood control purposes. We ultimately conclude that the judgment cannot be upheld under either rationale, but begin with a description of the Central Valley Project and an explanation of the factual basis for the Government's submission.~    ~    III~    ~      12~      We begin by observing that water can be either a liability or an asset. The Mississippi River flood of 1927 was unquestionably an example of the former. That flood in turn led to the enactment of the 1928 Flood Control Act. Similar, though less extreme, floods of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers in California provided an important motivation for the authorization of the Central Valley Project. Although that project has not completely eliminated flooding on either river, it has succeeded in converting a huge liability into an immensely valuable asset. Justice Jackson described the magnitude of that transformation in his opinion for the Court in United States v. Gerlach Live Stock Co., 339 U.S. 725 (1950):~    ~    ~      13~      \"This is a gigantic undertaking to redistribute the principal fresh-water resources of California. Central Valley is a vast basin, stretching over 400 miles on its polar axis and a hundred in width, in the heart of California. Bounded by the Sierra Nevada on the east and by coastal ranges on the west, it consists actually of two separate river valleys which merge in a single pass to the sea at the Golden Gate. Its rich acres, counted in the millions, are deficient in rainfall and must remain generally arid and unfruitful unless artificially watered.~    ~    ~      14~      . . . . .~    ~    ~      15~      \"To . . . make water available where it would be of greatest service, the State of California proposed to re-engineer its natural water distribution. This project was taken over by the United States in 1935 and has since been a federal enterprise. The plan, in broad outline, is to capture and store waters of both rivers and many of their tributaries in their highland basins, in some cases taking advantage of the resulting head for generation of electric energy. . . . [T]he waters of the San Joaquin will be arrested at Friant, where they would take leave of the mountains, and will be diverted north and south through a system of canals and sold to irrigate more than a million acres of land, some as far as 160 miles away. A cost of refreshing this great expanse of semiarid land is that, except for occasional spills, only a dry river bed will cross the plain below the dam. Here, however, surplus waters from the north are utilized, for through a 150-mile canal Sacramento water is to be pumped to the cultivated lands formerly dependent on the San Joaquin.\" Id., at 728-729.~    ~    ~      16~      \"The Central Valley basin development envisions, in one sense, an integrated undertaking, but also an aggregate of many subsidiary projects, each of which is of first magnitude. It consists of thirty-eight major dams and reservoirs bordering the valley floor and scores of smaller ones in head waters. It contemplates twenty-eight hydropower generating stations. It includes hundreds of miles of main canals, thousands of miles of laterals and drains, electric transmission and feeder lines and substations, and a vast network of structures for the control and use of water on two million acres of land already irrigated, three million acres of land to be newly irrigated, 360,000 acres in the delta needing protection from intrusions of salt water, and for municipal and miscellaneous purposes including cities, towns, duck clubs and game refuges. These projects are not only widely separated geographically, many of them physically independent in operation, but they are authorized in separate acts from year to year and are to be constructed at different times over a considerable span of years.\" Id., at 733.~    ~    ~      17~      Justice Jackson's description of the magnitude of the Central Valley Project makes one proposition perfectly clear: to characterize every drop of water that flows through that immense project as \"flood water\" simply because flood control is among the purposes served by the project unnecessarily dilutes the language of the statute. The text of the statute does not include the words \"flood control project.\" Rather, it states that immunity attaches to \"any damage from or by floods or flood waters . . . .\" Accordingly, the text of the statute directs us to determine the scope of the immunity conferred, not by the character of the federal project or the purposes it serves, but by the character of the waters that cause the relevant damage and the purposes behind their release.~    ~    IV~    ~      18~      The Government has asked us to take judicial notice of certain basic facts about the Friant Division of the Central Valley Project and about the waters flowing through that division and, more particularly, through the Madera Canal. Although petitioner will have an opportunity to challenge those details on remand, we accept them for purposes of this opinion.~    ~    ~      19~      The two major rivers supplying water to the Central Valley Project are the Sacramento in the north, and the San Joaquin in the south. From its headwaters in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, the San Joaquin flows in a southwesterly direction into a reservoir, known as Millerton Lake, just above the Friant Dam. The reservoir has a storage capacity of 520,500 acre-feet of water. In dry years, the total flow in the river does not produce that amount, but on average, the annual flow apparently approximates 31/2 times the reservoir's capacity. Water is released through outlets in the dam that send it down the San Joaquin River, and also through outlets that direct it into either the Madera Canal to the northwest, or the Friant-Kern Canal to the southeast. When the water level exceeds 578 feet, it flows over the dam's spillway into the San Joaquin. At that point, the river can accommodate a flow of 8,000 cubic feet per second without flooding. The Madera Canal can accommodate 1,200 cubic feet per second, and the Friant-Kern another 4,500 cubic feet per second. Thus, a total release of 13,700 cubic feet per second in three directions would not appear to include any \"flood water.\"~    ~    ~      20~      The Madera Canal, which is about 40 miles in length, is used primarily for irrigation purposes. Water that enters the canal at the Friant Dam is purchased by farmers who either use it immediately or store it for future use. As a result, the amount of water that enters the canal is larger than the quantity that may flow into the Chowchilla River at its terminus.8 Except in years of extreme drought, the Madera Irrigation District provides contracting farmers with \"a dependable water supply\" of approximately 138,000 acre-feet of \"Class 1 water.\" In addition, \"if, as, and when it can be made available,\" the District sells \"Class 2 water\" to the farmers at a price that is lower than the Class 1 price because of the \"uncertainty as to availability and time of occurrence.\"9 Thus, again in a literal sense, it seems clear that none of the Class 1 or Class 2 water sold by the District and purchased by the farmers to store or irrigate their lands include any \"flood water.\"~    ~    ~      21~      Water that is not purchased under either class simply flows through the canal into the Chowchilla River. As the Government points out, that excess may include flood water. However, given the fact that the canal can accommodate a flow of 1,200 cubic feet per second, which amounts to about 2,380 acre-feet per day, it is entirely possible that over the span of a year, several times the amount of Class 1 and Class 2 waters described in the papers submitted by the Government could flow through the canal without causing anything approaching a flood. Nevertheless, according to the Government, because the Madera Canal is available to divert water that might otherwise produce a flood on the San Joaquin and flood control is among the purposes served by the canal, 702c immunity must attach to all the water that flows through the canal. Under the Government's approach, this would be true even if the water never approached flood stage and the terminus of the canal was parched at the end of the summer. Admittedly, it is possible to read the \"related to\" portion of the dictum from James to support that result, but neither the language of the statute itself, nor the holding in James, even arguably supports such a strange conclusion. Accordingly, we disavow that portion of James' dicta.~    ~    V~    ~      22~      This case does raise a difficult issue because the property damage at issue was allegedly caused by continuous or repeated flows occurring over a period of years, rather than by a single, discrete incident. It is relatively easy to determine that a particular release of water that has reached flood stage is \"flood water,\" as in James, or that a release directed by a power company for the commercial purpose of generating electricity is not, as in Henderson v. United States, 965 F.2d 1488 (CA8 1992). It is, however, not such a simple matter when damage may have been caused over a period of time in part by flood waters and in part by the routine use of the canal when it contained little more than a trickle. The fact that a serious flood did occur in the San Joaquin in 1997 creates the distinct possibility that flood waters may have surged down the Madera Canal and harmed petitioner's property.~    ~    ~      23~      For present purposes, we merely hold that it was error to grant the Government's motion for judgment on the pleadings and that it is the text of 702c, as informed by our holding in James, rather than the broad dictum in that opinion, that governs the scope of the United States' immunity from liability for damage caused \"by floods or flood waters.\" Accordingly, in determining whether 702c immunity attaches, courts should consider the character of the waters that cause the relevant damage rather than the relation between that damage and a flood control project.~    ~    ~      24~      The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      25~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         App. to Pet. for Cert. 15 (quoting Washington v. East Columbia Basin Irrigation Dist., 105 F.3d 517, 520 (1997)).~      ~      ~        2~         Citing Fryman v. United States, 901 F.2d 79 (CA7 1990); Boyd v. United States, 881 F.2d 895 (CA10 1989); and Hayes v. United States, 585 F.2d 701 (CA4 1978), the Ninth Circuit specifically identified the Fourth, Seventh, and Tenth Circuits as ones which likely would have reached a different result.~      ~      ~        3~         The first case arose out of an incident at the Millwood Dam in Arkansas, when \"the level of the Reservoir was such that the United States Corps of Engineers designated it at 'flood stage.' As part of the flood control function of the Millwood facility, the Corps of Engineers began to release water through the tainter gates. This release created a swift, strong current toward the underwater discharge.\" 478 U.S., at 599. The second case arose as a result of a decision by the Corps of Engineers to release waters in the reservoir of Bayou Courtableau Basin which \"were at flood stage.\" Id., at 601. The District Court found that 702c applied because the \" 'gates were opened to prevent flooding and inundation landside of the drainage structure.' \" Id., at 602 (emphasis added).~      ~      ~        4~         The Court appended a footnote pointing out that the District Court in each case had found that the waters at issue had been \"released from flood control facilities to prevent flooding\" and that the Court of Appeals had upheld those findings \"and assumed that 'the waters in this [consolidated] case were floodwaters.' \" See id., at 606, n. 7.~      ~      ~        5~         See, e.g., Washington v. East Columbia Basin Irrigation Dist., 105 F.3d 517 (CA9 1997); Williams v. United States, 957 F.2d 742 (CA10 1992); Dawson v. United States, 894 F.2d 70 (CA3 1990); DeWitt Bank  Trust Co. v. United States, 878 F.2d 246 (CA8 1989). This approach, however, can be overinclusive. As Judge Easterbrook has pointed out: \"The 'management of a flood control project' includes building roads to reach the beaches and hiring staff to run the project. If the Corps of Engineers should allow a walrus-sized pothole to swallow tourists' cars on the way to the beach, or if a tree-trimmer's car should careen through some picnickers, these injuries would be 'associated with' flood control. They would occur within the boundaries of the project, and but for the effort to curtail flooding the injuries would not have happened. Yet they would have nothing to do with management of flood waters, and it is hard to conceive that they are 'damage from or by floods or flood waters' within the scope of 702c.' \" Fryman v. United States, 901 F.2d 79, 81 (CA7 1990). More to the point, such an approach is also inconsistent with the statutory language. See infra, at 9.~      ~      ~        6~         \"Other circuits recognize that such a sweeping grant of immunity makes little sense in light of the text and purpose of the Act.\" Cantrell v. United States Dept. of Army Corps of Engineers, 89 F.3d 268, 271 (CA6 1996). See also Fryman, 901 F.2d, at 81 (\"James was so broadly written that it cannot be applied literally\").~      ~      ~        7~         In addition to concluding that the word \"damage\" includes personal injury and death, the Court also rejected the previously arguable propositions that the Federal Government's subsequent waiver of sovereign immunity in the Federal Tort Claims Act had impliedly repealed 702c; and that the immunity applied only to the flood control on the Mississippi River authorized by the 1928 Act.~      ~      ~        8~         The Chowchilla flows in a westerly direction into the San Joaquin, which in turn flows in a northwesterly direction at that point.~      ~      ~        9~         In some exceptional circumstances, irrigation contractors may be obligated to buy Class 2 water at a particular time. However, contractors still pay for the water, regardless of the potential inconvenience with respect to the timing or date of delivery.~      ~    ~    ",

Readers are requested to notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D. C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.JAMES F. LEWIS, PETITIONERv.LEWIS  CLARK MARINE, INC.~    No. 99-1331.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued November 29, 2000~    Decided February 21, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      Petitioner sued respondent in an Illinois County Court for personal injuries he suffered while working on respondent's ship. He did not request a jury trial. In anticipation of his suit, respondent had filed a complaint for exoneration from, or limitation of, liability in Federal District Court pursuant to the Limitation of Liability Act (Limitation Act or Act). Following the procedure for limitation actions set forth in Supplemental Admiralty and Maritime Claims Rule F, the court approved a surety bond representing respondent's interest in the vessel, ordered that any claim related to the incident be filed with the court within a specified period, and enjoined the filing or prosecution of any suits related to the incident. Petitioner, inter alia, moved to dissolve the restraining order, stating that he was the only claimant, waiving any res judicata claim concerning limited liability from a state court judgment, stipulating that respondent could relitigate limited liability issues in the District Court, and stipulating that his claim's value was less than the value of the limitation fund. The District Court recognized that federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a vessel owner is entitled to limited liability, but also recognized that the statute conferring exclusive jurisdiction over admiralty and maritime suits to federal courts saves to suitors \"all other remedies to which they are other wise entitled.\" 28 U.S.C.  1333(1). The court found two exceptions to exclusive federal jurisdiction under which a claimant may litigate his claim in state court-where the limitation fund's value exceeds the total value of all claims asserted against the vessel owner, and where there is a single claimant. The court dissolved the injunction because petitioner met the first and, probably, second exceptions, and retained jurisdiction over the limitation action to protect the vessel owner's right should the state proceedings necessitate further federal court proceedings. In holding that the District Court abused its discretion in dissolving the injunction, the Eighth Circuit found that respondent had a right to seek exoneration from, not mere limitation of, liability in federal court; that because petitioner did not request a jury trial, he had not sought a saved remedy in state court; and that because there was no conflict between the saving to suitors clause and the Limitation Act here, there was no basis for dissolving the injunction.~      Held: Because state courts may adjudicate claims like petitioner's against vessel owners so long as the owner's right to seek limitation of liability is protected, the Eighth Circuit erred in reversing the District Court's decision to dissolve the injunction. Pp. 5-17.~      (a) Section 1333(1)'s saving to suitors clause preserves common law remedies and concurrent state court jurisdiction over some admiralty and maritime claims. Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co., 264 U.S. 109, 123-124. The Limitation Act allows a vessel owner to limit liability for damage or injury, occasioned without the owner's privity or knowledge, to the value of the vessel or the owner's interest in the vessel. Potential tension exists between the saving to suitors clause and the Limitation Act because one gives suitors the right to a choice of remedies while the other gives vessel owners the right to seek limited liability in federal court. Claimants generally have been permitted to proceed with their claims in state court where there is only a single claimant, see Langnes v. Green, 282 U.S. 531, or where the total claims do not exceed the value of the limitation fund, see Lake Tankers Corp. v. Henn, 354 U.S. 147. Pp. 5-13.~      (b) The District Court properly exercised its discretion in dissolving the injunction here. Guided by this Court's cases, it attempted to reconcile petitioner's right to his remedy under the saving to suitors clause with respondent's right to seek limited liability under the Limitation Act. It dissolved the injunction after concluding that respondent's right would be adequately protected by petitioner's stipulations and by the court's decision to stay the Limitation Act proceedings pending state court proceedings. The Eighth Circuit misapprehended this Court's decisions in holding that the injunction should not have been dissolved. The Eighth Circuit erred in holding that the Limitation Act grants vessel owners a right to obtain exoneration of liability where limitation of liability is not at issue. By its own terms the Act protects the owners' right to limit their liability to the vessel's value. Here, the District Court concluded that petitioner's stipulations would protect the owner's right to seek limited liability in federal court, and, out of an abundance of caution, it stayed the limitation proceedings. Nothing more was required to protect respondent's Limitation Act rights. Having satisfied itself that the vessel owner's right to seek limitation would be protected, the decision to dissolve the injunction was well within the District Court's discretion. The Eighth Circuit also erred in finding that petitioner's failure to demand a jury trial in state court meant that he had no saved remedy there. The saving to suitors clause protects all remedies, of which trial by jury is an obvious, but not exclusive, example. In sum, this Court's case law makes clear that state courts, with all of their remedies, may adjudicate claims like petitioner's against vessel owners so long as the vessel owner's right to seek limitation of liability is protected. Pp. 13-17. 196 F.3d 900, reversed and remanded.~      CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT~      O'Connor, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      This case concerns a seaman's ability to sue a vessel owner in state court for personal injuries sustained aboard a vessel. Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over admiralty and maritime claims, but the jurisdictional statute \"sav[es] to suitors in all cases all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled.\" 28 U.S.C.  1333(1). Another statute grants vessel owners the right to seek limited liability in federal court for claims of damage aboard their vessels. 46 U.S.C. App. 181 et seq. In this case, the District Court, after conducting proceedings to preserve the vessel owner's right to seek limited liability, dissolved the injunction that prevented the seaman from litigating his personal injury claims in state court. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the vessel owner had a right to contest liability in federal court, and that the seaman did not have a saved remedy in state court. The question presented is whether the District Court abused its discretion in dissolving the injunction.~    ~    ~      2~      * Petitioner, James F. Lewis, worked as a deckhand aboard the M/V Karen Michelle, owned by respondent, Lewis  Clark Marine, Inc. Petitioner claims that on March 17, 1998, he was injured aboard the M/V Karen Michelle when he tripped over a wire and hurt his back. App. 12. In April 1998, petitioner sued respondent in the Circuit Court of Madison County, Illinois. Petitioner claimed negligence under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. App. 688, unseaworthiness, and maintenance and cure. A Jones Act claim is an in personam action for a seaman who suffers injury in the course of employment due to negligence of his employer, the vessel owner, or crew members. Ibid.; Plamals v. S. S. \"Pinar Del Rio,\" 277 U.S. 151, 155-156 (1928). Unseaworthiness is a claim under general maritime law based on the vessel owner's duty to ensure that the vessel is reasonably fit to be at sea. See generally Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, Inc., 362 U.S. 539, 550 (1960). A claim for maintenance and cure concerns the vessel owner's obligation to provide food, lodging, and medical services to a seaman injured while serving the ship. See generally Calmar S. S. Corp. v. Taylor, 303 U.S. 525, 527-528 (1938). Petitioner did not demand a jury trial in state court.~    ~    ~      3~      In anticipation of petitioner's suit, respondent had filed a complaint for exoneration from, or limitation of, liability in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri pursuant to the Limitation of Liability Act (Limitation Act or Act), 46 U.S.C. App. 181 et seq. The District Court followed the procedure for a limitation action provided in Supplemental Admiralty and Maritime Claims Rule F. The court entered an order approving a surety bond of $450,000, representing respondent's interest in the vessel. The court ordered that any person with a claim for the events of March 17, 1998, file a claim with the court within a specified period. The court then enjoined the filing or prosecution of any suits against respondent related to the incident on March 17, 1998. App. 30-33.~    ~    ~      4~      Petitioner filed an answer to respondent's complaint, a claim for damages for injury, and a motion to dissolve the restraining order. Petitioner averred that he was the sole claimant concerning the events of March 17, 1998. He waived any claim of res judicata concerning limited liability based on a state court judgment; he stipulated that respondent could relitigate issues relating to the limitation of liability in District Court. Id., at 72. Petitioner later stipulated that the value of his claim was less than the value of the limitation fund, id., at 102, recanting his earlier allegation that his claim exceeded the vessel's value.~    ~    ~      5~      The District Court dissolved the restraining order that prevented petitioner from proceeding with his cause of action in state court. In re Complaint of Lewis  Clark Marine, Inc., 31 F. Supp. 2d 1164 (ED Mo. 1998). The court recognized that federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a vessel owner is entitled to limited liability. The court also noted, however, that the statute that confers exclusive jurisdiction over admiralty and maritime claims to federal courts contains a clause that saves to suitors \"all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled.\" 28 U.S.C.  1333(1). The court reasoned that \"a tension exists between the exclusive jurisdiction vested in the admiralty courts to determine a vessel owner's right to limited liability and the savings to suitors clause.\" 31 F. Supp. 2d, at 1168.~    ~    ~      6~      The District Court found two exceptions to exclusive federal jurisdiction under which a claimant is allowed to litigate his claim in state court. The first is where the value of the limitation fund exceeds the total value of all claims asserted against the vessel owner. The second is where a single claimant brings an action against the vessel owner seeking damages in excess of the value of the vessel. The court concluded that it should dissolve the injunction in this case because petitioner met the limited fund exception and probably met the single claimant exception as well. Id., at 1169, and n. 3. The court decided to retain jurisdiction over the limitation action to protect the vessel owner's right to limitation in the event that the state proceedings necessitated further proceedings in federal court.~    ~    ~      7~      The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the District Court abused its discretion in dissolving the injunction. 196 F.3d 900 (1999). The Court of Appeals, like the District Court, recognized potential tension between the saving to suitors clause in the jurisdictional statute and the Limitation Act. The Court of Appeals, however, perceived no conflict between those provisions in the instant case. The Court of Appeals explained that a court must consider whether the vessel owner has the right to remain in federal court and whether the claimant is seeking a saved remedy in another forum. The court concluded that respondent had a right to seek exoneration from liability, not merely limitation of liability, in federal court. The court also concluded that because petitioner did not request a trial by jury, he had not sought a saved remedy in state court. The court determined that there was no substantive difference between the remedies afforded petitioner in state court and federal court. For these reasons, the court held that there was no basis for dissolving the injunction.~    ~    ~      8~      We granted certiorari, 530 U.S. 1202 (2000), to resolve a conflict between the Eighth Circuit's decision and the decisions of other Courts of Appeals. Compare 196 F.3d 900 (CA8 1999), with Kreta Shipping S. A. v. Preussag International Steel Corp., 192 F.3d 41 (CA2 1999), Beiswenger Enterprises Corp. v. Carletta, 86 F.3d 1032 (CA11 1996), and Linton v. Great Lakes Dredge  Dock Co., 964 F.2d 1480 (CA5 1992).~    ~    II~    ~      9~      * Article III, 2, of the United States Constitution vests federal courts with jurisdiction over all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. Section 9 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 codified this grant of exclusive original jurisdiction, but \"sav[ed] to suitors, in all cases, the right of a common law remedy, where the common law is competent to give it.\" Ch. 20, 9, 1 Stat. 77. In the intervening years, Congress has revised the language of the saving to suitors clause, but its substance has remained largely unchanged. See 28 U.S.C.  41(3) and 371 Third (1940 ed.) (\"saving to suitors in all cases the right of a common-law remedy where the common law is competent to give it\"); 28 U.S.C.  1333(1) (1946 ed., Supp. II) (\"saving to the libellant or petitioner in every case any other remedy to which he is otherwise entitled\"); Act of May 24, 1949, ch. 139, 79, 63 Stat. 101 (\"saving to suitors in all cases all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled\"). The jurisdictional statute now states that \"[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the States, of ... any civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction, saving to suitors in all cases all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled.\" 28 U.S.C.  1333(1) (emphasis added).~    ~    ~      10~      What the drafters of the Judiciary Act intended in creating the saving to suitors clause is not entirely clear and has been the subject of some debate. See, e.g., 1 J. Goebel, Antecedents and Beginnings to 1801, History of the Supreme Court of the United States 474 (1971). Compare Casto, The Origins of Federal Admiralty Jurisdiction in an Age of Privateers, Smugglers, and Pirates, 37 Am. J. Legal Hist. 117, 139-149 (1993), with Gutoff, Original Understandings and the Private Law Origins of the Federal Admiralty Jurisdiction, A Reply to Professor Casto, 30 J. Mar. L.  Com. 361, 387-390 (1999). This Court theorized that the saving to suitors clause was \"inserted, probably, from abundant caution, lest the exclusive terms in which the power is conferred on the District Courts might be deemed to have taken away the concurrent remedy which had before existed. This leaves the concurrent power where it stood at common law.\" New Jersey Steam Nav. Co. v. Merchants' Bank of Boston, 6 How. 344, 390 (1848).~    ~    ~      11~      In early cases we defined the limits of the clause. For instance, proceedings in rem were deemed outside the scope of the clause because an in rem action was not a common law remedy, but instead a proceeding under civil law. See, e.g., The Hine v. Trevor, 4 Wall. 555, 571-572 (1867); The Moses Taylor, 4 Wall. 411, 431 (1867). We later distinguished between the concept of rights and remedies. Chelentis v. Luckenbach S. S. Co., 247 U.S. 372, 383-384 (1918). In Chelentis, we held that maritime law governs a seaman's right to recovery against a vessel owner for his injuries aboard the vessel. We explained that \"[t]he distinction between rights and remedies is fundamental. A right is a well founded or acknowledged claim; a remedy is the means employed to enforce a right or redress an injury.\" Id., at 384.~    ~    ~      12~      In a subsequent case, the Court defined the saving to suitors clause as a grant to state courts of in personam jurisdiction, concurrent with admiralty courts. Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co., 264 U.S. 109, 123 (1924). We held enforceable an arbitration agreement between an owner of a steamship and a company that chartered the ship. We reasoned that agreements to arbitrate were valid under admiralty law, and that the State of New York had the power to confer on its courts the authority to compel parties to submit to arbitration. We explained that the state arbitration law merely provided a remedy in state court:~    ~    ~      13~      \"The 'right of a common law remedy,' so saved to suitors, does not ... include attempted changes by the States in the substantive admiralty law, but it does include all means other than proceedings in admiralty which may be employed to enforce the right or to redress the injury involved. It includes remedies in pais, as well as proceedings in court; judicial remedies conferred by statute, as well as those existing at the common law; remedies in equity, as well as those enforceable in a court of law.\" Id., at 123-124.~    ~    ~      14~      Thus, the saving to suitors clause preserves remedies and the concurrent jurisdiction of state courts over some admiralty and maritime claims. See also Madruga v. Superior Court of Cal., County of San Diego, 346 U.S. 556, 560-561 (1954); Steamboat Co. v. Chase, 16 Wall. 522, 533-534 (1873).~    ~    B~    ~      15~      Admiralty and maritime law includes a host of special rights, duties, rules, and procedures. See, e.g., 46 U.S.C. App. 721 et seq. (wrecks and salvage); 741 et seq. (suits in admiralty by or against vessels or cargoes of the United States); 46 U.S.C.  10101 et seq. (merchant seamen protection and relief). Among these provisions is the Limitation Act, 46 U.S.C. App. 181 et seq. The Act allows a vessel owner to limit liability for damage or injury, occasioned without the owner's privity or knowledge, to the value of the vessel or the owner's interest in the vessel. The central provision of the Act provides:~    ~    ~      16~      \"The liability of the owner of any vessel, whether American or foreign, for any embezzlement, loss, or destruction by any person of any property, goods, or merchandise shipped or put on board of such vessel, or for any loss, damage, or injury by collision, or for any act, matter, or thing, loss, damage, or forfeiture, done, occasioned, or incurred, without the privity or knowledge of such owner or owners, shall not, except in the cases provided for in subsection (b) of this section, exceed the amount or value of the interest of such owner in such vessel, and her freight then pending.\" 183(a). See also 183(b) (requiring supplemental fund for some vessels for personal injury and death claimants).~    ~    ~      17~      Congress passed the Limitation Act in 1851 \"to encourage ship-building and to induce capitalists to invest money in this branch of industry.\" Norwich Co. v. Wright, 13 Wall. 104, 121 (1872). See also British Transport Comm'n v. United States, 354 U.S. 129, 133-135 (1957); Just v. Chambers, 312 U.S. 383, 385 (1941). The Act also had the purpose of \"putting American shipping upon an equality with that of other maritime nations\" that had their own limitation acts. The Main v. Williams, 152 U.S. 122, 128 (1894). See also Norwich Co., supra, at 116-119 (discussing history of limitation acts in England, France, and the States that led to the passage of the Limitation Act).~    ~    ~      18~      The Act is not a model of clarity. See 2 T. Schoenbaum, Admiralty and Maritime Law 299 (2d ed. 1994) (\"Th[e] 1851 Act, badly drafted even by the standards of the time, continues in effect today\"). Having created a right to seek limited liability, Congress did not provide procedures for determining the entitlement. This Court did not have an opportunity to review the Act in detail until 20 years after its enactment. See Norwich Co., supra. Deeming the Act \"incapable of execution\" without further instructions to courts, id., at 123, we designed the procedures that govern a limitation action, and promulgated them the same Term, see Supplementary Rules of Practice in Admiralty, 13 Wall. xii-xiv. We later explained that the scheme \"was sketched in outline\" by the Act, and \"the regulation of details as to the form and modes of proceeding was left to be prescribed by judicial authority.\" Providence  New York S. S. Co. v. Hill Mfg. Co., 109 U.S. 578, 590 (1883).~    ~    ~      19~      The 1872 rules were \"intended to facilitate the proceedings of the owners of vessels for claiming the limitation of liability secured by the statute.\" The \"Benefactor,\" 103 U.S. 239, 244 (1880). Under the rules, a vessel owner seeking limitation of liability had to file a petition. The district court would obtain an appraisal of the vessel's value or the owner's interest in the vessel, and ensure that payment or some guarantee of payment was deposited with the court. The court would then order all claimants to appear. Supplemental Rule of Practice in Admiralty 54, 13 Wall. at xii-xiii. In the process of seeking limited liability, the owner was permitted to contest the fact of liability. Rule 56, 13 Wall., at xiii. The ability to contest liability relieved vessel owners of the \"very onerous\" English rule, which required vessel owners to confess liability in order to seek the benefit of limitation. The \"Benefactor,\" supra, at 243 (\"[T]his court, in preparing the rules of procedure for a limitation of liability, deemed it proper to allow a party seeking such limitation to contest any liability whatever\"). The claimants would then contest the vessel owner's claims for exoneration and limitation of liability. Rule 56, 13 Wall., at xiii. If the owner succeeded in its effort to limit liability, but was not exonerated, the court was responsible for distributing the fund deposited in the court among the claimants. Rule 55, 13 Wall., at xiii.~    ~    ~      20~      The procedure for a limitation action is now found in Supplemental Admiralty and Maritime Claims Rule F. Much like its predecessor provisions, Rule F sets forth the process for filing a complaint seeking exoneration from, or limitation of, liability. The district court secures the value of the vessel or owner's interest, marshals claims, and enjoins the prosecution of other actions with respect to the claims. In these proceedings, the court, sitting without a jury, adjudicates the claims. The court determines whether the vessel owner is liable and whether the owner may limit liability. The court then determines the validity of the claims, and if liability is limited, distributes the limited fund among the claimants.~    ~    C~    ~      21~      Some tension exists between the saving to suitors clause and the Limitation Act. One statute gives suitors the right to a choice of remedies, and the other statute gives vessel owners the right to seek limitation of liability in federal court. We confronted this tension in Langnes v. Green, 282 U.S. 531 (1931). The respondent in Langnes was employed on the petitioner's vessel. The employee sued the vessel owner in state court for $25,000 for personal injuries suffered aboard the vessel. The vessel owner later filed a petition for limitation of liability in Federal District Court. The District Court enjoined any further proceedings in state court and issued a notice that all claimants appear. The employee filed his claim in District Court. The parties stipulated that the vessel was worth no more than $5,000.~    ~    ~      22~      The employee sought dissolution of the injunction. He argued that the state court had jurisdiction over his claim, that he was the only possible claimant, that there was only one vessel owner, and therefore the vessel owner could claim the benefit of the Limitation Act by proper pleading in state court. The District Court denied the motion and proceeded to decide the merits, concluding that the vessel owner was not liable. The Court of Appeals reversed on the issue of limitation.~    ~    ~      23~      On review, this Court concluded that both courts erred in failing to recognize that the state court was competent to hear the employee's personal injury claim and the vessel owner's claim for limitation. In our view, the choice before the District Court was whether it should retain the limitation action and preserve the right of the vessel owner but destroy the right of the employee in state court to a common law remedy, or allow the action in state court to proceed and preserve the rights of both parties. We concluded that the latter course was just. We decided that the District Court should have dissolved the injunction and allowed the employee to proceed with his claim in state court, and retained jurisdiction over the petition for limitation of liability in the event that the state proceedings necessitated further proceedings in federal court. We explained that the District Court's decision is \"one of discretion in every case,\" and remanded for further proceedings. Id., at 544.~    ~    ~      24~      After our decision, the employee was permitted to pursue his claim in state court. See Ex parte Green, 286 U.S. 437 (1932). In those proceedings, notwithstanding this Court's recognition of the vessel owner's right to seek limitation of liability in federal court, the employee sought to litigate that issue in state court. We approved of the District Court's decision to enjoin any further proceedings in state court until the employee agreed to withdraw his submission on the issue of limited liability. Id., at 440.~    ~    ~      25~      We have also considered the conflict between the saving to suitors clause and the Limitation Act in a case where several claimants attempted to sue a vessel owner in state court. Lake Tankers Corp. v. Henn, 354 U.S. 147 (1957). A pleasure yacht, the Blackstone, capsized after a collision with a tug that was push-towing a barge, injuring several persons and killing one. Claimants sued the owner of the tug and barge in state court actions. The owner filed a petition for exoneration from, or limitation of, liability in federal court. The owner also filed a bond for the tug in the amount of approximately $119,000 and a bond for the barge in the amount of $165,000. The District Court enjoined other proceedings concerning the collision. Thereafter, the claimants made their demands for damages; the total claims were less than the amount of the two bonds. All claimants relinquished any right to damages in excess of that set forth in their claims. They further waived any claim of res judicata relating to the issue of the vessel owner's ability to limit liability. The District Court decided to dissolve the injunction because the total limitation fund exceeded the amount of the claims. The Court of Appeals affirmed.~    ~    ~      26~      We affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision. In examining the Limitation Act and its history, we found it \"crystal clear that the operation of the Act is directed at misfortunes at sea where the losses incurred exceed the value of the vessel and the pending freight.\" Id., at 151. Where the value of the vessel and the pending freight exceed the claims, however, there is no necessity for the maintenance of the action in federal court. Id., at 152. The stipulations, in addition to other restrictions on the state court proceedings, ensured \"beyond doubt that [the owner's] right of limitation under the Act was fully protected.\" Ibid. We explained that to expand the scope of exclusive jurisdiction to prevent the state court actions~    ~    ~      27~      \"would transform the Act from a protective instrument to an offensive weapon by which the shipowner could deprive suitors of their common-law rights, even where the limitation fund is known to be more than adequate to satisfy all demands upon it. The shipowner's right to limit liability is not so boundless. The Act is not one of immunity from liability but of limitation of it and we read no other privilege for the shipowner into its language over and above that granting him limited liability. In fact, the Congress not only created the limitation procedure for the primary purpose of apportioning the limitation fund among the claimants where that fund was inadequate to pay the claims in full, but it reserved to such suitors their common-law remedies.\" Id., at 152-153. Since these decisions, the Courts of Appeals have generally permitted claimants to proceed with their claims in state court where there is only a single claimant, as in Langnes, or where the total claims do not exceed the value of the limitation fund, as in Lake Tankers. See, e.g., Beiswenger Enterprises Corp. v. Carletta, 86 F.3d 1032 (CA11 1996); Linton v. Great Lakes Dredge  Dock Co., 964 F.2d 1480 (CA5 1992). See also Kreta Shipping S. A. v. Preussag International Steel Corp., 192 F.3d 41 (CA2 1999) (foreign forum).~    ~    III~    ~      28~      In the instant case, we believe that the District Court properly exercised its discretion in dissolving the injunction that prevented petitioner from pursuing his claims in state court. The District Court, guided by our prior cases, attempted to reconcile petitioner's right to his remedy under the saving to suitors clause with respondent's right to seek limited liability under the Limitation Act. The court dissolved the injunction against the state court proceedings after it concluded that respondent's right to seek limitation of liability would be adequately protected. Respondent's rights were protected by petitioner's stipulation that his claim did not exceed the limitation fund, petitioner's waiver of any defense of res judicata with respect to limitation of liability, and the District Court's decision to stay the Limitation Act proceedings pending state court proceedings.~    ~    ~      29~      The Eighth Circuit held that the District Court should not have dissolved the injunction without first \"finding ... actual statutory conflict between the Limitation Act and the 'saving to suitors' clause in the case at bar.\" 196 F.3d, at 906. The Court of Appeals concluded that there was no conflict here because respondent had a right to seek exoneration from liability in federal court, and petitioner did not have a saved remedy under the saving to suitors clause. That reasoning misapprehends this Court's prior decisions.~    ~    ~      30~      In this case, there was a conflict between the saving to suitors clause and the Limitation Act. Petitioner sued respondent in state court; under the saving to suitors clause, that court had jurisdiction to hear his claims. Respondent sought limited liability for petitioner's claims in federal court; the Limitation Act granted the federal court jurisdiction over that action. Both parties selected legitimate forums for their claims, and therein lies the conflict. Had petitioner sought to institute in rem proceedings against respondent in state court, that court would have lacked jurisdiction because the saving to suitors clause does not reach actions in rem. Similarly, had respondent sought limited liability for payment of wages in federal court, that court would not have had jurisdiction under the Limitation Act because claims for wages due employees are not covered. 46 U.S.C. App. 189. See also In re East River Towing Co., 266 U.S. 355, 367 (1924). Here, however, there appears to have been no obstacle to each party pursuing its claim in the forum of its choice, except the competing action.~    ~    ~      31~      In deciding that the case should proceed in federal court, the Court of Appeals relied on two flawed premises: that the Limitation Act grants vessel owners a right to obtain exoneration from liability in federal court where limitation of liability is not at issue, and that the saving to suitors clause reserves to claimants only the right to receive a jury trial.~    ~    ~      32~      By its own terms, the Limitation Act protects the right of vessel owners to limit their liability to the value of the vessel, provided that the events or circumstances giving rise to the damage occurred without the vessel owner's privity or knowledge. The Act was designed to encourage investment and protect vessel owners from unlimited exposure to liability. We have also made clear, however, that the scope of exclusive federal jurisdiction is proportional to the federal interest in protecting the vessel owner's right to seek limitation of liability. See Lake Tankers, 354 U.S., at 153. We have explained that \"[t]he Act is not one of immunity from liability but of limitation of it.\" Id., at 152. We see no reason to revisit that conclusion and decline respondent's invitation to expand the scope of the Act.~    ~    ~      33~      In construing the Limitation Act, this Court long ago determined that vessel owners may contest liability in the process of seeking limited liability, and we promulgated rules to that effect pursuant to our \"power to regulate ... proceedings.\" The \"Benefactor,\" 103 U.S., at 244; Supplemental Rule of Practice in Admiralty 56, 13 Wall., at xiii; Supplemental Admiralty and Maritime Claims Rule F(2). Thus, we agree with respondent that a vessel owner need not confess liability in order to seek limitation under the Act. The Act and the rules of practice, however, do not create a freestanding right to exoneration from liability in circumstances where limitation of liability is not at issue. In this case, petitioner stipulated that his claim for damages would not exceed the value of the vessel and waived any claim of res judicata from the state court action concerning issues bearing on the limitation of liability. The District Court concluded that these stipulations would protect the vessel owner's right to seek limited liability in federal court. Then, out of an \"abundance of caution,\" the court stayed the limitation proceedings so that it could act if the state court proceedings jeopardized the vessel owner's rights under the Limitation Act. 31 F. Supp. 2d, at 1170-1171. We believe nothing more was required to protect respondent's right to seek a limitation of liability.~    ~    ~      34~      The district courts have jurisdiction over actions arising under the Limitation Act, and they have discretion to stay or dismiss Limitation Act proceedings to allow a suitor to pursue his claims in state court. If the district court concludes that the vessel owner's right to limitation will not be adequately protected-where for example a group of claimants cannot agree on appropriate stipulations or there is uncertainty concerning the adequacy of the fund or the number of claims-the court may proceed to adjudicate the merits, deciding the issues of liability and limitation. See, e.g., Lake Tankers, supra, at 152; Port Arthur Towing Co. v. John W. Towing, Inc., 42 F.3d 312, 314 (CA5 1995). But where, as here, the District Court satisfies itself that a vessel owner's right to seek limitation will be protected, the decision to dissolve the injunction is well within the court's discretion.~    ~    ~      35~      The Court of Appeals reasoned that the District Court also erred in dissolving the injunction because petitioner had no saved remedy in state court. The Court of Appeals apparently treated as dispositive petitioner's failure to demand a jury trial in state court. The jurisdictional statute, however, reserves to suitors \"all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled.\" 28 U.S.C.  1333(1). Tracing the development of the clause since the Judiciary Act of 1789, it appears that the clause was designed to protect remedies available at common law. See, e.g, The Hine v. Trevor, 4 Wall. 555 (1867). We later explained that the clause extends to \"all means other than proceedings in admiralty which may be employed to enforce the right or to redress the injury involved.\" Red Cross Line, 264 U.S., at 124. Trial by jury is an obvious, but not exclusive, example of the remedies available to suitors. See Lake Tankers, supra, at 153; Red Cross Line, supra, at 123-125.~    ~    ~      36~      The Court of Appeals concluded that forum choice could not be a saved remedy under the saving to suitors clause because a claimant does not have the ability to control the forum in which his claim will be heard. 192 F.3d, at 909. The prospect that a vessel owner may remove a state court action to federal court, however, does not limit a claimant's forum choice under the saving to suitors clause any more than other litigants' forum choices may be limited. We have previously refused to hold that admiralty claims, such as a limitation claim, fall within the scope of federal question jurisdiction out of concern that saving to suitors actions in state court would be removed to federal court and undermine the claimant's choice of forum. Romero v. International Terminal Operating Co., 358 U.S. 354, 371-372 (1959). We explained that to define admiralty jurisdiction as federal question jurisdiction would be a \"destructive oversimplification of the highly intricate interplay of the States and the National Government in their regulation of maritime commerce.\" Id., at 373. Moreover, in this case respondent raised a Jones Act claim, which is not subject to removal to federal court even in the event of diversity of the parties. See 28 U.S.C.  1445(a) (incorporated by reference into the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. App. 688(a)). Respondent's arguments to limit and enumerate the saved remedies under the saving to suitors clause must fail in view of the consistent recognition by Congress and this Court that both state and federal courts may be proper forums for adjudicating claims such as petitioner's.~    ~    ~      37~      In sum, this Court's case law makes clear that state courts, with all of their remedies, may adjudicate claims like petitioner's against vessel owners so long as the vessel owner's right to seek limitation of liability is protected. Respondent seeks to invert that rule, making run of the mill personal injury actions involving vessels a matter of exclusive federal jurisdiction except where the claimant happens to seek a jury trial. We reject that proposal and hold that the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the District Court's decision to dissolve the injunction.~    ~    ~      38~      The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      39~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ",

Pursuant to 109(d)(1), the Administrator in 1997 revised the ozone and particulate matter NAAQS. Respondents in No. 99-1257, private parties and several States (hereinafter respondents), challenged the revised NAAQS on several grounds. The District of Columbia Circuit found that, under the Administrator's interpretation, 109(b)(1)-which instructs the EPA to set standards \"the attainment and maintenance of which ... are requisite to protect the public health\" with \"an adequate margin of safety\"-delegated legislative power to the Administrator in contravention of the Federal Constitution, and it remanded the NAAQS to the EPA. The Court of Appeals also declined to depart from its rule that the EPA may not consider implementation costs in setting the NAAQS. And it held that, although certain implementation provisions for the ozone NAAQS contained in Part D, Subpart 2, of Title I of the CAA did not prevent the EPA from revising the ozone standard and designating certain areas as \"nonattainment areas,\" those provisions, rather than more general provisions contained in Subpart 1, constrained the implementation of the new ozone NAAQS. The court rejected the EPA's argument that it lacked jurisdiction to reach the implementation question because there had been no \"final\" implementation action.~      Held:  1. Section 109(b) does not permit the Administrator to consider implementation costs in setting NAAQS. Because the CAA often expressly grants the EPA the authority to consider implementation costs, a provision for costs will not be inferred from its ambiguous provisions. Union Elec. Co. v. EPA, 427 U.S. 246, 257, and n. 5. And since 109(b)(1) is the engine that drives nearly all of Title I of the CAA, the textual commitment of costs must be clear; Congress does not alter a regulatory scheme's fundamental details in vague terms or ancillary provisions, see MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone  Telegraph Co., 512 U.S. 218, 231. Respondents' arguments founder upon this principle. It is implausible that 109(b)(1)'s modest words \"adequate margin\" and \"requisite\" give the EPA the power to determine whether implementation costs should moderate national air quality standards. Cf. ibid. And the cost factor is both so indirectly related to public health and so full of potential for canceling the conclusions drawn from direct health effects that it would have been expressly mentioned in 108 and 109 had Congress meant it to be considered. Other CAA provisions, which do require cost data, have no bearing upon whether costs are to be taken into account in setting the NAAQS. Because the text of 109(b)(1) in its context is clear, the canon of construing texts to avoid serious constitutional problems is not applicable. See, e.g., Miller v. French, 530 U.S. 327, 341. Pp. 4-11.~      2. Section 109(b)(1) does not delegate legislative power to the EPA. When conferring decisionmaking authority upon agencies, Congress must lay down an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to act is directed to conform. J. W. Hampton, Jr.,  Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 409. An agency cannot cure an unlawful delegation of legislative power by adopting in its discretion a limiting construction of the statute. The limits that 109(b)(1) imposes on the EPA's discretion are strikingly similar to the ones approved in, e.g., Touby v. United States, 500 U.S. 160, and the scope of discretion that 109(b)(1) allows is well within the outer limits of the Court's nondelegation precedents, see, e.g., Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388. Statutes need not provide a determinate criterion for saying how much of a regulated harm is too much to avoid delegating legislative power. Pp. 11-15.~      3. The Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to consider the implementation issue under 307 of the CAA. The implementation policy constitutes final agency action under 307 of the CAA because it marked the consummation of the EPA's decisionmaking process, see Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154. The decision is also ripe for review. The question is purely one of statutory interpretation that would not benefit from further factual development, see Ohio Forestry Assn., Inc. v. Sierra Club, 523 U.S. 726, 733; review will not interfere with further administrative development; and the hardship on respondent States in developing state implementation plans satisfies the CAA's special judicial-review provision permitting preenforcement review, see id., at 737. The implementation issue was also fairly included within the challenges to the final ozone rule that were before the Court of Appeals, which all parties agree is final agency action ripe for review. Pp. 16-20.~      4. The implementation policy is unlawful. Under Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, if the statute resolves the question whether Subpart 1 or Subpart 2 applies to revised ozone NAAQS, that ends the matter; but if the statute is ambiguous, the Court must defer to a reasonable agency interpretation. Here, the statute is ambiguous concerning the interaction between Subpart 1 and Subpart 2, but the Court cannot defer to the EPA's interpretation, which would render Subpart 2's carefully designed restrictions on EPA discretion nugatory once a new ozone NAAQS has been promulgated. The principal distinction between the subparts is that Subpart 2 eliminates regulatory discretion allowed by Subpart 1. The EPA may not construe the statute in a way that completely nullifies textually applicable provisions meant to limit its discretion. In addition, although Subpart 2 was obviously written to govern implementation for some time into the future, nothing in the EPA's interpretation would have prevented the agency from aborting the subpart the day after it was enacted. It is left to the EPA to develop a reasonable interpretation of the nonattainment implementation provisions insofar as they apply to revised ozone NAAQS.

Whitman, Administrator of Environmental Protection Agency, et al., also on certiorari to the same court.~        ~      ~      ON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT~      Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, Parts I and IV of which were unanimous, Part II of which was joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and Stevens, O'Connor, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, and Ginsburg, JJ., and Part III of which was joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor, Kennedy, Thomas, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ. Thomas, J., filed a concurring opinion. Stevens, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, in which Souter, J., joined. Breyer, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      These cases present the following questions: (1) Whether 109(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) delegates legislative power to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). (2) Whether the Administrator may consider the costs of implementation in setting national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) under 109(b)(1). (3) Whether the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to review the EPA's interpretation of Part D of~    ~    ~      2~      Title I of the CAA, 42 U.S.C.  7501-7515, with respect to implementing the revised ozone NAAQS. (4) If so, whether the EPA's interpretation of that part was permissible.~    ~    ~      3~      * Section 109(a) of the CAA, as added, 84 Stat. 1679, and amended, 42 U.S.C.  7409(a), requires the Administrator of the EPA to promulgate NAAQS for each air pollutant for which \"air quality criteria\" have been issued under 108, 42 U.S.C.  7408. Once a NAAQS has been promulgated, the Administrator must review the standard (and the criteria on which it is based) \"at five-year intervals\" and make \"such revisions ... as may be appropriate.\" CAA 109(d)(1), 42 U.S.C.  7409(d)(1). These cases arose when, on July 18, 1997, the Administrator revised the NAAQS for particulate matter (PM) and ozone. See NAAQS for Particulate Matter, 62 Fed. Reg. 38652 (codified in 40 CFR  50.7 (1999)); NAAQS for Ozone, id., at 38856 (codified in 40 CFR 50.9, 50.10 (1999)). American Trucking Associations, Inc., and its co-respondents in No. 99-1257-which include, in addition to other private companies, the States of Michigan, Ohio, and West Virginia-challenged the new standards in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  7607(b)(1).~    ~    ~      4~      The District of Columbia Circuit accepted some of the challenges and rejected others. It agreed with the No. 99-1257 respondents (hereinafter respondents) that 109(b)(1) delegated legislative power to the Administrator in contravention of the United States Constitution, Art. I, 1, because it found that the EPA had interpreted the statute to provide no \"intelligible principle\" to guide the agency's exercise of authority. American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. EPA, 175 F.3d 1027, 1034 (1999). The court thought, however, that the EPA could perhaps avoid the unconstitutional delegation by adopting a restrictive construction of 109(b)(1), so instead of declaring the section unconstitutional the court remanded the NAAQS to the agency. Id., at 1038. (On this delegation point, Judge Tatel dissented, finding the statute constitutional as written. Id., at 1057.) On the second issue that the Court of Appeals addressed, it unanimously rejected respondents' argument that the court should depart from the rule of Lead Industries Assn., Inc. v. EPA, 647 F.2d 1130, 1148 (CADC 1980), that the EPA may not consider the cost of implementing a NAAQS in setting the initial standard.~    ~    ~      5~      It also rejected respondents' argument that the implementation provisions for ozone found in Part D, Subpart 2, of Title I of the CAA, 42 U.S.C.  7511-7511f, were so tied to the existing ozone standard that the EPA lacked the power to revise the standard. The court held that although Subpart 2 constrained the agency's method of implementing the new standard, 175 F.3d, at 1050, it did not prevent the EPA from revising the standard and designating areas of the country as \"nonattainment areas,\" see 42 U.S.C.  7407(d)(1), by reference to it, 175 F.3d, at 1047-1048. On the EPA's petition for rehearing, the panel adhered to its position on these points, and unanimously rejected the EPA's new argument that the court lacked jurisdiction to reach the implementation question because there had been no \"final\" implementation action. American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. EPA, 195 F.3d 4 (CADC 1999). The Court of Appeals denied the EPA's suggestion for rehearing en banc, with five judges dissenting. Id., at 13.~    ~    ~      6~      The Administrator and the EPA petitioned this Court for review of the first, third, and fourth questions described in the first paragraph of this opinion. Respondents conditionally cross-petitioned for review of the second question. We granted certiorari on both petitions, 529 U.S. 1129 (2000); 530 U.S. 1202 (2000), and scheduled the cases for argument in tandem. We have now consolidated the cases for purposes of decision.~    ~    II~    ~      7~      In Lead Industries Assn., Inc. v. EPA, supra, at 1148, the District of Columbia Circuit held that \"economic considerations [may] play no part in the promulgation of ambient air quality standards under Section 109\" of the CAA. In the present cases, the court adhered to that holding, 175 F.3d, at 1040-1041, as it had done on many other occasions. See, e.g., American Lung Assn. v. EPA, 134 F.3d 388, 389 (1998); NRDC v. Administrator, EPA, 902 F.2d 962, 973 (1990), vacated in part on other grounds, NRDC v. EPA, 921 F.2d 326 (CADC 1991); American Petroleum Institute v. Costle, 665 F.2d 1176, 1185 (1981). Respondents argue that these decisions are incorrect. We disagree; and since the first step in assessing whether a statute delegates legislative power is to determine what authority the statute confers, we address that issue of interpretation first and reach respondents' constitutional arguments in Part III, infra.~    ~    ~      8~      Section 109(b)(1) instructs the EPA to set primary ambient air quality standards \"the attainment and maintenance of which ... are requisite to protect the public health\" with \"an adequate margin of safety.\" 42 U.S.C.  7409(b)(1). Were it not for the hundreds of pages of briefing respondents have submitted on the issue, one would have thought it fairly clear that this text does not permit the EPA to consider costs in setting the standards. The language, as one scholar has noted, \"is absolute.\" D. Currie, Air Pollution: Federal Law and Analysis 4-15 (1981). The EPA, \"based on\" the information about health effects contained in the technical \"criteria\" documents compiled under 108(a)(2), 42 U.S.C.  7408(a)(2), is to identify the maximum airborne concentration of a pollutant that the public health can tolerate, decrease the concentration to provide an \"adequate\" margin of safety, and set the standard at that level. Nowhere are the costs of achieving such a standard made part of that initial calculation.~    ~    ~      9~      Against this most natural of readings, respondents make a lengthy, spirited, but ultimately unsuccessful attack. They begin with the object of 109(b)(1)'s focus, the \"public health.\" When the term first appeared in federal clean air legislation-in the Act of July 14, 1955 (1955 Act), 69 Stat. 322, which expressed \"recognition of the dangers to the public health\" from air pollution-its ordinary meaning was \"[t]he health of the community.\" Webster's New International Dictionary 2005 (2d ed. 1950). Respondents argue, however, that 109(b)(1), as added by the Clean Air Amendments of 1970 (1970 Act), 84 Stat. 1676, meant to use the term's secondary meaning: \"[t]he ways and means of conserving the health of the members of a community, as by preventive medicine, organized care of the sick, etc.\" Ibid. Words that can have more than one meaning are given content, however, by their surroundings, FDA v. Brown  Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 132-133 (2000); Jones v. United States, 527 U.S. 373, 389 (1999), and in the context of 109(b)(1) this second definition makes no sense. Congress could not have meant to instruct the Administrator to set NAAQS at a level \"requisite to protect\" \"the art and science dealing with the protection and improvement of community health.\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1836 (1981). We therefore revert to the primary definition of the term: the health of the public.~    ~    ~      10~      Even so, respondents argue, many more factors than air pollution affect public health. In particular, the economic cost of implementing a very stringent standard might produce health losses sufficient to offset the health gains achieved in cleaning the air-for example, by closing down whole industries and thereby impoverishing the workers and consumers dependent upon those industries. That is unquestionably true, and Congress was unquestionably aware of it. Thus, Congress had commissioned in the Air Quality Act of 1967 (1967 Act) \"a detailed estimate of the cost of carrying out the provisions of this Act; a comprehensive study of the cost of program implementation by affected units of government; and a comprehensive study of the economic impact of air quality standards on the Nation's industries, communities, and other contributing sources of pollution.\" 2, 81 Stat. 505. The 1970 Congress, armed with the results of this study, see The Cost of Clean Air, S. Doc. No. 91-40 (1969) (publishing the results of the study), not only anticipated that compliance costs could injure the public health, but provided for that precise exigency. Section 110(f)(1) of the CAA permitted the Administrator to waive the compliance deadline for stationary sources if, inter alia, sufficient control measures were simply unavailable and \"the continued operation of such sources is essential ... to the public health or welfare.\" 84 Stat. 1683 (emphasis added). Other provisions explicitly permitted or required economic costs to be taken into account in implementing the air quality standards. Section 111(b)(1)(B), for example, commanded the Administrator to set \"standards of performance\" for certain new sources of emissions that as specified in 111(a)(1) were to \"reflec[t] the degree of emission limitation achievable through the application of the best system of emission reduction which (taking into account the cost of achieving such reduction) the Administrator determines has been adequately demonstrated.\" Section 202(a)(2) prescribed that emissions standards for automobiles could take effect only \"after such period as the Administrator finds necessary to permit the development and application of the requisite technology, giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance within such period.\" 84 Stat. 1690. See also 202(b)(5)(C) (similar limitation for interim standards); 211(c)(2) (similar limitation for fuel additives); 231(b) (similar limitation for implementation of aircraft emission standards). Subsequent amendments to the CAA have added many more provisions directing, in explicit language, that the Administrator consider costs in performing various duties. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C.  7545(k)(1) (reformulate gasoline to \"require the greatest reduction in emissions ... taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emissions reductions\"); 7547(a)(3) (emission reduction for nonroad vehicles to be set \"giving appropriate consideration to the cost\" of the standards). We have therefore refused to find implicit in ambiguous sections of the CAA an authorization to consider costs that has elsewhere, and so often, been expressly granted. See Union Elec. Co. v. EPA, 427 U.S. 246, 257, and n. 5 (1976). Cf. General Motors Corp. v. United States, 496 U.S. 530, 538, 541 (1990) (refusing to infer in certain provisions of the CAA deadlines and enforcement limitations that had been expressly imposed elsewhere).~    ~    ~      11~      Accordingly, to prevail in their present challenge, respondents must show a textual commitment of authority to the EPA to consider costs in setting NAAQS under 109(b)(1). And because 109(b)(1) and the NAAQS for which it provides are the engine that drives nearly all of Title I of the CAA, 42 U.S.C.  7401-7515, that textual commitment must be a clear one. Congress, we have held, does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions-it does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes. See MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone  Telegraph Co., 512 U.S. 218, 231 (1994); FDA v. Brown  Williamson Tobacco Corp., supra, at 159-160. Respondents' textual arguments ultimately founder upon this principle.~    ~    ~      12~      Their first claim is that 109(b)(1)'s terms \"adequate margin\" and \"requisite\" leave room to pad health effects with cost concerns. Just as we found it \"highly unlikely that Congress would leave the determination of whether an industry will be entirely, or even substantially, rate-regulated to agency discretion-and even more unlikely that it would achieve that through such a subtle device as permission to 'modify' rate-filing requirements,\" MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone  Telegraph Co., supra, at 231, so also we find it implausible that Congress would give to the EPA through these modest words the power to determine whether implementation costs should moderate national air quality standards. Accord Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576, 590, n. (2000) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\"The implausibility of Congress's leaving a highly significant issue unaddressed (and thus 'delegating' its resolution to the administering agency) is assuredly one of the factors to be considered in determining whether there is ambiguity\" (emphasis deleted)).1~    ~    ~      13~      The same defect inheres in respondents' next two arguments: that while the Administrator's judgment about what is requisite to protect the public health must be \"based on [the] criteria\" documents developed under 108(a)(2), see 109(b)(1), it need not be based solely on those criteria; and that those criteria themselves, while they must include \"effects on public health or welfare which may be expected from the presence of such pollutant in the ambient air,\" are not necessarily limited to those effects. Even if we were to concede those premises, we still would not conclude that one of the unenumerated factors that the agency can consider in developing and applying the criteria is cost of implementation. That factor is both so indirectly related to public health and so full of potential for canceling the conclusions drawn from direct health effects that it would surely have been expressly mentioned in 108 and 109 had Congress meant it to be considered. Yet while those provisions describe in detail how the health effects of pollutants in the ambient air are to be calculated and given effect, see 108(a)(2), they say not a word about costs.~    ~    ~      14~      Respondents point, finally, to a number of provisions in the CAA that do require attainment cost data to be generated. Section 108(b)(1), for example, instructs the Administrator to \"issue to the States,\" simultaneously with the criteria documents, \"information on air pollution control techniques, which information shall include data relating to the cost of installation and operation.\" 42 U.S.C.  7408(b)(l). And 109(d)(2)(C)(iv) requires the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee to \"advise the Administrator of any adverse public health, welfare, social, economic, or energy effects which may result from various strategies for attainment and maintenance\" of NAAQS.2 42 U.S.C.  7409(d)(2)(C)(iv). Respondents argue that these provisions make no sense unless costs are to be considered in setting the NAAQS. That is not so. These provisions enable the Administrator to assist the States in carrying out their statutory role as primary implementers of the NAAQS. It is to the States that the Act assigns initial and primary responsibility for deciding what emissions reductions will be required from which sources. See 42 U.S.C.  7407(a), 7410 (giving States the duty of developing implementation plans). It would be impossible to perform that task intelligently without considering which abatement technologies are most efficient, and most economically feasible-which is why we have said that \"the most important forum for consideration of claims of economic and technological infeasibility is before the state agency formulating the implementation plan,\" Union Elec. Co. v. EPA, 427 U.S., at 266.~    ~    ~      15~      Thus, federal clean air legislation has, from the very beginning, directed federal agencies to develop and transmit implementation data, including cost data, to the States. See 1955 Act, 2(b), 69 Stat. 322; Clean Air Act of 1963, amending 3(a), (b) of the CAA, 77 Stat. 394; 1967 Act, 103(a)-(d), 104, 107(c), 81 Stat. 486-488. That Congress chose to carry forward this research program to assist States in choosing the means through which they would implement the standards is perfectly sensible, and has no bearing upon whether cost considerations are to be taken into account in formulating the standards.3~    ~    ~      16~      It should be clear from what we have said that the canon requiring texts to be so construed as to avoid serious constitutional problems has no application here. No matter how severe the constitutional doubt, courts may choose only between reasonably available interpretations of a text. See, e.g., Miller v. French, 530 U.S. 327, 341 (2000); Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998). The text of 109(b), interpreted in its statutory and historical context and with appreciation for its importance to the CAA as a whole, unambiguously bars cost considerations from the NAAQS-setting process, and thus ends the matter for us as well as the EPA.4 We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals on this point.~    ~    III~    ~      17~      Section 109(b)(1) of the CAA instructs the EPA to set \"ambient air quality standards the attainment and maintenance of which in the judgment of the Administrator, based on [the] criteria [documents of 108] and allowing an adequate margin of safety, are requisite to protect the public health.\" 42 U.S.C.  7409(b)(1). The Court of Appeals held that this section as interpreted by the Administrator did not provide an \"intelligible principle\" to guide the EPA's exercise of authority in setting NAAQS. \"[The] EPA,\" it said, \"lack[ed] any determinate criteria for drawing lines. It has failed to state intelligibly how much is too much.\" 175 F.3d, at 1034. The court hence found that the EPA's interpretation (but not the statute itself) violated the nondelegation doctrine. Id., at 1038. We disagree.~    ~    ~      18~      In a delegation challenge, the constitutional question is whether the statute has delegated legislative power to the agency. Article I, 1, of the Constitution vests \"[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted ... in a Congress of the United States.\" This text permits no delegation of those powers, Loving v. United States, 517 U.S. 748, 771 (1996); see id., at 776-777 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), and so we repeatedly have said that when Congress confers decisionmaking authority upon agencies Congress must \"lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [act] is directed to conform.\" J. W. Hampton, Jr.,  Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928). We have never suggested that an agency can cure an unlawful delegation of legislative power by adopting in its discretion a limiting construction of the statute. Both Fahey v. Mallonee, 332 U.S. 245, 252-253 (1947), and Lichter v. United States, 334 U.S. 742, 783 (1948), mention agency regulations in the course of their nondelegation discussions, but Lichter did so because a subsequent Congress had incorporated the regulations into a revised version of the statute, ibid., and Fahey because the customary practices in the area, implicitly incorporated into the statute, were reflected in the regulations. 332 U.S., at 250. The idea that an agency can cure an unconstitutionally standardless delegation of power by declining to exercise some of that power seems to us internally contradictory. The very choice of which portion of the power to exercise-that is to say, the prescription of the standard that Congress had omitted-would itself be an exercise of the forbidden legislative authority. Whether the statute delegates legislative power is a question for the courts, and an agency's voluntary self-denial has no bearing upon the answer.~    ~    ~      19~      We agree with the Solicitor General that the text of 109(b)(1) of the CAA at a minimum requires that \"[f]or a discrete set of pollutants and based on published air quality criteria that reflect the latest scientific knowledge, [the] EPA must establish uniform national standards at a level that is requisite to protect public health from the adverse effects of the pollutant in the ambient air.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 99-1257, p. 5. Requisite, in turn, \"mean[s] sufficient, but not more than necessary.\" Id., at 7. These limits on the EPA's discretion are strikingly similar to the ones we approved in Touby v. United States, 500 U.S. 160 (1991), which permitted the Attorney General to designate a drug as a controlled substance for purposes of criminal drug enforcement if doing so was \" 'necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety.' \" Id., at 163. They also resemble the Occupational Safety and Health Act provision requiring the agency to \" 'set the standard which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer any impairment of health' \"-which the Court upheld in Industrial Union Dept., AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Institute, 448 U.S. 607, 646 (1980), and which even then-Justice Rehnquist, who alone in that case thought the statute violated the nondelegation doctrine, see id., at 671 (opinion concurring in judgment), would have upheld if, like the statute here, it did not permit economic costs to be considered. See American Textile Mfrs. Institute, Inc. v. Donovan, 452 U.S. 490, 545 (1981) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).~    ~    ~      20~      The scope of discretion 109(b)(1) allows is in fact well within the outer limits of our nondelegation precedents. In the history of the Court we have found the requisite \"intelligible principle\" lacking in only two statutes, one of which provided literally no guidance for the exercise of discretion, and the other of which conferred authority to regulate the entire economy on the basis of no more precise a standard than stimulating the economy by assuring \"fair competition.\" See Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388 (1935); A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935). We have, on the other hand, upheld the validity of 11(b)(2) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 821, which gave the Securities and Exchange Commission authority to modify the structure of holding company systems so as to ensure that they are not \"unduly or unnecessarily complicate[d]\" and do not \"unfairly or inequitably distribute voting power among security holders.\" American Power  Light Co. v. SEC, 329 U.S. 90, 104 (1946). We have approved the wartime conferral of agency power to fix the prices of commodities at a level that \" 'will be generally fair and equitable and will effectuate the [in some respects conflicting] purposes of th[e] Act.' \" Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 420, 423-426 (1944). And we have found an \"intelligible principle\" in various statutes authorizing regulation in the \"public interest.\" See, e.g., National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 190, 225-226 (1943) (FCC's power to regulate airwaves); New York Central Securities Corp. v. United States, 287 U.S. 12, 24-25 (1932) (ICC's power to approve railroad consolidations). In short, we have \"almost never felt qualified to second-guess Congress regarding the permissible degree of policy judgment that can be left to those executing or applying the law.\" Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 416 (1989) (Scalia,~    ~    ~      21~      J., dissenting); see id., at 373 (majority opinion).~    ~    ~      22~      It is true enough that the degree of agency discretion that is acceptable varies according to the scope of the power congressionally conferred. See Loving v. United States, supra, at 772-773; United States v. Mazurie, 419 U.S. 544, 556-557 (1975). While Congress need not provide any direction to the EPA regarding the manner in which it is to define \"country elevators,\" which are to be exempt from new-stationary-source regulations governing grain elevators, see 7411(i), it must provide substantial guidance on setting air standards that affect the entire national economy. But even in sweeping regulatory schemes we have never demanded, as the Court of Appeals did here, that statutes provide a \"determinate criterion\" for saying \"how much [of the regulated harm] is too much.\" 175 F.3d, at 1034. In Touby, for example, we did not require the statute to decree how \"imminent\" was too imminent, or how \"necessary\" was necessary enough, or even-most relevant here-how \"hazardous\" was too hazardous. 500 U.S., at 165-167. Similarly, the statute at issue in Lichter authorized agencies to recoup \"excess profits\" paid under wartime Government contracts, yet we did not insist that Congress specify how much profit was too much. 334 U.S., at 783-786. It is therefore not conclusive for delegation purposes that, as respondents argue, ozone and particulate matter are \"nonthreshold\" pollutants that inflict a continuum of adverse health effects at any airborne concentration greater than zero, and hence require the EPA to make judgments of degree. \"[A] certain degree of discretion, and thus of lawmaking, inheres in most executive or judicial action.\" Mistretta v. United States, supra, at 417 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (emphasis deleted); see 488 U.S., at 378-379 (majority opinion). Section 109(b)(1) of the CAA, which to repeat we interpret as requiring the EPA to set air quality standards at the level that is \"requisite\"-that is, not lower or higher than is necessary-to protect the public health with an adequate margin of safety, fits comfortably within the scope of discretion permitted by our precedent.~    ~    ~      23~      We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals remanding for reinterpretation that would avoid a supposed delegation of legislative power. It will remain for the Court of Appeals-on the remand that we direct for other reasons-to dispose of any other preserved challenge to the NAAQS under the judicial-review provisions contained in 42 U.S.C.  7607(d)(9).~    ~    IV~    ~      24~      The final two issues on which we granted certiorari concern the EPA's authority to implement the revised ozone NAAQS in areas whose ozone levels currently exceed the maximum level permitted by that standard. The CAA designates such areas \"nonattainment,\" 107(d)(1), 42 U.S.C.  7407(d)(1); see also Pub. L. 105-178, 6103, 112 Stat. 465 (setting timeline for new ozone designations), and it exposes them to additional restrictions over and above the implementation requirements imposed generally by 110 of the CAA. These additional restrictions are found in the five substantive subparts of Part D of Title I, 42 U.S.C.  7501-7515. Subpart 1, 7501-7509a, contains general nonattainment regulations that pertain to every pollutant for which a NAAQS exists. Subparts 2 through 5, 7511-7514a, contain rules tailored to specific individual pollutants. Subpart 2, added by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, 103, 104 Stat. 2423, addresses ozone. 42 U.S.C.  7511-7511f. The dispute before us here, in a nutshell, is whether Subpart 1 alone (as the agency determined), or rather Subpart 2 or some combination of Subparts 1 and 2, controls the implementation of the revised ozone NAAQS in nonattainment areas.~    ~    ~      25~      * The Administrator first urges, however, that we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals on this issue because it lacked jurisdiction to review the EPA's implementation policy. Section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C.  7607(b)(1), gives the court jurisdiction over \"any ... nationally applicable regulations promulgated, or final action taken, by the Administrator,\" but the EPA argues that its implementation policy was not agency \"action,\" was not \"final\" action, and is not ripe for review. We reject each of these three contentions.~    ~    ~      26~      At the same time the EPA proposed the revised ozone NAAQS in 1996, it also proposed an \"interim implementation policy\" for the NAAQS, see 61 Fed. Reg. 65752 (1996), that was to govern until the details of implementation could be put in final form through specific \"rulemaking actions.\" The preamble to this proposed policy declared that \"the interim implementation policy ... represent[s] EPA's preliminary views on these issues and, while it may include various statements that States must take certain actions, these statements are made pursuant to EPA's preliminary interpretations, and thus do not bind the States and public as a matter of law.\" Ibid. If the EPA had done no more, we perhaps could accept its current claim that its action was not final. However, after the agency had accepted comments on its proposed policy, and on the same day that the final ozone NAAQS was promulgated, the White House published in the Federal Register what it titled a \"Memorandum for the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency\" that prescribed implementation procedures for the EPA to follow. 62 Fed. Reg. 38421 (1997). (For purposes of our analysis we shall assume that this memorandum was not itself action by the EPA.) The EPA supplemented this memorandum with an explanation of the implementation procedures, which it published in the explanatory preamble to its final ozone NAAQS under the heading, \"Final decision on the primary standard.\" Id., at 38873. \"In light of comments received regarding the interpretation proposed in the Interim Implementation Policy,\" the EPA announced, it had \"reconsidered that interpretation\" and settled on a new one. Ibid. The provisions of \"subpart 1 of part D of Title I of the Act\" will immediately \"apply to the implementation of the new 8-hour [ozone] standards.\" Ibid.; see also id., at 38885 (new standard to be implemented \"simultaneously [with the old standard] ... under the provisions of ... subpart 1\"). Moreover, the provisions of subpart 2 \"will [also] continue to apply as a matter of law for so long as an area is not attaining the [old] 1-hour standard.\" Id., at 38873. Once the area reaches attainment for the old standard, however, \"the provisions of subpart 2 will have been achieved and those provisions will no longer apply.\" Ibid.; see also id., at 38884-38885.~    ~    ~      27~      We have little trouble concluding that this constitutes final agency action subject to review under 307. The bite in the phrase \"final action\" (which bears the same meaning in 307(b)(1) that it does under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) 5 U.S.C.  704 see Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., 446 U.S. 578, 586 (1980)) is not in the word \"action,\" which is meant to cover comprehensively every manner in which an agency may exercise its power. See FTC v. Standard Oil Co. of Cal., 449 U.S. 232, 238, n. 7 (1980). It is rather in the word \"final,\" which requires that the action under review \"mark the consummation of the agency's decisionmaking process.\" Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-178 (1997). Only if the \"EPA has rendered its last word on the matter\" in question, Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., supra, at 586, is its action \"final\" and thus reviewable. That standard is satisfied here. The EPA's \"decisionmaking process,\" which began with the 1996 proposal and continued with the reception of public comments, concluded when the agency, \"in light of [these comments],\" and in conjunction with a corresponding directive from the White House, adopted the interpretation of Part D at issue here. Since that interpretation issued, the EPA has refused in subsequent rulemakings to reconsider it, explaining to disappointed commenters that its earlier decision was conclusive. See 63 Fed. Reg. 31014, 31018-31019 (1998). Though the agency has not dressed its decision with the conventional procedural accoutrements of finality, its own behavior thus belies the claim that its interpretation is not final.~    ~    ~      28~      The decision is also ripe for our review. \"Ripeness 'requir[es] us to evaluate both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.' \" Texas v. United States, 523 U.S. 296, 300-301 (1998) (quoting Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149 (1967)). The question before us here is purely one of statutory interpretation that would not \"benefit from further factual development of the issues presented.\" Ohio Forestry Assn., Inc. v. Sierra Club, 523 U.S. 726, 733 (1998). Nor will our review \"inappropriately interfere with further administrative action,\" ibid., since the EPA has concluded its consideration of the implementation issue. Finally, as for hardship to the parties: The respondent States must-on pain of forfeiting to the EPA control over implementation of the NAAQS-promptly undertake the lengthy and expensive task of developing state implementation plans (SIP's) that will attain the new, more stringent standard within five years. See 42 U.S.C.  7410 7502. Whether or not this would suffice in an ordinary case brought under the review provisions of the APA, see 5 U.S.C.  704 we have characterized the special judicial-review provision of the CAA, 42 U.S.C.  7607(b), as one of those statutes that specifically provides for \"preenforcement\" review, see Ohio Forestry Assn., Inc. v. Sierra Club, supra, at 737. Such statutes, we have said, permit \"judicial review directly, even before the concrete effects normally required for APA review are felt.\" Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U.S. 871, 891 (1990). The effects at issue here surely meet that lower standard.~    ~    ~      29~      Beyond all this, the implementation issue was fairly included within the challenges to the final ozone rule that were properly before the Court of Appeals. Respondents argued below that the EPA could not revise the ozone standard, because to do so would trigger the use of Subpart 1, which had been supplanted (for ozone) by the specific rules of Subpart 2. Brief for Industry Petitioners and Intervenors in No. 97-1441 (and consolidated cases) (CADC), pp. 32-34. The EPA responded that Subpart 2 did not supplant but simply supplemented Subpart 1, so that the latter section still \"applies to all nonattainment areas for all NAAQS, ... including nonattainment areas for any revised ozone standard.\" Final Brief for EPA in No. 97-1441 (and consolidated cases) (CADC), pp. 67-68.~    ~    ~      30~      The agency later reiterated that Subpart 2 \"does not supplant implementation provisions for revised ozone standards. This interpretation fully harmonizes Subpart 2 with EPA's clear authority to revise any NAAQS.\" Id., at 71. In other words, the EPA was arguing that the revised standard could be issued, despite its apparent incompatibility with portions of Subpart 2, because it would be implemented under Subpart 1 rather than Subpart 2. The District of Columbia Circuit ultimately agreed that Subpart 2 could be harmonized with the EPA's authority to promulgate revised NAAQS, but not because Subpart 2 is entirely inapplicable-which is one of EPA's assignments of error. It is unreasonable to contend, as the EPA now does, that the Court of Appeals was obligated to reach the agency's preferred result, but forbidden to assess the reasons the EPA had given for reaching that result. The implementation issue was fairly included within respondents' challenge to the ozone rule, which all parties agree is final agency action ripe for review.~    ~    B~    ~      31~      Our approach to the merits of the parties' dispute is the familiar one of Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984). If the statute resolves the question whether Subpart 1 or Subpart 2 (or some combination of the two) shall apply to revised ozone NAAQS, then \"that is the end of the matter.\" Id., at 842-843. But if the statute is \"silent or ambiguous\" with respect to the issue, then we must defer to a \"reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.\" Id., at 844. We cannot agree with the Court of Appeals that Subpart 2 clearly controls the implementation of revised ozone NAAQS, see 175 F.3d, at 1048-1050, because we find the statute to some extent ambiguous. We conclude, however, that the agency's interpretation goes beyond the limits of what is ambiguous and contradicts what in our view is quite clear. We therefore hold the implementation policy unlawful. See ATT Corp. v. Iowa Utilities Bd., 525 U.S. 366, 392 (1999).~    ~    ~      32~      The text of Subpart 1 at first seems to point the way to a clear answer to the question, which Subpart controls? Two sections of Subpart 1, 7502(a)(1)(C) and 7502(a)(2)(D), contain switching provisions stating that if the classification of ozone nonattainment areas is \"specifically provided [for] under other provisions of [Part D],\" then those provisions will control instead of Subpart 1's. Thus it is true but incomplete to note, as the Administrator does, that the substantive language of Subpart 1 is broad enough to apply to revised ozone standards. See, e.g., 7502(a)(1)(A) (instructing the Administrator to classify nonattainment areas according to \"any revised standard, including a revision of any standard in effect on November 15, 1990\"); 7502(a)(2)(A) (setting attainment deadlines). To determine whether that language does apply one must resolve the further textual issue whether some other provision, namely Subpart 2, provides for the classification of ozone nonattainment areas. If it does, then according to the switching provisions of Subpart 1 it will control.~    ~    ~      33~      So, does Subpart 2 provide for classifying nonattainment ozone areas under the revised standard? It unquestionably does. The backbone of the subpart is Table 1, printed in 7511(a)(1) and reproduced in the margin here,5 which defines five categories of ozone nonattainment areas and prescribes attainment deadlines for each. Section 7511(a)(1) funnels all nonattainment areas into the table for classification, declaring that \"[e]ach area designated nonattainment for ozone ... shall be classified at the time of such designation, under table 1, by operation of law.\" And once an area has been classified, \"the primary standard attainment date for ozone shall be as expeditiously as practicable but not later than the date provided in table 1.\" The EPA argues that this text is not as clear or comprehensive as it seems, because the title of 7511(a) reads \"Classification and attainment dates for 1989 nonattainment areas,\" which suggests that Subpart 2 applies only to areas that were in nonattainment in 1989, and not to areas later designated nonattainment under a revised ozone standard. The suggestion must be rejected, however, because 7511(b)(1) specifically provides for the classification of areas that were in attainment in 1989 but have subsequently slipped into nonattainment. It thus makes clear that Subpart 2 is not limited solely to 1989 nonattainment areas. This eliminates the interpretive role of the title, which may only \"she[d] light on some ambiguous word or phrase in the statute itself,\" Carter v. United States, 530 U.S. 255, 267 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U.S., at 212, in turn quoting Trainmen v. Baltimore  Ohio R. Co., 331 U.S. 519, 528-529 (1947)).~    ~    ~      34~      It may well be, as the EPA argues-and as the concurring opinion below on denial of rehearing pointed out, see 195 F.3d, at 11-12-that some provisions of Subpart 2 are ill fitted to implementation of the revised standard. Using the old 1-hour averages of ozone levels, for example, as Subpart 2 requires, see 7511(a)(1); 44 Fed. Reg. 8202 (1979), would produce at best an inexact estimate of the new 8-hour averages, see 40 CFR  50.10 and App. I (1999). Also, to the extent that the new ozone standard is stricter than the old one, see Reply Brief for Petitioners in No. 99-1257, p. 17 (\"the stricter 8-hour NAAQS\"); 62 Fed. Reg. 38856, 38858 (1997) (8-hour standard of 0.09 ppm rather than 0.08 ppm would have \"generally represent[ed] the continuation of the [old] level of protection\"), the classification system of Subpart 2 contains a gap, because it fails to classify areas whose ozone levels are greater than the new standard (and thus nonattaining) but less than the approximation of the old standard codified by Table 1. And finally, Subpart 2's method for calculating attainment dates-which is simply to count forward a certain number of years from November 15, 1990 (the date the 1990 CAA Amendments took force), depending on how far out of attainment the area started-seems to make no sense for areas that are first classified under a new standard after November 15, 1990. If, for example, areas were classified in the year 2000, many of the deadlines would already have expired at the time of classification.~    ~    ~      35~      These gaps in Subpart 2's scheme prevent us from concluding that Congress clearly intended Subpart 2 to be the exclusive, permanent means of enforcing a revised ozone standard in nonattainment areas. The statute is in our view ambiguous concerning the manner in which Subpart 1 and Subpart 2 interact with regard to revised ozone standards, and we would defer to the EPA's reasonable resolution of that ambiguity. See FDA v. Brown  Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S., at 132; INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 424 (1999). We cannot defer, however, to the interpretation the EPA has given.~    ~    ~      36~      Whatever effect may be accorded the gaps in Subpart 2 as implying some limited applicability of Subpart 1, they cannot be thought to render Subpart 2's carefully designed restrictions on EPA discretion utterly nugatory once a new standard has been promulgated, as the EPA has concluded. The principal distinction between Subpart 1 and Subpart 2 is that the latter eliminates regulatory discretion that the former allowed. While Subpart 1 permits the EPA to establish classifications for nonattainment areas, Subpart 2 classifies areas as a matter of law based on a table. Compare 7502(a)(1) with 7511(a)(1) (Table 1). Whereas the EPA has discretion under Subpart 1 to extend attainment dates for as long as 12 years, under Subpart 2 it may grant no more than 2 years' extension. Compare 7502(a)(2)(A) and (C) with 7511(a)(5). Whereas Subpart 1 gives the EPA considerable discretion to shape nonattainment programs, Subpart 2 prescribes large parts of them by law. Compare 7502(c) and (d) with 7511a. Yet according to the EPA, Subpart 2 was simply Congress's \"approach to the implementation of the [old] 1-hour\" standard, and so there was no reason that \"the new standard could not simultaneously be implemented under ... subpart 1.\" 62 Fed. Reg. 38856, 38885 (1997); see also id., at 38873 (\"the provisions of subpart 1 ... would apply to the implementation of the new 8-hour ozone standards\"). To use a few apparent gaps in Subpart 2 to render its textually explicit applicability to nonattainment areas under the new standard utterly inoperative is to go over the edge of reasonable interpretation. The EPA may not construe the statute in a way that completely nullifies textually applicable provisions meant to limit its discretion.~    ~    ~      37~      The EPA's interpretation making Subpart 2 abruptly obsolete is all the more astonishing because Subpart 2 was obviously written to govern implementation for some time. Some of the elements required to be included in SIP's under Subpart 2 were not to take effect until many years after the passage of the Act. See 7511a(e)(3) (restrictions on \"electric utility and industrial and commercial boiler[s]\" to be \"effective 8 years after November 15, 1990\"); 7511a(c)(5)(A) (vehicle monitoring program to \"[b]egi[n] 6 years after November 15, 1990\"); 7511a(g)(1) (emissions milestone requirements to be applied \"6 years after November 15, 1990, and at intervals of every 3 years thereafter\"). A plan reaching so far into the future was not enacted to be abandoned the next time the EPA reviewed the ozone standard-which Congress knew could happen at any time, since the technical staff papers had already been completed in late 1989. See 58 Fed. Reg. 13008, 13010 (1993); see also 42 U.S.C.  7409(d)(1) (NAAQS must be reviewed and, if appropriate, revised at least once every five years).~    ~    ~      38~      Yet nothing in the EPA's interpretation would have prevented the agency from aborting Subpart 2 the day after it was enacted. Even now, if the EPA's interpretation were correct, some areas of the country could be required to meet the new, more stringent ozone standard in at most the same time that Subpart 2 had allowed them to meet the old standard. Compare 7502(a)(2) (Subpart 1 attainment dates) with 7511(a) (Subpart 2 attainment dates). Los Angeles, for instance, \"would be required to attain the revised NAAQS under Subpart 1 no later than the same year that marks the outer time limit for attaining Subpart 2's one-hour ozone standard.\" Brief for Petitioners in No. 99-1257, p. 49. An interpretation of Subpart 2 so at odds with its structure and manifest purpose cannot be sustained.~    ~    ~      39~      We therefore find the EPA's implementation policy to be unlawful, though not in the precise respect determined by the Court of Appeals. After our remand, and the Court of Appeals' final disposition of this case, it is left to the EPA to develop a reasonable interpretation of the nonattainment implementation provisions insofar as they apply to revised ozone NAAQS.~    ~    ~      40~      * * *~    ~    ~      41~      To summarize our holdings in these unusually complex cases: (1) The EPA may not consider implementation costs in setting primary and secondary NAAQS under 109(b) of the CAA. (2) Section 109(b)(1) does not delegate legislative power to the EPA in contravention of Art. I, 1, of the Constitution. (3) The Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to review the EPA's interpretation of Part D of Title I of the CAA, relating to the implementation of the revised ozone NAAQS. (4) The EPA's interpretation of that Part is unreasonable.~    ~    ~      42~      The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cases are remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      43~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         None of the sections of the CAA in which the District of Columbia Circuit has found authority for the EPA to consider costs shares 109(b)(1)'s prominence in the overall statutory scheme. See, e.g., Michigan v. EPA, 213 F.3d 663, 678-679 (CADC 2000); George E. Warren Corp. v. EPA, 159 F.3d 616, 623-624 (CADC 1998); Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. EPA, 824 F.2d 1146, 1154-1168 (CADC 1987) (en banc).~      ~      ~        2~         Respondents contend that this advice is required to be included in the NAAQS rulemaking record-which, if true, would suggest that it was relevant to the standard-setting process. But the provision respondents cite for their contention, 42 U.S.C.  7607(d)(3), requires only that \"pertinent findings, recommendations, and comments by the Scientific Review Committee\" be included. The Committee's advice concerning certain aspects of \"adverse public health ... effects\" from various attainment strategies is unquestionably pertinent; but to say that Committee-generated cost data are pertinent is to beg the question. Likewise, while \"all written comments\" must be placed in the docket, 7607(d)(4)(B)(i), the EPA need respond only to the \"significant\" ones, 7407(d)(6)(B); comments regarding cost data are not significant if cost data are irrelevant.~      ~      ~        3~         Respondents scarcely mention in their arguments the secondary NAAQS required by 109(b)(2), 42 U.S.C.  7409(b)(2). For many of the same reasons described in the body of the opinion, as well as the text of 109(b)(2), which instructs the EPA to set the standards at a level \"requisite to protect the public welfare from any known or anticipated adverse effects associated with the presence of such air pollutant in the ambient air\" (emphasis added), we conclude that the EPA may not consider implementation costs in setting the secondary NAAQS.~      ~      ~        4~         Respondents' speculation that the EPA is secretly considering the costs of attainment without telling anyone is irrelevant to our interpretive inquiry. If such an allegation could be proved, it would be grounds for vacating the NAAQS, because the Administrator had not followed the law. See, e.g., Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-843 (1984); Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co. v. Commissioner, 523 U.S. 382, 387 (1998). It would not, however, be grounds for this Court's changing the law.~      ~      ~        5~          TABLE I~      ~    ~    ~      44~                                                   Primary standardArea class         Design value*            attainment date**Marginal        0.121 up to 0.138      3 years after November 15, 1990Moderate        0.138 up to 0.160      6 years after November 15, 1990Serious         0.160 up to 0.180      9 years after November 15, 1990Severe          0.180 up to 0.280     15 years after November 15, 1990Extreme         0.280 and above       20 years after November 15, 1990*The design value is measured in parts per million (ppm).**The primary standard attainment date is measured from November 15, 1990.~    ~    ~      45~      Justice Thomas, concurring.~    ~    ~      46~      I agree with the majority that 109's directive to the agency is no less an \"intelligible principle\" than a host of other directives that we have approved. Ante, at 13-15. I also agree that the Court of Appeals' remand to the agency to make its own corrective interpretation does not accord with our understanding of the delegation issue. Ante, at 12. I write separately, however, to express my concern that there may nevertheless be a genuine constitutional problem with 109, a problem which the parties did not address.~    ~    ~      47~      The parties to this case who briefed the constitutional issue wrangled over constitutional doctrine with barely a nod to the text of the Constitution. Although this Court since 1928 has treated the \"intelligible principle\" requirement as the only constitutional limit on congressional grants of power to administrative agencies, see J. W. Hampton, Jr.,  Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928), the Constitution does not speak of \"intelligible principles.\" Rather, it speaks in much simpler terms: \"All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress.\" U.S. Const., Art. 1, 1 (emphasis added). I am not convinced that the intelligible principle doctrine serves to prevent all cessions of legislative power. I believe that there are cases in which the principle is intelligible and yet the significance of the delegated decision is simply too great for the decision to be called anything other than \"legislative.\"~    ~    ~      48~      As it is, none of the parties to this case has examined the text of the Constitution or asked us to reconsider our precedents on cessions of legislative power. On a future day, however, I would be willing to address the question whether our delegation jurisprudence has strayed too far from our Founders' understanding of separation of powers.~    ~    ~      49~      Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.~    ~    ~      50~      Section 109(b)(1) delegates to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the authority to promulgate national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). In Part III of its opinion, ante, at 11-15, the Court convincingly explains why the Court of Appeals erred when it concluded that 109 effected \"an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.\" American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. EPA, 175 F.3d 1027, 1033 (CADC 1999) (per curiam). I wholeheartedly endorse the Court's result and endorse its explanation of its reasons, albeit with the following caveat.~    ~    ~      51~      The Court has two choices. We could choose to articulate our ultimate disposition of this issue by frankly acknowledging that the power delegated to the EPA is \"legislative\" but nevertheless conclude that the delegation is constitutional because adequately limited by the terms of the authorizing statute. Alternatively, we could pretend, as the Court does, that the authority delegated to the EPA is somehow not \"legislative power.\" Despite the fact that there is language in our opinions that supports the Court's articulation of our holding,1 I am persuaded that it would be both wiser and more faithful to what we have actually done in delegation cases to admit that agency rulemaking authority is \"legislative power.\"2~    ~    ~      52~      The proper characterization of governmental power should generally depend on the nature of the power, not on the identity of the person exercising it. See Black's Law Dictionary 899 (6th ed. 1990) (defining \"legislation\" as, inter alia, \"[f]ormulation of rule[s] for the future\"); 1 K. Davis  R. Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise 2.3, p. 37 (3d ed. 1994) (\"If legislative power means the power to make rules of conduct that bind everyone based on resolution of major policy issues, scores of agencies exercise legislative power routinely by promulgating what are candidly called 'legislative rules' \"). If the NAAQS that the EPA promulgated had been prescribed by Congress, everyone would agree that those rules would be the product of an exercise of \"legislative power.\" The same characterization is appropriate when an agency exercises rulemaking authority pursuant to a permissible delegation from Congress.~    ~    ~      53~      My view is not only more faithful to normal English usage, but is also fully consistent with the text of the Constitution. In Article I, the Framers vested \"All legislative Powers\" in the Congress, Art. I., 1, just as in Article II they vested the \"executive Power\" in the President, Art. II, 1. Those provisions do not purport to limit the authority of either recipient of power to delegate authority to others. See Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 752 (1986) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment) (\"Despite the statement in Article I of the Constitution that 'All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States,' it is far from novel to acknowledge that independent agencies do indeed exercise legislative powers\"); INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 985-986 (1983) (White, J., dissenting) (\"[L]egislative power can be exercised by independent agencies and Executive departments ...\"); 1 Davis 2.6, p. 66 (\"The Court was probably mistaken from the outset in interpreting Article I's grant of power to Congress as an implicit limit on Congress' authority to delegate legislative power\"). Surely the authority granted to members of the Cabinet and federal law enforcement agents is properly characterized as \"Executive\" even though not exercised by the President. Cf. Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 705-706 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (arguing that the independent counsel exercised \"executive power\" unconstrained by the President).~    ~    ~      54~      It seems clear that an executive agency's exercise of rulemaking authority pursuant to a valid delegation from Congress is \"legislative.\" As long as the delegation provides a sufficiently intelligible principle, there is nothing inherently unconstitutional about it. Accordingly, while I join Parts I, II, and IV of the Court's opinion, and agree with almost everything said in Part III, I would hold that when Congress enacted 109, it effected a constitutional delegation of legislative power to the EPA.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         See, e.g., Touby v. United States, 500 U.S. 160, 165 (1991); United States v. Shreveport Grain  Elevator Co., 287 U.S. 77, 85 (1932); J. W. Hampton, Jr.,  Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 407 (1928); Field v. Clark, 143 U.S. 649, 692 (1892).~      ~      ~        2~         See Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 372 (1989) (\"[O]ur jurisprudence has been driven by a practical understanding that in our increasingly complex society ... Congress simply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate power ...\"). See also Loving v. United States, 517 U.S. 748, 758 (1996) (\"[The nondelegation] principle does not mean ... that only Congress can make a rule of prospective force\"); 1 K. Davis  R. Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise 2.6, p. 66 (3d ed. 1994) (\"Except for two 1935 cases, the Court has never enforced its frequently announced prohibition on congressional delegation of legislative power\").~      ~    ~    ~      55~      Justice Breyer, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.~    ~    ~      56~      I join Parts I, III, and IV of the Court's opinion. I also agree with the Court's determination in Part II that the Clean Air Act does not permit the Environmental Protection Agency to consider the economic costs of implementation when setting national ambient air quality standards under 109(b)(1) of the Act. But I would not rest this conclusion solely upon 109's language or upon a presumption, such as the Court's presumption that any authority the Act grants the EPA to consider costs must flow from a \"textual commitment\" that is \"clear.\" Ante, at 7. In order better to achieve regulatory goals-for example, to allocate resources so that they save more lives or produce a cleaner environment-regulators must often take account of all of a proposed regulation's adverse effects, at least where those adverse effects clearly threaten serious and disproportionate public harm. Hence, I believe that, other things being equal, we should read silences or ambiguities in the language of regulatory statutes as permitting, not forbidding, this type of rational regulation.~    ~    ~      57~      In this case, however, other things are not equal. Here, legislative history, along with the statute's structure, indicates that 109's language reflects a congressional decision not to delegate to the agency the legal authority to consider economic costs of compliance.~    ~    ~      58~      For one thing, the legislative history shows that Congress intended the statute to be \"technology forcing.\" Senator Edmund Muskie, the primary sponsor of the 1970 amendments to the Act, introduced them by saying that Congress' primary responsibility in drafting the Act was not \"to be limited by what is or appears to be technologically or economically feasible,\" but \"to establish what the public interest requires to protect the health of persons,\" even if that means that \"industries will be asked to do what seems to be impossible at the present time.\" 116 Cong. Rec. 32901-32902 (1970), 1 Legislative History of the Clean Air Amendments of 1970 (Committee Report compiled for the Senate Committee on Public Works by the Library of Congress), Ser. No. 93-18, p. 227 (1974) (hereinafter Leg. Hist.) (emphasis added).~    ~    ~      59~      The Senate directly focused upon the technical feasibility and cost of implementing the Act's mandates. And it made clear that it intended the Administrator to develop air quality standards set independently of either. The Senate Report for the 1970 amendments explains:~    ~    ~      60~      \"In the Committee discussions, considerable concern was expressed regarding the use of the concept of technical feasibility as the basis of ambient air standards. The Committee determined that 1) the health of people is more important than the question of whether the early achievement of ambient air quality standards protective of health is technically feasible; and, 2) the growth of pollution load in many areas, even with application of available technology, would still be deleterious to public health. . . .~    ~    ~      61~      \"Therefore, the Committee determined that existing sources of pollutants either should meet the standard of the law or be closed down . . . .\" S. Rep. No. 91-1196, pp. 2-3 (1970), 1 Leg. Hist. 402-403 (emphasis added).~    ~    ~      62~      Indeed, this Court, after reviewing the entire legislative history, concluded that the 1970 amendments were \"expressly designed to force regulated sources to develop pollution control devices that might at the time appear to be economically or technologically infeasible.\" Union Elec. Co. v. EPA, 427 U.S. 246, 257 (1976) (emphasis added). And the Court added that the 1970 amendments were intended to be a \"drastic remedy to . . . a serious and otherwise uncheckable problem.\" Id., at 256. Subsequent legislative history confirms that the technology-forcing goals of the 1970 amendments are still paramount in today's Act. See Clean Air Conference Report (1977): Statement of Intent; Clarification of Select Provisions, 123 Cong. Rec. 27070 (1977) (stating, regarding the 1977 amendments to the Act, that \"this year's legislation retains and even strengthens the technology forcing . . . goals of the 1970 Act\"); S. Rep. No. 101-228, p. 5 (1989) (stating that the 1990 amendments to the Act require ambient air quality standards to be set at \"the level that 'protects the public health' with an 'adequate margin of safety,' without regard to the economic or technical feasibility of attainment\" (emphasis added)).~    ~    ~      63~      To read this legislative history as meaning what it says does not impute to Congress an irrational intent. Technology-forcing hopes can prove realistic. Those persons, for example, who opposed the 1970 Act's insistence on a 90% reduction in auto emission pollutants, on the ground of excessive cost, saw the development of catalytic converter technology that helped achieve substantial reductions without the economic catastrophe that some had feared. See 6(a) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, amending 202(b)(1)(A), (B), 84 Stat. 1690 (codified at 42 U.S.C.  7521(b)(1)(A), (B)) (requiring a 90% reduction in emissions); 1 Leg. Hist. 238, 240 (statement of Sen. Griffin) (arguing that the emissions standards could \"force [the automobile] industry out of existence\" because costs \"would not be taken into account\"); see generally Reitze, Mobile Source Air Pollution Control, 6 Envtl. Law. 309, 326-327 (2000) (discussing the development of the catalytic converter).~    ~    ~      64~      At the same time, the statute's technology-forcing objective makes regulatory efforts to determine the costs of implementation both less important and more difficult. It means that the relevant economic costs are speculative, for they include the cost of unknown future technologies. It also means that efforts to take costs into account can breed time-consuming and potentially unresolvable arguments about the accuracy and significance of cost estimates. Congress could have thought such efforts not worth the delays and uncertainties that would accompany them. In any event, that is what the statute's history seems to say. See Union Elec., supra, at 256-259. And the matter is one for Congress to decide.~    ~    ~      65~      Moreover, the Act does not, on this reading, wholly ignore cost and feasibility. As the majority points out, ante, at 6-7, the Act allows regulators to take those concerns into account when they determine how to implement ambient air quality standards. Thus, States may consider economic costs when they select the particular control devices used to meet the standards, and industries experiencing difficulty in reducing their emissions can seek an exemption or variance from the state implementation plan. See Union Elec., supra, at 266 (\"[T]he most important forum for consideration of claims of economic and technological infeasibility is before the state agency formulating the implementation plan\").~    ~    ~      66~      The Act also permits the EPA, within certain limits, to consider costs when it sets deadlines by which areas must attain the ambient air quality standards. 42 U.S.C.  7502(a)(2)(A) (providing that \"the Administrator may extend the attainment date . . . for a period no greater than 10 years from the date of designation as nonattainment, considering the severity of nonattainment and the availability and feasibility of pollution control measures\"); 7502(a)(2)(C) (permitting the Administrator to grant up to two additional 1-year extensions); cf. 7511(a)(1), (5) (setting more rigid attainment deadlines for areas in nonattainment of the ozone standard, but permitting the Administrator to grant up to two 1-year extensions). And Congress can change those statutory limits if necessary. Given the ambient air quality standards' substantial effects on States, cities, industries, and their suppliers and customers, Congress will hear from those whom compliance deadlines affect adversely, and Congress can consider whether legislative change is warranted. See, e.g., Steel Industry Compliance Extension Act of 1981, 95 Stat. 139 (codified at 42 U.S.C.  7413(e) (1988 ed.)) (repealed 1990) (granting the Administrator discretion to extend the ambient air quality standard attainment date set in the 1977 Act by up to three years for steelmaking facilities).~    ~    ~      67~      Finally, contrary to the suggestion of the Court of Appeals and of some parties, this interpretation of 109 does not require the EPA to eliminate every health risk, however slight, at any economic cost, however great, to the point of \"hurtling\" industry over \"the brink of ruin,\" or even forcing \"deindustrialization.\" American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. EPA, 175 F.3d 1027, 1037, 1038, n. 4 (CADC 1999); see also Brief for Cross-Petitioners in No. 99-1426, p. 25. The statute, by its express terms, does not compel the elimination of all risk; and it grants the Administrator sufficient flexibility to avoid setting ambient air quality standards ruinous to industry.~    ~    ~      68~      Section 109(b)(1) directs the Administrator to set standards that are \"requisite to protect the public health\" with \"an adequate margin of safety.\" But these words do not describe a world that is free of all risk-an impossible and undesirable objective. See Industrial Union Dept., AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Institute, 448 U.S. 607, 642 (1980) (plurality opinion) (the word \"safe\" does not mean \"risk-free\"). Nor are the words \"requisite\" and \"public health\" to be understood independent of context. We consider football equipment \"safe\" even if its use entails a level of risk that would make drinking water \"unsafe\" for consumption. And what counts as \"requisite\" to protecting the public health will similarly vary with background circumstances, such as the public's ordinary tolerance of the particular health risk in the particular context at issue. The Administrator can consider such background circumstances when \"decid[ing] what risks are acceptable in the world in which we live.\" Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. EPA, 824 F.2d 1146, 1165 (CADC 1987).~    ~    ~      69~      The statute also permits the Administrator to take account of comparative health risks. That is to say, she may consider whether a proposed rule promotes safety overall. A rule likely to cause more harm to health than it prevents is not a rule that is \"requisite to protect the public health.\" For example, as the Court of Appeals held and the parties do not contest, the Administrator has the authority to determine to what extent possible health risks stemming from reductions in tropospheric ozone (which, it is claimed, helps prevent cataracts and skin cancer) should be taken into account in setting the ambient air quality standard for ozone. See 175 F.3d, at 1050-1053 (remanding for the Administrator to make that determination).~    ~    ~      70~      The statute ultimately specifies that the standard set must be \"requisite to protect the public health\" \"in the judgment of the Administrator,\" 109(b)(1), 84 Stat. 1680 (emphasis added), a phrase that grants the Administrator considerable discretionary standard-setting authority.~    ~    ~      71~      The statute's words, then, authorize the Administrator to consider the severity of a pollutant's potential adverse health effects, the number of those likely to be affected, the distribution of the adverse effects, and the uncertainties surrounding each estimate. Cf. Sunstein, Is the Clean Air Act Unconstitutional?, 98 Mich. L. Rev. 303, 364 (1999). They permit the Administrator to take account of comparative health consequences. They allow her to take account of context when determining the acceptability of small risks to health. And they give her considerable discretion when she does so.~    ~    ~      72~      This discretion would seem sufficient to avoid the extreme results that some of the industry parties fear. After all, the EPA, in setting standards that \"protect the public health\" with \"an adequate margin of safety,\" retains discretionary authority to avoid regulating risks that it reasonably concludes are trivial in context. Nor need regulation lead to deindustrialization. Preindustrial society was not a very healthy society; hence a standard demanding the return of the Stone Age would not prove \"requisite to protect the public health.\"~    ~    ~      73~      Although I rely more heavily than does the Court upon legislative history and alternative sources of statutory flexibility, I reach the same ultimate conclusion. Section 109 does not delegate to the EPA authority to base the national ambient air quality standards, in whole or in part, upon the economic costs of compliance.~    ~    ",

Readers are requested to notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D. C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.TRAFFIX DEVICES, INC., PETITIONERv.MARKETING DISPLAYS, INC.~    No. 99-1571.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued November 29, 2000~    Decided March 20, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      Respondent, Marketing Displays, Inc. (MDI), holds now-expired utility patents for a \"dual-spring design\" mechanism that keeps temporary road and other outdoor signs upright in adverse wind conditions. MDI claims that its sign stands were recognizable to buyers and users because the patented design was visible near the sign stand's base. After the patents expired and petitioner TrafFix Devices, Inc., began marketing sign stands with a dual-spring mechanism copied from MDI's design, MDI brought suit under the Trademark Act of 1964 for, inter alia, trade dress infringement. The District Court granted TrafFix's motion for summary judgment, holding that no reasonable trier of fact could determine that MDI had established secondary meaning in its alleged trade dress, i.e., consumers did not associate the dual-spring design's look with MDI; and, as an independent reason, that there could be no trade dress protection for the design because it was functional. The Sixth Circuit reversed. Among other things, it suggested that the District Court committed legal error by looking only to the dual-spring design when evaluating MDI's trade dress because a competitor had to find some way to hide the design or otherwise set it apart from MDI's; explained, relying on Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co., 514 U.S. 159, 165, that exclusive use of a feature must put competitors at a significant non-reputation-related disadvantage before trade dress protection is denied on functionality grounds; and noted a split among the Circuits on the issue whether an expired utility patent forecloses the possibility of trade dress protection in the product's design.~      Held: Because MDI's dual-spring design is a functional feature for which there is no trade dress protection, MDI's claim is barred. Pp. 4-11.~      (a) Trade dress can be protected under federal law, but the person asserting such protection in an infringement action must prove that the matter sought to be protected is not functional, 15 U.S.C.  1125(a)(3). Trade dress protection must subsist with the recognition that in many instances there is no prohibition against copying goods and products. An expired utility patent has vital significance in resolving a trade dress claim, for a utility patent is strong evidence that the features therein claimed are functional. The central advance claimed in the expired utility patents here is the dual-spring design, which is an essential feature of the trade dress MDI now seeks to protect. However, MDI did not, and cannot, carry the burden of overcoming the strong evidentiary inference of functionality based on the disclosure of the dual-spring design in the claims of the expired patents. The springs are necessary to the device's operation, and they would have been covered by the claims of the expired patents even though they look different from the embodiment revealed in those patents, see Sarkisian v. Winn-Proof Corp., 697 F.2d 1313. The rationale for the rule that the disclosure of a feature in a utility patent's claims constitutes strong evidence of functionality is well illustrated in this case. The design serves the important purpose of keeping the sign upright in heavy wind conditions, and statements in the expired patent applications indicate that it does so in a unique and useful manner and at a cost advantage over alternative designs. Pp. 4-8.~      (b) In reversing the summary judgment against MDI, the Sixth Circuit gave insufficient weight to the importance of the expired utility patents, and their evidentiary significance, in establishing the device's functionality. The error was likely caused by its misinterpretation of trade dress principles in other respects. \" 'In general terms a product feature is functional,' and cannot serve as a trademark, 'if it is essential to the use or purpose of the article or if it affects the cost or quality of the article.' \" Qualitex, supra, at 165 (quoting Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 850, n. 10). This Court has expanded on that meaning, observing that a functional feature is one \"the exclusive use of [which] would put competitors at a significant non-reputation-related disadvantage,\" Qualitex, supra, at 165, but that language does not mean that competitive necessity is a necessary test for functionality. Where the design is functional under the Inwood formulation there is no need to proceed further to consider competitive necessity. This Court has allowed trade dress protection to inherently distinctive product features on the assumption that they were not functional. Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S. 763, 774. Here, however, beyond serving the purpose of informing consumers that the sign stands are made by MDI, the design provides a unique and useful mechanism to resist the wind's force. Functionality having been established, whether the design has acquired secondary meaning need not be considered. Nor is it necessary to speculate about other design possibilities. Finally, this Court need not resolve here the question whether the Patent Clause of the Constitution, of its own force, prohibits the holder of an expired utility patent from claiming trade dress protection. Pp. 8-11. 200 F.3d 929, reversed and remanded.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT~      Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      Temporary road signs with warnings like \"Road Work Ahead\" or \"Left Shoulder Closed\" must withstand strong gusts of wind. An inventor named Robert Sarkisian obtained two utility patents for a mechanism built upon two springs (the dual-spring design) to keep these and other outdoor signs upright despite adverse wind conditions. The holder of the now-expired Sarkisian patents, respondent Marketing Displays, Inc. (MDI), established a successful business in the manufacture and sale of sign stands incorporating the patented feature. MDI's stands for road signs were recognizable to buyers and users (it says) because the dual-spring design was visible near the base of the sign.~    ~    ~      2~      This litigation followed after the patents expired and a competitor, TrafFix Devices, Inc., sold sign stands with a visible spring mechanism that looked like MDI's. MDI and TrafFix products looked alike because they were. When TrafFix started in business, it sent an MDI product abroad to have it reverse engineered, that is to say copied. Complicating matters, TrafFix marketed its sign stands under a name similar to MDI's. MDI used the name \"WindMaster,\" while TrafFix, its new competitor, used \"WindBuster.\"~    ~    ~      3~      MDI brought suit under the Trademark Act of 1964 (Lanham Act), 60 Stat. 427, as amended, 15 U.S.C.  1051 et seq., against TrafFix for trademark infringement (based on the similar names), trade dress infringement (based on the copied dual-spring design) and unfair competition. TrafFix counterclaimed on antitrust theories. After the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan considered cross-motions for summary judgment, MDI prevailed on its trademark claim for the confusing similarity of names and was held not liable on the antitrust counterclaim; and those two rulings, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, are not before us.~    ~    ~      4~      * We are concerned with the trade dress question. The District Court ruled against MDI on its trade dress claim. 971 F. Supp. 262 (ED Mich. 1997). After determining that the one element of MDI's trade dress at issue was the dual-spring design, id., at 265, it held that \"no reasonable trier of fact could determine that MDI has established secondary meaning\" in its alleged trade dress, id., at 269. In other words, consumers did not associate the look of the dual-spring design with MDI. As a second, independent reason to grant summary judgment in favor of TrafFix, the District Court determined the dual-spring design was functional. On this rationale secondary meaning is irrelevant because there can be no trade dress protection in any event. In ruling on the functional aspect of the design, the District Court noted that Sixth Circuit precedent indicated that the burden was on MDI to prove that its trade dress was nonfunctional, and not on TrafFix to show that it was functional (a rule since adopted by Congress, see 15 U.S.C.  1125(a)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. V)), and then went on to consider MDI's arguments that the dual-spring design was subject to trade dress protection. Finding none of MDI's contentions persuasive, the District Court concluded MDI had not \"proffered sufficient evidence which would enable a reasonable trier of fact to find that MDI's vertical dual-spring design is non-functional.\" Id., at 276. Summary judgment was entered against MDI on its trade dress claims.~    ~    ~      5~      The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the trade dress ruling. 200 F.3d 929 (1999). The Court of Appeals held the District Court had erred in ruling MDI failed to show a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether it had secondary meaning in its alleged trade dress, id., at 938, and had erred further in determining that MDI could not prevail in any event because the alleged trade dress was in fact a functional product configuration, id., at 940. The Court of Appeals suggested the District Court committed legal error by looking only to the dual-spring design when evaluating MDI's trade dress. Basic to its reasoning was the Court of Appeals' observation that it took \"little imagination to conceive of a hidden dual-spring mechanism or a tri or quad-spring mechanism that might avoid infringing [MDI's] trade dress.\" Ibid. The Court of Appeals explained that \"[i]f TrafFix or another competitor chooses to use [MDI's] dual-spring design, then it will have to find some other way to set its sign apart to avoid infringing [MDI's] trade dress.\" Ibid. It was not sufficient, according to the Court of Appeals, that allowing exclusive use of a particular feature such as the dual-spring design in the guise of trade dress would \"hinde[r] competition somewhat.\" Rather, \"[e]xclusive use of a feature must 'put competitors at a significant non-reputation-related disadvantage' before trade dress protection is denied on functionality grounds.\" Ibid. (quoting Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co., 514 U.S. 159, 165 (1995)). In its criticism of the District Court's ruling on the trade dress question, the Court of Appeals took note of a split among Courts of Appeals in various other Circuits on the issue whether the existence of an expired utility patent forecloses the possibility of the patentee's claiming trade dress protection in the product's design. 200 F.3d, at 939. Compare Sunbeam Products, Inc. v. West Bend Co., 123 F.3d 246 (CA5 1997) (holding that trade dress protection is not foreclosed), Thomas  Betts Corp. v. Panduit Corp., 138 F.3d 277 (CA7 1998) (same), and Midwest Industries, Inc. v. Karavan Trailers, Inc., 175 F.3d 1356 (CA Fed 1999) (same), with Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc. v. Duracraft Corp., 58 F.3d 1498, 1500 (CA10 1995) (\"Where a product configuration is a significant inventive component of an invention covered by a utility patent . . . it cannot receive trade dress protection\"). To resolve the conflict, we granted certiorari. 530 U.S. 1260 (2000).~    ~    II~    ~      6~      It is well established that trade dress can be protected under federal law. The design or packaging of a product may acquire a distinctiveness which serves to identify the product with its manufacturer or source; and a design or package which acquires this secondary meaning, assuming other requisites are met, is a trade dress which may not be used in a manner likely to cause confusion as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of the goods. In these respects protection for trade dress exists to promote competition. As we explained just last Term, see Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Brothers, Inc., 529 U.S. 205 (2000), various Courts of Appeals have allowed claims of trade dress infringement relying on the general provision of the Lanham Act which provides a cause of action to one who is injured when a person uses \"any word, term name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof . . . which is~    ~    ~      7~      likely to cause confusion . . . as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods.\" 15 U.S.C.  1125(a)(1)(A). Congress confirmed this statutory protection for trade dress by amending the Lanham Act to recognize the concept. Title 15 U.S.C.  1125(a)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. V) provides: \"In a civil action for trade dress infringement under this chapter for trade dress not registered on the principal register, the person who asserts trade dress protection has the burden of proving that the matter sought to be protected is not functional.\" This burden of proof gives force to the well-established rule that trade dress protection may not be claimed for product features that are functional. Qualitex, supra, at 164-165; Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S. 763, 775 (1992). And in Wal-Mart, supra, we were careful to caution against misuse or over-extension of trade dress. We noted that \"product design almost invariably serves purposes other than source identification.\"~    ~    ~      8~      Id., at 213.~    ~    ~      9~      Trade dress protection must subsist with the recognition that in many instances there is no prohibition against copying goods and products. In general, unless an intellectual property right such as a patent or copyright protects an item, it will be subject to copying. As the Court has explained, copying is not always discouraged or disfavored by the laws which preserve our competitive economy. Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U.S. 141, 160 (1989). Allowing competitors to copy will have salutary effects in many instances. \"Reverse engineering of chemical and mechanical articles in the public domain often leads to significant advances in technology.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      10~      The principal question in this case is the effect of an expired patent on a claim of trade dress infringement. A prior patent, we conclude, has vital significance in resolving the trade dress claim. A utility patent is strong evidence that the features therein claimed are functional. If trade dress protection is sought for those features the strong evidence of functionality based on the previous patent adds great weight to the statutory presumption that features are deemed functional until proved otherwise by the party seeking trade dress protection. Where the expired patent claimed the features in question, one who seeks to establish trade dress protection must carry the heavy burden of showing that the feature is not functional, for instance by showing that it is merely an ornamental, incidental, or arbitrary aspect of the device.~    ~    ~      11~      In the case before us, the central advance claimed in the expired utility patents (the Sarkisian patents) is the dual-spring design; and the dual-spring design is the essential feature of the trade dress MDI now seeks to establish and to protect. The rule we have explained bars the trade dress claim, for MDI did not, and cannot, carry the burden of overcoming the strong evidentiary inference of functionality based on the disclosure of the dual-spring design in the claims of the expired patents.~    ~    ~      12~      The dual springs shown in the Sarkisian patents were well apart (at either end of a frame for holding a rectangular sign when one full side is the base) while the dual springs at issue here are close together (in a frame designed to hold a sign by one of its corners). As the District Court recognized, this makes little difference. The point is that the springs are necessary to the operation of the device. The fact that the springs in this very different-looking device fall within the claims of the patents is illustrated by MDI's own position in earlier litigation. In the late 1970's, MDI engaged in a long-running intellectual property battle with a company known as Winn-Proof. Although the precise claims of the Sarkisian patents cover sign stands with springs \"spaced apart,\" U.S. Patent No. 3,646,696, col. 4; U.S. Patent No. 3,662,482, col. 4, the Winn-Proof sign stands (with springs much like the sign stands at issue here) were found to infringe the patents by the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the judgment. Sarkisian v. Winn-Proof Corp., 697 F.2d 1313 (1983). Although the Winn-Proof traffic sign stand (with dual springs close together) did not appear, then, to infringe the literal terms of the patent claims (which called for \"spaced apart\" springs), the Winn-Proof sign stand was found to infringe the patents under the doctrine of equivalents, which allows a finding of patent infringement even when the accused product does not fall within the literal terms of the claims. Id., at 1321-1322; see generally Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chemical Co., 520 U.S. 17 (1997). In light of this past ruling-a ruling procured at MDI's own insistence-it must be concluded the products here at issue would have been covered by the claims of the expired patents.~    ~    ~      13~      The rationale for the rule that the disclosure of a feature in the claims of a utility patent constitutes strong evidence of functionality is well illustrated in this case. The dual-spring design serves the important purpose of keeping the sign upright even in heavy wind conditions; and, as confirmed by the statements in the expired patents, it does so in a unique and useful manner. As the specification of one of the patents recites, prior art \"devices, in practice, will topple under the force of a strong wind.\" U.S. Patent No. 3,662,482, col. 1. The dual-spring design allows sign stands to resist toppling in strong winds. Using a dual-spring design rather than a single spring achieves important operational advantages. For example, the specifications of the patents note that the \"use of a pair of springs . . . as opposed to the use of a single spring to support the frame structure prevents canting or twisting of the sign around a vertical axis,\" and that, if not prevented, twisting \"may cause damage to the spring structure and may result in tipping of the device.\" U.S. Patent No. 3,646,696, col. 3. In the course of patent prosecution, it was said that \"[t]he use of a pair of spring connections as opposed to a single spring connection~    ~    ~      14~      . . . forms an important part of this combination\" because it \"forc[es] the sign frame to tip along the longitudinal axis of the elongated ground-engaging members.\" App. 218. The dual-spring design affects the cost of the device as well; it was acknowledged that the device \"could use three springs but this would unnecessarily increase the cost of the device.\" App. 217. These statements made in the patent applications and in the course of procuring the patents demonstrate the functionality of the design. MDI does not assert that any of these representations are mistaken or inaccurate, and this is further strong evidence of the functionality of the dual-spring design.~    ~    III~    ~      15~      In finding for MDI on the trade dress issue the Court of Appeals gave insufficient recognition to the importance of the expired utility patents, and their evidentiary significance, in establishing the functionality of the device. The error likely was caused by its misinterpretation of trade dress principles in other respects. As we have noted, even if there has been no previous utility patent the party asserting trade dress has the burden to establish the nonfunctionality of alleged trade dress features. MDI could not meet this burden. Discussing trademarks, we have said \" '[i]n general terms, a product feature is functional,' and cannot serve as a trademark, 'if it is essential to the use or purpose of the article or if it affects the cost or quality of the article.' \" Qualitex, 514 U.S., at 165 (quoting Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 850, n. 10 (1982)). Expanding upon the meaning of this phrase, we have observed that a functional feature is one the \"exclusive use of [which] would put competitors at a significant non-reputation-related disadvantage.\" 514 U.S., at 165. The Court of Appeals in the instant case seemed to interpret this language to mean that a necessary test for functionality is \"whether the particular product configuration is a competitive necessity.\" 200 F.3d, at 940. See also Vornado, 58 F.3d, at 1507 (\"Functionality, by contrast, has been defined both by our circuit, and more recently by the Supreme Court, in terms of competitive need\").~    ~    ~      16~      This was incorrect as a comprehensive definition. As explained in Qualitex, supra, and Inwood, supra, a feature is also functional when it is essential to the use or purpose of the device or when it affects the cost or quality of the device. The Qualitex decision did not purport to displace this traditional rule. Instead, it quoted the rule as Inwood had set it forth. It is proper to inquire into a \"significant non-reputation-related disadvantage\" in cases of aesthetic functionality, the question involved in Qualitex. Where the design is functional under the Inwood formulation there is no need to proceed further to consider if there is a competitive necessity for the feature. In Qualitex, by contrast, aesthetic functionality was the central question, there having been no indication that the green-gold color of the laundry press pad had any bearing on the use or purpose of the product or its cost or quality.~    ~    ~      17~      The Court has allowed trade dress protection to certain product features that are inherently distinctive. Two Pesos, 505 U.S., at 774. In Two Pesos, however, the Court at the outset made the explicit analytic assumption that the trade dress features in question (decorations and other features to evoke a Mexican theme in a restaurant) were not functional. Id., at 767, n. 6. The trade dress in those cases did not bar competitors from copying functional product design features. In the instant case, beyond serving the purpose of informing consumers that the sign stands are made by MDI (assuming it does so), the dual-spring design provides a unique and useful mechanism to resist the force of the wind. Functionality having been established, whether MDI's dual-spring design has acquired secondary meaning need not be considered.~    ~    ~      18~      There is no need, furthermore, to engage, as did the Court of Appeals, in speculation about other design possibilities, such as using three or four springs which might serve the same purpose. 200 F.3d, at 940. Here, the functionality of the spring design means that competitors need not explore whether other spring juxtapositions might be used. The dual-spring design is not an arbitrary flourish in the configuration of MDI's product; it is the reason the device works. Other designs need not be attempted.~    ~    ~      19~      Because the dual-spring design is functional, it is unnecessary for competitors to explore designs to hide the springs, say by using a box or framework to cover them, as suggested by the Court of Appeals. Ibid. The dual-spring design assures the user the device will work. If buyers are assured the product serves its purpose by seeing the operative mechanism that in itself serves an important market need. It would be at cross-purposes to those objectives, and something of a paradox, were we to require the manufacturer to conceal the very item the user seeks.~    ~    ~      20~      In a case where a manufacturer seeks to protect arbitrary, incidental, or ornamental aspects of features of a product found in the patent claims, such as arbitrary curves in the legs or an ornamental pattern painted on the springs, a different result might obtain. There the manufacturer could perhaps prove that those aspects do not serve a purpose within the terms of the utility patent. The inquiry into whether such features, asserted to be trade dress, are functional by reason of their inclusion in the claims of an expired utility patent could be aided by going beyond the claims and examining the patent and its prosecution history to see if the feature in question is shown as a useful part of the invention. No such claim is made here, however. MDI in essence seeks protection for the dual-spring design alone. The asserted trade dress consists simply of the dual-spring design, four legs, a base, an upright, and a sign. MDI has pointed to nothing arbitrary about the components of its device or the way they are assembled. The Lanham Act does not exist to reward manufacturers for their innovation in creating a particular device; that is the purpose of the patent law and its period of exclusivity. The Lanham Act, furthermore, does not protect trade dress in a functional design simply because an investment has been made to encourage the public to associate a particular functional feature with a single manufacturer or seller. The Court of Appeals erred in viewing MDI as possessing the right to exclude competitors from using a design identical to MDI's and to require those competitors to adopt a different design simply to avoid copying it. MDI cannot gain the exclusive right to produce sign stands using the dual-spring design by asserting that consumers associate it with the look of the invention itself. Whether a utility patent has expired or there has been no utility patent at all, a product design which has a particular appearance may be functional because it is \"essential to the use or purpose of the article\" or \"affects the cost or quality of the article.\" Inwood, 456 U.S., at 850, n. 10.~    ~    ~      21~      TrafFix and some of its amici argue that the Patent Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, 8, cl. 8, of its own force, prohibits the holder of an expired utility patent from claiming trade dress protection. Brief for Petitioner 33-36; Brief for Panduit Corp. as Amicus Curiae 3; Brief for Malla Pollack as Amicus Curiae 2. We need not resolve this question. If, despite the rule that functional features may not be the subject of trade dress protection, a case arises in which trade dress becomes the practical equivalent of an expired utility patent, that will be time enough to consider the matter. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      22~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ",

They decide first whether the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of any statutory aggravating circumstance. If the jury fails to agree unanimously on the presence of a statutory aggravator, it cannot make a sentencing recommendation. In that event, the trial judge is charged with sentencing the defendant to either life imprisonment or a mandatory minimum 30-year prison term. If, on the other hand, the jury unanimously finds a statutory aggravator, it then recommends one of two potential sentences-death or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. No other sentencing option is available to the jury.~      A South Carolina jury found petitioner Shafer guilty of murder, armed robbery, and conspiracy. During the trial's sentencing phase, Shafer's counsel and the prosecutor disagreed on the application of Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154, to this case. This Court held in Simmons that where a capital defendant's future dangerousness is at issue, and the only sentencing alternative to death available to the jury is life imprisonment without possibility of parole, due process requires that the jury be informed of the defendant's parole ineligibility. Shafer's counsel maintained that Simmons required the trial judge to instruct the jury that under South Carolina law a life sentence carries no possibility of parole. The prosecutor, in opposition, urged that no Simmons instruction was required because the State did not plan to argue to the jury that Shafer would be a danger in the future. Shafer's counsel replied that the State had in fact put future dangerousness at issue by introducing evidence of a postarrest assault by Shafer and jail rules violations. The judge refused to charge on parole ineligibility, stating that future dangerousness had not been argued. The judge also denied Shafer's counsel leave to read in his closing argument lines from the controlling statute stating plainly that a life sentence in South Carolina carries no possibility of parole. After the prosecution's closing argument, Shafer's counsel renewed his plea for a life without parole instruction on the ground that the State had placed future dangerousness at issue by repeating the statements of an alarmed witness at the crime scene that Shafer and his accomplices \"might come back.\" The trial judge again denied the request. Quoting a passage from the relevant statute but not the full text, the judge twice told the jury that \"life imprisonment means until the death of the defendant.\" During its sentencing deliberations, the jury asked the judge whether, and under what circumstances, someone convicted of murder could become eligible for parole. The judge responded that \"[p]arole eligibility or ineligibility is not for your consideration.\" The jury unanimously found beyond a reasonable doubt the aggravating factor of murder while attempting armed robbery, and recommended the death penalty, which the judge imposed.~      The South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed. Without considering whether the prosecutor's evidentiary submissions or closing argument in fact placed Shafer's future dangerousness at issue, the court held Simmons generally inapplicable to the State's \"new sentencing scheme.\" Simmons is not triggered, the South Carolina court said, unless life without parole is the only legally available sentence alternative to death. Currently, the court observed, when a capital jury begins its sentencing deliberations, three alternative sentences are available: (1) death, (2) life without the possibility of parole, or (3) a mandatory minimum 30-year sentence. Since an alternative to death other than life without the possibility of parole exists, the court concluded, Simmons no longer constrains capital sentencing in South Carolina.~      Held:~      1. The South Carolina Supreme Court incorrectly interpreted Simmons when it declared the case inapplicable to South Carolina's current sentencing scheme. That court's reasoning might be persuasive if the jury's sentencing discretion actually encompassed the three choices the court identified: death, life without the possibility of parole, or a mandatory minimum 30-year sentence. But, that is not how the State's new scheme works. Under the law now governing sentencing proceedings, if the jury finds an aggravating circumstance, it must recommend a sentence, and its choices are limited to death and life without parole. When the jury makes the threshold determination whether a statutory aggravator exists, a tightly circumscribed factual inquiry, none of Simmons' due process concerns yet arise. At that stage, there are no \"misunderstanding[s]\" to avoid, no \"false choice[s]\" to guard against. See Simmons, 512 U.S., at 161 (plurality opinion). The jury, as aggravating circumstance factfinder, exercises no sentencing discretion itself. If no aggravator is found, the judge takes over and has sole authority to impose the mandatory minimum so heavily relied upon by the State Supreme Court. It is only when the jury endeavors the moral judgment whether to impose the death penalty that parole eligibility may become critical. Correspondingly, it is only at that stage that Simmons comes into play, a stage at which South Carolina law provides no third choice, no 30-year mandatory minimum, just death or life without parole. See Ramdass v. Angelone, 530 U.S. 156, 169. Thus, whenever future dangerousness is at issue in a capital sentencing proceeding under South Carolina's new scheme, due process requires that the jury be informed that a life sentence carries no possibility of parole. Pp. 10-14.~      2. South Carolina's other grounds in support of the trial judge's refusal to give Shafer's requested parole ineligibility instruction are unavailing. Pp. 14-17.~      (a) The State's argument that the jury was properly informed of the law on parole ineligibility by the trial court's instructions and by defense counsel's own argument is unpersuasive. To support that contention, the State sets out defense counsel's closing pleas that, if Shafer's life is spared, he will die in prison after spending his natural life there, as well as passages from the trial judge's instructions reiterating that life imprisonment means until the death of the defendant. Displacement of the longstanding practice of parole availability remains a relatively recent development, and common sense indicates that many jurors might not know whether a life sentence carries with it the possibility of parole. Simmons, 512 U. S, at 177-178 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). Indeed, until two years before Shafer's trial, South Carolina's law did not categorically preclude parole for capital defendants sentenced to life imprisonment. Most plainly contradicting the State's contention, the jury's written request for further instructions on the question left no doubt about the jury's failure to gain from defense counsel's closing argument or the judge's instructions any clear understanding of what a life sentence means. Cf., e.g., id., at 178. The jury's comprehension was hardly aided by the court's final instruction declaring that parole eligibility was not for the jury's consideration. That instruction did nothing to ensure that the jury was not misled and may well have been taken to mean that parole was available but that the jury, for some unstated reason, should be blind to this fact. E.g., id., at 170 (plurality opinion). Thus, although a life sentence for Shafer would permit no parole or other release under current state law, this reality was not conveyed to Shafer's jury by the court's instructions or by the arguments defense counsel was allowed to make. Pp. 14-16.~      (b) The State's contention that no parole ineligibility instruction was required under Simmons because the State never argued that Shafer would pose a future danger to society presents an issue that is not ripe for this Court's resolution. The State Supreme Court, in order to rule broadly that Simmons no longer governs capital sentencing in the State, apparently assumed, arguendo, that future dangerousness had been shown at Shafer's sentencing proceeding. Because that court did not home in on the question whether the prosecutor's evidentiary submissions or closing argument in fact placed Shafer's future dangerousness at issue, the question is left open for the state court's attention and disposition.

South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154 (1994), this Court held that where a capital defendant's future dangerousness is at issue, and the only sentencing alternative to death available to the jury is life imprisonment without possibility of parole, due process entitles the defendant \"to inform the jury of [his] parole ineligibility, either by a jury instruction or in arguments by counsel.\" Ramdass v. Angelone, 530 U.S. 156, 165 (2000) (plurality opinion) (describing Simmons' premise and plurality opinion). The case we now confront involves a death sentence returned by a jury instructed both that \"life imprisonment means until death of the offender,\" and that \"[p]arole eligibility or ineligibility is not for your consideration.\" 340 S. C. 291, 297, 531 S. E. 2d 524, 527 (2000). It presents the question whether the South Carolina Supreme Court misread our precedent when it declared Simmons inapplicable to South Carolina's current sentencing scheme. We hold that South Carolina's Supreme Court incorrectly limited Simmons and therefore reverse that court's judgment.~    ~    ~      2~      * In April 1997, in the course of an attempted robbery in Union County, South Carolina, then-18-year-old Wesley Aaron Shafer, Jr., shot and killed a convenience store cashier. A grand jury indicted Shafer on charges of murder, attempted armed robbery, and criminal conspiracy. App. 2-4. Prior to trial, the prosecutor notified Shafer that the State would seek the death penalty for the murder. App. 4-5. In that pursuit, the prosecutor further informed Shafer, the State would present evidence of Shafer's \"prior bad acts,\" as well as his \"propensity for [future] violence and unlawful conduct.\" App. 6, 8.~    ~    ~      3~      Under South Carolina law, juries in capital cases consider guilt and sentencing in separate proceedings. S. C. Code Ann. 16-3-20(A), (B) (2000 Cum. Supp.). In the initial (guilt phase) proceeding, the jury found Shafer guilty on all three charges. Governing the sentencing proceeding, South Carolina law instructs: \"[T]he jury ... shall hear additional evidence in extenuation, mitigation, or aggravation of the punishment. . . . The State, the defendant, and his counsel are permitted to present arguments for or against the sentence to be imposed.\" 16-3-20(B).~    ~    ~      4~      Under amendments effective January 1, 1996, South Carolina capital jurors face two questions at sentencing. They decide first whether the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of any statutory aggravating circumstance. If the jury fails to agree unanimously on the presence of a statutory aggravator, \"it shall not make a sentencing recommendation.\" 16-3-20(C). \"[T]he trial judge,\" in that event, \"shall sentence the defendant to either life imprisonment or a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years.\" Ibid.; see 16-3-20(B). If, on the other hand, the jury unanimously finds a statutory aggravator, it then recommends one of two potential sentences-death or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. 16-3-20(A), (B). No sentencing option other than death or life without parole is available to the jury.~    ~    ~      5~      During the sentencing proceeding in Shafer's case, the State introduced evidence of his criminal record, past aggressive conduct, probation violations, and misbehavior in prison. The State urged the statutory aggravating circumstance that Shafer had committed the murder in the course of an attempted robbery while armed with a deadly weapon. See 16-3-20(C)(a)(1)(d). The defense presented evidence of Shafer's abusive childhood and mental problems.~    ~    ~      6~      Near the completion of the parties' sentencing presentations, the trial judge conducted an in camera hearing on jury instructions. Shafer's counsel maintained that due process, and our decision in Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154 (1994), required the judge to instruct that under South Carolina law a life sentence carries no possibility of parole. The prosecutor, in opposition, urged that Shafer was not entitled to a Simmons instruction because \"the State has not argued at any point ... that he would be a danger to anybody in the future, nor will we argue [that] in our closing argument ... .\" App. 161. Shafer's counsel replied: \"The State cannot introduce evidence of future dangerousness, and then say we are not going to argue it and [thereby avoid] a charge on the law... . They have introduced [evidence of a] post arrest assault, [and] post arrest violations of the rules of the jail ... . If you put a jailer on to say that [Shafer] is charged with assault ... on [the jailer], that is future dangerousness.\" App. 162. Ruling that \"the matter of parole ineligibility will not be charged,\" the trial judge stated: \"I find that future dangerousness [was] not argued[;] if it's argued [in the prosecutor's closing], it may become different.\" App. 164.~    ~    ~      7~      Unsuccessful in his effort to gain a court instruction on parole ineligibility, Shafer's counsel sought permission to impart the information to the jury himself. He sought leave to read in his closing argument lines from the controlling statute, 16-3-20(A), stating plainly that a life sentence in South Carolina carries no possibility of parole. App. 164-165.1 In accord with the State's motion \"to prevent the defense from arguing in their closing argument anything to the effect that [Shafer] will never get out of prison,\" App. 161, the judge denied the defense permission to read the statute's text to the jury. App. 165.~    ~    ~      8~      After the prosecution's closing argument, and out of the presence of the jury, Shafer's counsel renewed his plea for \"a life without parole charge.\" App. 188. He referred to his earlier submissions and urged, in addition, that the State had placed future dangerousness at issue during closing argument by repeating the words of an alarmed witness at the crime scene: \"[T]hey [Shafer and his two accomplices] might come back, they might come back.\" App. 188. The trial judge denied the request. The judge \"admit[ted he] had some concern [as to whether the State's] argument ... had crossed the line,\" but in the end he found \"that it comes close, but did not.\" App. 191-192.~    ~    Instructing the jury, the judge explained:~    ~      9~      \"If you do not unanimously find the existence of the aggravating circumstance as set forth on the form [murder during the commission of an attempted armed robbery], you do not need to go any further.~    ~    ~      10~      \"If you find unanimously the existence of a statutory aggravating circumstance ... you will go further and continue your deliberations.~    ~    ~      11~      \"Once you have unanimously found and signed as to the presence of an aggravated circumstance, you then further deliberate, and determine whether or not Wesley Aaron Shafer should be sentence[d] to life imprisonment or death.\" App. 202.~    ~    ~      12~      The judge twice told the jury, quoting words from 16-3- 20(A), that \"life imprisonment means until the death of the defendant.\" App. 201; see App. 209. In line with his prior rulings, the judge did not instruct that a life sentence, if recommended by the jury, would be without parole. In the concluding portion of his charge, he told the jury that \"the sentence you send to me by way of a recommendation will in fact be the sentence that the court imposes on the defendant.\" App. 215. After the judge instructed the jury, the defense once more renewed its \"objection to the statutory language [on parole ineligibility] not being charged,\" App. 221, and the judge again overruled the objection, App. 222.~    ~    ~      13~      Three hours and twenty-five minutes into its sentencing deliberations, the jury sent a note to the trial judge containing two questions:~    ~    ~      14~      \"1) Is there any remote chance for someone convicted of murder to become elig[i]ble for parole?~    ~    ~      15~      \"2) Under what conditions would someone convicted for murder be elig[i]ble.\" App. 253.~    ~    ~      16~      Shafer's counsel urged the court to read to the jury the following portion of 16-3-20(A):~    ~    ~      17~      \"If the State seeks the death penalty and a statutory aggravating circumstance is found beyond a reasonable doubt ... and a recommendation of death is not made, the trial judge must impose a sentence of life imprisonment. For purposes of this section, 'life imprisonment' means until death of the offender. No person sentenced to life imprisonment pursuant to this section is eligible for parole, community supervision, or any early release program, nor is the person eligible to receive any work credits, education credits, good conduct credits, or any other credits that would reduce the mandatory life imprisonment required by this section.\" App. 226 (emphasis added).~    ~    ~      18~      He argued that the court's charge, which partially quoted from 16-3-20 (above in italics), but omitted the provision's concluding sentence (above in boldface), had left the jurors confused about Shafer's parole eligibility. App. 226. The State adhered to its position that \"the jury should not be informed as to any parole eligibility.\" App. 223. South Carolina law, the prosecutor insisted, required the judge to \"instruct the jury that it shall not consider parole eligibility in reaching its decision, and that the term life im- prisonment and a death sentence should be understood in their ordinary and plain meaning.\" App. 223-224.~    ~    ~      19~      The trial judge decided \"not ... to charge the jury about parole ineligibility,\" App. 229, and informed counsel that he would instruct: \"Your consideration is restricted to what sentence to recommend. I will, as trial judge, impose the sentence you recommend. Section 16-3-20 of the South Carolina Code of Laws provides that for the purpose of this section life imprisonment means until the death of the offender. Parole eligibility is not for your consideration.\" App. 236.~    ~    ~      20~      Shafer's counsel asked the judge \"to take off the language of parole eligibility.\" App. 236. The statement that \"parole eligibility is not to be considered by [the jury],\" counsel argued, \"impl[ies] that it is available.\" App. 236; see id., at 239 (Shafer's counsel reiterated: \"[I]f you tell them they can't consider parole eligibility ... that certainly implies that he may be eligible.\").~    ~    ~      21~      Following counsels' arguments, and nearly an hour after the jury tendered its questions, the trial judge instructed:~    ~    ~      22~      \"Section 16-3-20 of our Code of Laws as applies to this case in the process we're in, states that, quote, for the purposes of this section life imprisonment means until the death of the offender, end quote.~    ~    ~      23~      \"Parole eligibility or ineligibility is not for your consideration.\" App. 240.~    ~    ~      24~      The jury returned some 80 minutes later. It unanimously found beyond a reasonable doubt the aggravating factor of murder while attempting armed robbery, and recommended the death penalty. App. 242-243. The jury was polled, and each member indicated his or her assent to the aggravated circumstance finding and to the death penalty recommendation. App. 243-248. Defense counsel asked that the jury be polled on \"the specific question as to whether parole eligibility, their belief therein, gave rise to the verdict,\" and \"whether juror number 233 who works for probation and parole, expressed personal knowledge in the jury's deliberation outside of the evidence and the given law.\" App. 248. The judge denied both requests and imposed the death sentence. App. 248, 251.2~    ~    ~      25~      Shafer appealed his death sentence to the South Carolina Supreme Court. Noting our decision in Simmons, the South Carolina Supreme Court acknowledged that \"[w]hen the State places the defendant's future dangerousness at issue and the only available alternative sentence to the death penalty is life imprisonment without parole, due process entitles the defendant to inform the jury he is parole ineligible.\" 340 S. C. 291, 297-298, 531 S. E. 2d 524, 528 (2000). Without considering whether the prosecutor's evidentiary submissions or closing argument in fact placed Shafer's future dangerousness at issue, the court held Simmons generally inapplicable to South Carolina's \"new sentencing scheme.\" Under that scheme, life without the possibility of parole and death are not the only authorized sentences, the court said, for there is a third potential sentence, \"a mandatory minimum thirty year sentence.\" 340 S. C., at 298, 531 S. E. 2d, at 528 (citing State v. Starnes, 340 S. C. 312, 531 S. E. 2d 907 (2000) (decided the same day as Shafer)).3~    ~    ~      26~      Shafer had urged that a Simmons instruction was warranted under the new sentencing scheme, for when the jury serves as sentencer, i.e., when it finds a statutory aggravating circumstance, sentencing discretion is limited to death or life without the possibility of parole. See 340 S. C., at 298, 531 S. E. 2d, at 528. The South Carolina Supreme Court read Simmons differently. In its view, \"Simmons requires the trial judge instruct the jury the defendant is parole ineligible only if no other sentence than death, other than life without the possibility of parole, is legally available to the defendant.\" Ibid. (emphasis in original) (citing Simmons, 512 U.S., at 178 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment)). \"At the time [Shafer's] jury began its deliberations,\" the court observed, \"three alternative sentences were available\"; \"[s]ince one of these alternatives to death was not life without the possibility of parole,\" the court concluded, \"Simmons was inapplicable.\" 340 S. C., at 299, 531 S. E. 2d, at 528.~    ~    ~      27~      Chief Justice Finney dissented. \"[T]he overriding principle to be drawn from [Simmons],\" he stated, \"is that due process is violated when a jury's speculative misunderstanding about a capital defendant's parole eligibility is allowed to go uncorrected.\" Id., at 310, 531 S. E. 2d, at 534. Due process mandates reversal here, he concluded, because \"the jury's inquiry prompted a misleading response which suggested parole was a possibility.\" Ibid. Moreover, Chief Justice Finney added, when \"a capital jury inquires about parole,\" id., at 310, n. 2, 531 S. E. 2d, at 534, n. 2, even if the question \"is simply one of policy, as the majority suggests [it is], then why not adopt a policy which gives the jurors the simpl[e] truth: no parole.\" Id., at 311, 531 S. E. 2d, at 534.~    ~    ~      28~      We granted certiorari, 530 U.S. 1306 (2000), to determine whether the South Carolina Supreme Court properly held Simmons inapplicable to the State's current sentencing regime. We conclude that South Carolina's Supreme Court misinterpreted Simmons, and we therefore reverse that court's judgment.~    ~    II~    ~      29~      South Carolina has consistently refused to inform the jury of a capital defendant's parole eligibility status.4 We first confronted this practice in Simmons. The South Carolina sentencing scheme then in effect, S. C. Code Ann. 16-3-20(A) and 24-21-610 (Supp. 1993), did not categorically preclude parole for capital defendants sentenced to life imprisonment, see supra, at 8-9, n. 3. Simmons, however, was parole ineligible under that scheme because of prior convictions for crimes of violence. See 24-21-640; Simmons, 512 U.S., at 156 (plurality opinion); id., at 176 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). Simmons' jury, in a note to the judge during the penalty phase deliberations, asked: \"Does the imposition of a life sentence carry with it the possibility of parole?\" Id., at 160 (plurality opinion). Over defense counsel's objection, the trial judge in Simmons instructed: \"Do not consider parole or parole eligibility [in reaching your verdict]. That is not a proper issue for your consideration.\" Ibid. After receiving this response from the court, Simmons' jury returned a sentence of death, which Simmons unsuccessfully sought to overturn on appeal to the South Carolina Supreme Court. Id., at 160-161.~    ~    ~      30~      Mindful of the \"longstanding practice of parole availability,\" id., at 177 (O'Connor, J.), we recognized that Simmons' jury, charged to chose between death and life imprisonment, may have been misled. Given no clear definition of \"life imprisonment\" and told not to consider parole eligibility, that jury \"reasonably may have believed that [Simmons] could be released on parole if he were not executed.\" Id., at 161 (plurality opinion); see id., at 177-178 (O'Connor, J.). It did not comport with due process, we held, for the State to \"secur[e] a death sentence on the ground, at least in part, of [defendant's] future dangerousness, while at the same time concealing from the sentencing jury the true meaning of its [only] noncapital sentencing alternative, namely, that life imprisonment meant life without parole.\" Id., at 162 (plurality opinion); see id., at 178 (O'Connor, J.) (\"Where the State puts the defendant's future dangerousness in issue, and the only available alternative sentence to death is life imprisonment without possibility of parole, due process entitles the defendant to inform the capital sentencing jury-by either argument or instruction-that he is parole ineligible.\").~    ~    ~      31~      As earlier stated, see supra, at 8-9, the South Carolina Supreme Court held Simmons \"inapplicable under the [State's] new sentencing scheme,\" 340 S. C., at 298, 531 S. E. 2d, at 528. Simmons is not triggered the South Carolina court said, unless life without parole is \"the only legally available sentence alternative to death.\" Ibid. Currently, the court observed, when a capital case jury begins its sentencing deliberations, three alternative sentences are available: \"1) death, 2) life without the possibility of parole, or 3) a mandatory minimum thirty year sentence.\" Ibid. \"Since one of these alternatives to death [is] not life without the possibility of parole,\" the court concluded, Simmons no longer constrains capital sentencing in South Carolina. 340 S. C., at 299, 531 S. E. 2d, at 528.~    ~    ~      32~      This reasoning might be persuasive if the jury's sentencing discretion encompassed the three choices the South Carolina court identified. But, that is not how the State's new scheme works. See supra, at 2-3. Under the law now governing, in any case in which the jury does not unanimously find a statutory aggravator, death is not a permissible sentence and Simmons has no relevance. In such a case, the judge alone becomes the sentencer. S. C. Code Ann. 16-3-20(C) (2000 Cum. Supp.). Only if the jury finds an aggravating circumstance does it decide on the sentence. Ibid. And when it makes that decision, as was the case in Simmons, only two sentences are legally available under South Carolina law: death or life without the possibility of parole. Ibid.~    ~    ~      33~      The South Carolina Supreme Court was no doubt correct to this extent: At the time the trial judge instructed the jury in Shafer's case, it was indeed possible that Shafer would receive a sentence other than death or life without the possibility of parole. That is so because South Carolina, in line with other States, gives capital juries, at the penalty phase, discrete and sequential functions. Initially, capital juries serve as factfinders in determining whether an alleged aggravating circumstance exists. Once that factual threshold is passed, the jurors exercise discretion in determining the punishment that ought to be imposed. The trial judge in Shafer's case recognized the critical difference in the two functions. He charged that \"[a] statutory aggravating circumstance is a fact, an incident, a detail or an occurrence,\" the existence of which must be found beyond a reasonable doubt. App. 203. Turning to the sentencing choice, he referred to considerations of \"fairness and mercy,\" and the defendant's \"moral culpability.\" App. 204. He also instructed that the jury was free to decide \"whether ... for any reason or no reason at all Mr. Shafer should be sentenced to life imprisonment rather than to death.\" App. 203.~    ~    ~      34~      In sum, when the jury determines the existence of a statutory aggravator, a tightly circumscribed factual inquiry, none of Simmons' due process concerns arise. There are no \"misunderstanding[s]\" to avoid, no \"false choice[s]\" to guard against. See Simmons, 512 U.S., at 161 (plurality opinion). The jury, as aggravating circumstance factfinder, exercises no sentencing discretion itself. If no aggravator is found, the judge takes over and has sole authority to impose the mandatory minimum so heavily relied upon by the South Carolina Supreme Court. See supra, at 8-9, 12. It is only when the jury endeavors the moral judgment whether to impose the death penalty that parole eligibility may become critical. Correspondingly, it is only at that stage that Simmons comes into play, a stage at which South Carolina law provides no third choice, no 30-year mandatory minimum, just death or life without parole. See Ramdass, 530 U.S., at 169 (Simmons applies where \"as a legal matter, there is no possibility of parole if the jury decides the appropriate sentence is life in prison.\" (emphasis added)).5 We therefore hold that whenever future dangerousness is at issue in a capital sentencing proceeding under South Carolina's new scheme, due process requires that the jury be informed that a life sentence carries no possibility of parole.~    ~    III~    ~      35~      South Carolina offers two other grounds in support of the trial judge's refusal to give Shafer's requested parole ineligibility instruction. First, the State argues that the jury was properly informed of the law on parole ineligibility by the trial court's instructions and by defense counsel's own argument. Second, the State contends that no parole ineligibility instruction was required under Simmons because the State never argued Shafer would pose a future danger to society. We now turn to those arguments.~    ~    ~      36~      * \"Even if this Court finds Simmons was triggered,\" the State urges, \"the defense's closing argument and the judge's charge fulfilled the requirements of Simmons.\" Brief for Respondent 38. To support that contention, the State sets out defense counsel's closing pleas that, if Shafer's life is spared, he will \"die in prison\" after \"spend[ing] his natural life there.\" Id., at 39. Next, the State recites passages from the trial judge's instructions reiterating that \"life imprisonment means until the death of the defendant.\" Id., at 40.~    ~    ~      37~      The South Carolina Supreme Court, we note, never suggested that counsel's arguments or the trial judge's instructions satisfied Simmons. That court simply held Simmons inapplicable under the State's new sentencing scheme. 340 S. C., at 298, 531 S. E. 2d, at 528. We do not find the State's position persuasive. Displacement of \"the longstanding practice of parole availability\" remains a relatively recent development, and \"common sense tells us that many jurors might not know whether a life sentence carries with it the possibility of parole.\" Simmons, 512 U.S., at 177-178 (O'Connor, J.). South Carolina's situation is illustrative. Until two years before Shafer's trial, as we earlier noted, the State's law did not categorically preclude parole for capital defendants sentenced to life imprisonment. See supra, at 8-9, n. 3, and 10-11.~    ~    ~      38~      Most plainly contradicting the State's contention, Shafer's jury left no doubt about its failure to gain from defense counsel's closing argument or the judge's instructions any clear understanding of what a life sentence means. The jurors sought further instruction, asking: \"Is there any remote chance for someone convicted of murder to become elig[i]ble for parole?\" App. 253; cf. Simmons, 512 U.S., at 178 (O'Connor, J.) (\"that the jury in this case felt compelled to ask whether parole was available shows that the jurors did not know whether or not a life-sentenced defendant will be released from prison\").6~    ~    ~      39~      The jury's comprehension was hardly aided by the court's final instruction: \"Parole eligibility or ineligibility is not for your consideration.\" App. 240. That instruction did nothing to ensure that the jury was not misled and may well have been taken to mean \"that parole was available but that the jury, for some unstated reason, should be blind to this fact.\" Simmons, 512 U.S., at 170 (plurality opinion); see 340 S. C., at 310, 531 S. E. 2d, at 534 (Finney, C. J., dissenting) (\"[T]he jury's inquiry prompted a misleading response which suggested parole was a possibility.\"); State v. Kelly, No. 25226, 2001 WL 21321, *13 (S. C., Jan. 8, 2001) (Pleicones, J., dissenting in part, concurring in part) (\"Without the knowledge that, if aggravators are found, a life sentence is not subject to being reduced by parole, or any other method of early release, the jury is likely to speculate unnecessarily on the possibility of early release, and impose a sentence of death based upon 'fear rather than reason.' \" (quoting Yarbrough v. Commonwealth, 258 Va. 347, 369, 519 S. E. 2d 602, 613 (1999))).~    ~    ~      40~      In sum, a life sentence for Shafer would permit no \"parole, community supervision, ... early release program, ... or any other credits that would reduce the mandatory imprisonment,\" S. C. Code Ann. 16-3-20(A) (2000 Cum. Supp.) (set out supra, at 4, n. 1); this reality was not conveyed to Shafer's jury by the court's instructions or by the arguments defense counsel was allowed to make.~    ~    B~    ~      41~      Ultimately, the State maintains that \"[t]he prosecution did not argue future dangerousness,\" so the predicate for a Simmons charge is not present here. Brief for Respondent 42. That issue is not ripe for our resolution.~    ~    ~      42~      In the trial court, the prosecutor and defense counsel differed on what it takes to place future dangerousness \"at issue.\" The prosecutor suggested that the State must formally argue future dangerousness. App. 161. Defense counsel urged that once the prosecutor introduces evidence showing future dangerousness, the State cannot avoid a Simmons charge by saying the point was not argued or calling the evidence by another name. See App. 161-162.~    ~    ~      43~      As earlier recounted, the trial judge determined that future dangerousness was not at issue, but acknowledged, at one point, that the prosecutor had come close to crossing the line. See supra, at 3-4, 5. The South Carolina Supreme Court, in order to rule broadly that Simmons no longer governs capital sentencing in the State, apparently assumed, arguendo, that future dangerousness had been shown at Shafer's sentencing proceeding. See supra, at 8-9; cf. Kelly, 2001 WL 21321, at *6 (recognizing that future dangerousness is an issue when it is \"a logical inference from the evidence\" or was \"injected into the case through the State's closing argument\"). Because the South Carolina Supreme Court did not home in on the question whether the prosecutor's evidentiary submissions or closing argument in fact placed Shafer's future dangerousness at issue, we leave that question open for the state court's attention and disposition.~    ~    ~      44~      * * *~    ~    ~      45~      For the reasons stated, the judgment of the South Carolina Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      46~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         Section 16-3-20(A) reads: \"A person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to murder must be punished by death, by imprisonment for life, or by a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years. If the State seeks the death penalty and a statutory aggravating circumstance is found beyond a reasonable doubt pursuant to subsections (B) and (C), and a recommendation of death is not made, the trial judge must impose a sentence of life imprisonment. For purposes of this section, 'life imprisonment' means until death of the offender. No person sentenced to life imprisonment pursuant to this section is eligible for parole, community supervision, or any early release program, nor is the person eligible to receive any work credits, education credits, good conduct credits, or any other credits that would reduce the mandatory life imprisonment required by this section. No person sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years pursuant to this section is eligible for parole or any early release program, nor is the person eligible to receive any work credits, education credits, good conduct credits, or any other credits that would reduce the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years required by this section. . . . When the Governor commutes a sentence of death to life imprisonment under the provisions of Section 14 of Article IV of the Constitution of South Carolina, 1895, the commutee is not eligible for parole, community supervision, or any early release program, nor is the person eligible to receive any work credits, good conduct credits, education credits, or any other credits that would reduce the mandatory imprisonment required by this subsection.\"~      ~      ~        2~         The judge also sentenced Shafer to consecutive terms of 20 years in prison for the attempted armed robbery and 5 years in prison for the criminal conspiracy. App. 251-252.~      ~      ~        3~         South Carolina's \"new\" sentencing scheme changed the punishments available for a capital murder conviction that did not result in a death sentence. The capital sentencing law in effect at the time we decided Simmons read: \"A person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to murder must be punished by death or by imprisonment for life and is not eligible for parole until the service of twenty years; provided, however, that when the State seeks the death penalty and an aggravating circumstance is specifically found beyond a reasonable doubt ... , and a recommendation of death is not made, the court must impose a sentence of life imprisonment without eligibility for parole until the service of thirty years.\" S. C. Code Ann. 16-3-20(A) (Supp. 1993). What made Simmons parole ineligible was the provision stating: \"The board must not grant parole nor is parole authorized to any prisoner serving a sentence for a second or subsequent conviction, following a separate sentencing for a prior conviction, for violent crimes . . . .\" 24-21-640. This latter provision has not been amended; however, it did not apply to Shafer. Here, we consider whether South Carolina's wholesale elimination of parole for capital defendants sentenced to life in prison, see S. C. Code Ann. 16-3-20 (2000 Cum. Supp.), described supra, at 2-3, requires a Simmons instruction in all South Carolina capital cases in which future dangerousness is \"at issue.\"~      ~      ~        4~         At the time we decided Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154 (1994), South Carolina was one of only three States-Pennsylvania and Virginia were the others-that \"ha[d] a life-without-parole sentencing alternative to capital punishment for some or all convicted murderers but refuse[d] to inform sentencing juries of th[at] fact.\" Id., at 168, n. 8. Since Simmons, Virginia has abandoned this practice. Yarbrough v. Commonwealth, 258 Va. 347, 374, 519 S. E. 2d 602, 616 (1999) (\"[W]e hold that in the penalty-determination phase of a trial where the defendant has been convicted of capital murder, in response to a proffer of a proper instruction from the defendant prior to submitting the issue of penalty-determination to the jury or where the defendant asks for such an instruction following an inquiry from the jury during deliberations, the trial court shall instruct the jury that the words 'imprisonment for life' mean 'imprisonment for life without possibility of parole.' \").5 Tellingly, the State acknowledged at oral argument that if future dangerousness was a factor, and the jury first reported finding an aggravator before going on to its sentencing recommendation, a Simmons charge would at that point be required. Tr. of Oral Arg. 32. We see no significant difference between that situation and the one presented here. Nor does Justice Thomas' dissent in this case plausibly urge any such distinction. See post, at 2-3. If the jurors should be told life means no parole in the hypothesized bifurcated sentencing proceeding, they should be equally well informed in the actual uninterrupted proceeding.~      ~      ~        6~         Animating Justice Thomas' dissent is the conviction that the limited information defense counsel was allowed to convey and the judge's charge \"left no room for speculation by the jury.\" Post, at 2. The full record scarcely supports, and we do not share, that conviction. Cf. 340 S. C. 291, 310-311, 531 S. E. 2d 524, 534 (2000) (Finney, C. J., dissenting) (\"the jury's inquiry prompted a misleading response\" that did not reveal the \"simpl[e] truth\").       Scalia, J., dissenting~      ~    ~    ~      47~      Justice Scalia, dissenting.~    ~    ~      48~      While I concede that today's judgment is a logical extension of Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154 (1994), I am more attached to the logic of the Constitution, whose Due Process Clause was understood as an embodiment of common-law tradition, rather than as authority for federal courts to promulgate wise national rules of criminal procedure.~    ~    ~      49~      As I pointed out in Simmons, that common-law tradition does not contain special jury-instruction requirements for capital cases. Today's decision is the second page of the \"whole new chapter\" of our improvised \" 'death-is-different' jurisprudence\" that Simmons began. Id., at 185 (Scalia, J., dissenting). The third page (or the fourth or fifth) will be the (logical-enough) extension of this novel requirement to cases in which the jury did not inquire into the possibility of parole. Providing such information may well be a good idea (though it will sometimes harm rather than help the defendant's case)-and many States have indeed required it. See App. B to Brief for Petitioner. The Constitution, however, does not. I would limit Simmons to its facts.~    ~    Thomas, J., dissenting~    ~      50~      Justice Thomas, dissenting.~    ~    ~      51~      For better or, as I believe, worse, the majority's decision in this case is the logical next step after Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154 (1994). Now, whenever future dangerousness is placed at issue and the jury's potential sentencing choice is between life without parole and death, the trial court must instruct the jury on the impossibility of release even if there is an alternative sentence available to the court under which the defendant could be released. However, even accepting that sentencing courts in South Carolina must now permit the jury to learn about the impossibility of parole when life imprisonment is a sentencing possibility, I believe that the court's instructions and the arguments made by counsel in Shafer's case were sufficient to inform the jury of what \"life imprisonment\" meant for Shafer. I therefore respectfully dissent.~    ~    ~      52~      In Simmons, a majority of this Court was concerned that the jury in Simmons' trial reasonably could have believed that, if he were sentenced to life, he would be eligible for parole. See id., at 161 (plurality opinion); id., at 177-178 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). Therefore, Simmons' defense to future dangerousness-that because he sexually assaulted only elderly women, he would pose no danger to fellow inmates, see id., at 157 (plurality opinion)-would not have been effective. To correct the jury's possible misunderstanding of the availability of parole, Simmons requested several jury instructions, including one that would explain that, if he were sentenced to life imprisonment, \" 'he actually w[ould] be sentenced to imprisonment in the state penitentiary for the balance of his natural life.' \" Id., at 160. The trial court rejected this instruction and instead ambiguously informed the jury that the term life imprisonment is to be understood according to its \" 'plain and ordinary meaning,' \" which did \"nothing to dispel the misunderstanding reasonable jurors may have about the way in which any particular State defines 'life imprisonment.' \" Id., at 169-170.~    ~    ~      53~      In this case, by contrast, the judge repeatedly explained that \" 'life imprisonment means until the death of the defendant.' \" App. 201. The judge defined \" 'life imprisonment' \" as \" 'incarceration of the defendant until his death,' \" id., at 209, and informed the jury that, if it chose the punishment of life imprisonment, the verdict form would read \" 'We, the jury ... unanimously recommend that the defendant, Wesley Aaron Shafer, be imprisoned in the state penitentiary for the balance of his natural life.' \" Id., at 213-214. Emphasizing this very point, Shafer's counsel argued to the jury that Shafer would never leave prison if he received a life sentence. See id., at 192 (\" 'The question is will the State execute him or will he just die in prison' \"); id., at 194 (\" 'putting a 19 year old in prison until he is dead' \" and \" 'you can put him some place until he is dead' \"); id., at 198 (\" 'When they say give [him] life, he's not going home... . I'm just asking for the smallest amount of mercy it takes to make a man, a child spend the rest of his life in prison' \").~    ~    ~      54~      Given these explanations of what life imprisonment means, which left no room for speculation by the jury, I can only infer that the jury's questions regarding parole referred not to Shafer's parole eligibility in the event the jury sentenced Shafer to life, but rather to his parole eligibility in the event it did not sentence him at all. In fact, both of the jury's questions referred only to parole eligibility of someone \" 'convicted of murder,' \" id., at 239-240 (\" '[I]s there any remote chance that someone convicted of murder could become eligible for parole.' \"); id., at 240 (\" '[U]nder what conditions would someone convicted for murder be eligible [for parole]' \"), rather than parole eligibility of someone sentenced to life imprisonment. Under South Carolina law, if the jury does not find an aggravating circumstance, someone convicted of murder could be sentenced to a term of 30 years' imprisonment or greater. See S. C. Code Ann. 16-3-20(C) (2000 Cum. Supp.). If the jury thought Shafer's release from prison was a possibility in the event the judge sentenced him, they would have been correct. To be sure, under South Carolina's sentencing scheme, the jury did not need to know what sentencing options were available to the judge in the event the jury did not find an aggravating circumstance. But that is precisely why the trial court's answers were appropriate. It explained what \"life\" meant for purposes of the jury's sentencing option, and then added that \" '[p]arole eligibility or ineligibility is not for your consideration.' \" App. 240.~    ~    ~      55~      The majority appears to believe that it could develop jury instructions that are more precise than those offered to Shafer's jury. It may well be right. But it is not this Court's role to micromanage state sentencing proceedings or to develop model jury instructions. I would decline to interfere further with matters that the Constitution leaves to the States.~    ~    ",

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.PAULA L. BUFORD, PETITIONERv.UNITED STATES~    No. 99-9073.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued January 8, 2001~    Decided March 20, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      The United States Sentencing Guidelines, as relevant here, define a career offender as one with at least two prior felony convictions for violent or drug-related crimes and provide that a sentencing judge must count as a single prior conviction all \"related\" convictions, advising that they are \"related\" when, inter alia, they were consolidated for sentencing. The Seventh Circuit has held that because two prior convictions might have been consolidated for sentencing, and hence related, even if a sentencing court did not enter a formal consolidation order, a court should decide whether such convictions were nonetheless functionally consolidated, meaning that they were factually or logically related and sentencing was joint. Petitioner Buford pleaded guilty to armed bank robbery. At sentencing, the Government conceded that her four prior robbery convictions were related, but did not concede that her prior drug conviction was related to the robberies. The District Court decided that the drug and robbery cases had not been consolidated, either formally or functionally, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed, reviewing the District Court's decision deferentially rather than de novo.~      Held: Deferential review is appropriate when an appeals court reviews a trial court's Sentencing Guideline determination as to whether an offender's prior convictions were consolidated for sentencing. The relevant federal sentencing statute requires a reviewing court not only to \"accept\" a district court's \"findings of fact\" (unless \"clearly erroneous\"), but also to \"give due deference to the court's application of the guidelines to the facts.\" 18 U.S.C.  3742(e) (emphasis added). The \"deference that is due depends on the nature of the question presented.\" Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 98. Although Buford argues that the nature of the question here-applying a Guideline term to undisputed facts-demands no deference at all, the district court is in a better position than the appellate court to decide whether individual circumstances demonstrate functional consolidation. Experience with trials, sentencing, and consolidation procedures will help a district judge draw the proper inferences from the procedural descriptions provided. In addition, factual nuance may closely guide the legal decision, with legal results depending heavily upon an understanding of the significance of case-specific details. And the decision's fact-bound nature limits the value of appellate court precedent, which may provide only minimal help when other courts consider other procedural circumstances, state systems, and crimes. Insofar as greater uniformity is necessary, the Sentencing Commission can provide it. Pp. 4-7.~      201 F.3d 937, affirmed.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT~      Breyer, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      This case raises a narrow question of sentencing law. What standard of review applies when a court of appeals reviews a trial court's Sentencing Guideline determination as to whether an offender's prior convictions were consolidated, hence \"related,\" for purposes of sentencing? In particular, should the appeals court review the trial court's decision deferentially or de novo? We conclude, as did the Court of Appeals, that deferential review is appropriate, and we affirm.~    ~    ~      2~      * A~    ~    ~      3~      The trial court decision at issue focused on one aspect of the United States Sentencing Guidelines' treatment of \"career offenders,\" a category of offender subject to particularly severe punishment. The Guidelines define a \"career offender\" as an offender with \"at least two prior felony convictions\" for violent or drug-related crimes. United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual 4B1.1 (Nov. 2000) (USSG). At the same time, they provide that a sentencing judge must count as a single prior felony conviction all those that are \"related\" to one another. USSG 4B1.2(c), and comment., n. 3; 4A1.2(a)(2). And they advise (in an application note) that prior convictions are \"related\" to one another when, inter alia, they \"were consolidated for . . . sentencing.\" 4A1.2, comment., n. 3.~    ~    ~      4~      The Seventh Circuit has refined this \"prior conviction\" doctrine yet further. It has held that two prior convictions might have been \"consolidated for sentencing,\" and hence \"related,\" even if the sentencing court did not enter any formal order of consolidation. See United States v. Joseph, 50 F.3d 401, 404, cert. denied, 516 U. S 847 (1995). In such an instance, the Circuit has said, a court should decide whether the convictions were nonetheless \"functionally consolidated,\" which means that the convictions were \"factually or logically related, and sentencing was joint.\" 201 F.3d 937, 940 (2000) (emphasis added).~    ~    B~    ~      5~      This case concerns \"functional consolidation.\" Paula Buford pleaded guilty to armed bank robbery, a crime of violence, in federal court. The federal sentencing judge had to decide whether Buford's five 1992 Wisconsin state-court convictions were \"related\" to one another, and consequently counted as one single prior conviction, or whether they should count as more than one.~    ~    ~      6~      The Government conceded that four of the five prior convictions were \"related\" to one another. These four involved a series of gas station robberies. All four had been the subject of a single criminal indictment, and Buford had pleaded guilty to all four at the same time in the same court. See USSG 4A1.2, comment., n. 3 (prior offenses are \"related\" if \"consolidated for trial or sentencing\").~    ~    ~      7~      The Government did not concede, however, that the fifth conviction, for a drug crime, was \"related\" to the other four. The drug crime (possession of, with intent to deliver, cocaine) had taken place about the same time as the fourth robbery, and Buford claimed that the robberies had been motivated by her drug addiction. But the only evidentiary link among the crimes was that the police had discovered the cocaine when searching Buford's house after her arrest for the robberies. Moreover, no formal order of consolidation had been entered. The State had charged the drug offense in a separate indictment and had assigned a different prosecutor to handle the drug case. A different judge had heard Buford plead guilty to the drug charge in a different hearing held on a different date; two different state prosecutors had appeared before the sentencing court, one discussing drugs, the other discussing the robberies; and the sentencing court had entered two separate judgments.~    ~    ~      8~      Buford, without denying these facts, nonetheless pointed to other circumstances that, in her view, showed that the drug crime conviction had been \"consolidated\" with the robbery convictions for sentencing, rendering her drug conviction and robbery convictions \"related.\" She pointed out that the State had sent the four robbery cases for sentencing to the very same judge who had heard and accepted her plea of guilty to the drug charge; that the judge had heard arguments about sentencing in all five cases at the same time in a single proceeding; that the judge had issued sentences for all five crimes at the same time; and that the judge, having imposed three sentences for the five crimes (6 years for the drug crime, 12 years for two robberies, and 15 years for the other two), had ordered all three to run concurrently.~    ~    ~      9~      The District Court, placing greater weight on the former circumstances than on the latter, decided that the drug case and the robbery cases had not been consolidated for sentencing, either formally or functionally. Buford appealed. The Court of Appeals found the \"functional consolidation\" question a close one, and wrote that \"the standard of appellate review may be dispositive.\" 201 F.3d, at 940. It decided to review the District Court's decision \"deferentially\" rather than \"de novo.\" Id., at 942. And it affirmed that decision. Ibid.~    ~    ~      10~      Buford sought certiorari. In light of the different Circuits' different approaches to the problem, we granted the writ. Compare United States v. Irons, 196 F.3d 634, 638 (CA6 1999) (relatedness decision reviewed for clear error); United States v. Wiseman, 172 F.3d 1196, 1219 (CA10) (same), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 889 (1999); United States v. Mapp, 170 F.3d 328, 338 (CA2) (same), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 901 (1999); United States v. Maza, 93 F.3d 1390, 1400 (CA8 1996) (same), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1138 (1997); United States v. Mullens, 65 F.3d 1560, 1565 (CA11 1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1112 (1996) (same), with United States v. Garcia, 962 F.2d 479, 481 (CA5) (relatedness determination reviewed de novo), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 902 (1992); United States v. Davis, 922 F.2d 1385, 1388 (CA9 1991) (same).~    ~    II~    ~      11~      In arguing for de novo review, Buford points out that she has not contested any relevant underlying issue of fact. She disagrees only with the District Court's legal conclusion that a legal label-\"functional consolidation\"-failed to fit the undisputed facts. She concedes, as she must, that this circumstance does not dispose of the standard of review question. That is because the relevant federal sentencing statute requires a reviewing court not only to \"accept\" a district court's \"findings of fact\" (unless \"clearly erroneous\"), but also to \"give due deference to the district court's application of the guidelines to the facts.\" 18 U.S.C.  3742(e) (emphasis added). And that is the kind of determination-application of the Guidelines to the facts-that is at issue here. Hence the question we must answer is what kind of \"deference\" is \"due.\" And, as we noted in Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 98 (1996), the \"deference that is due depends on the nature of the question presented.\"~    ~    ~      12~      Buford argues that the nature of the question presented here-applying a Sentencing Guidelines term to undisputed facts-demands no deference at all. That is to say, the deference \"due\" is no deference; hence the Court of Appeals should have reviewed the trial court's decision de novo. Buford points out that, because the underlying facts are not in dispute, witness credibility is not important. She adds that de novo appellate review will help clarify and make meaningful the consolidation-related legal principles at issue. And she says that de novo review will help avoid inconsistent trial court determinations about consolidation, thereby furthering the Guidelines' effort to bring consistency to sentencing law.~    ~    ~      13~      Despite these arguments, we believe that the appellate court was right to review this trial court decision deferentially rather than de novo. In Koon, we based our selection of an abuse-of-discretion standard of review on the relative institutional advantages enjoyed by the district court in making the type of determination at issue. See id., at 98-99; cf. Miller v. Fenton, 474 U.S. 104, 114 (1985) (deference may depend on whether \"one judicial actor is better positioned than another to decide the issue in question\"). We concluded there that the special competence of the district court helped to make deferential review appropriate. And that is true here as well. That is to say, the district court is in a better position than the appellate court to decide whether a particular set of individual circumstances demonstrates \"functional consolidation.\"~    ~    ~      14~      That is so because a district judge sees many more \"consolidations\" than does an appellate judge. As a trial judge, a district judge is likely to be more familiar with trial and sentencing practices in general, including consolidation procedures. And as a sentencing judge who must regularly review and classify defendants' criminal histories, a district judge is more likely to be aware of which procedures the relevant state or federal courts typically follow. Experience with trials, sentencing, and consolidations will help that judge draw the proper inferences from the procedural descriptions provided.~    ~    ~      15~      In addition, factual nuance may closely guide the legal decision, with legal results depending heavily upon an understanding of the significance of case-specific details. See Koon v. United States, supra, at 98-99 (District Court's detailed understanding of the case before it and experience with other sentencing cases favored deferential review); Cooter  Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 403-404 (1990) (fact-intensive nature of decision whether to impose sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 made deferential review appropriate); Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, 560 (1988) (District Court's familiarity with facts of case warranted deferential review of determination whether Government's legal position was \"substantially justified\"). In a case like this one, for example, under Seventh Circuit doctrine, the District Judge usefully might have considered the factual details of the crimes at issue in order to determine whether factual connections among those crimes, rather than, say, administrative convenience, led Wisconsin to sentence Buford simultaneously and concurrently for the robbery and drug offenses. See United States v. Joseph, 50 F.3d, at 404; United States v. Russell, 2 F.3d 200, 204 (CA7 1993).~    ~    ~      16~      Nor can we place determinative weight upon the heightened uniformity benefits that Buford contends will result from de novo review. The legal question at issue is a minor, detailed, interstitial question of sentencing law, buried in a judicial interpretation of an application note to a Sentencing Guideline. That question is not a generally recurring, purely legal matter, such as interpreting a set of legal words, say, those of an individual guideline, in order to determine their basic intent. Nor is that question readily resolved by reference to general legal principles and standards alone. Rather, the question at issue grows out of, and is bounded by, case-specific detailed factual circumstances. And the fact-bound nature of the decision limits the value of appellate court precedent, which may provide only minimal help when other courts consider other procedural circumstances, other state systems, and other crimes. In any event, the Sentencing Commission itself gathers information on the sentences imposed by different courts, it views the sentencing process as a whole, it has developed a broad perspective on sentencing practices throughout the Nation, and it can, by adjusting the Guidelines or the application notes, produce more consistent sentencing results among similarly situated offenders sentenced by different courts. Insofar as greater uniformity is necessary, the Commission can provide it. Cf. Braxton v. United States, 500 U.S. 344, 347-348 (1991) (Congress intended Sentencing Commission to play primary role in resolving conflicts over interpretation of Guidelines).~    ~    III~    ~      17~      In light of the fact-bound nature of the legal decision, the comparatively greater expertise of the District Court, and the limited value of uniform court of appeals precedent, we conclude that the Court of Appeals properly reviewed the District Court's \"functional consolidation\" decision deferentially. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is Affirmed.~    ~    ",

FERGUSON, et al., PETITIONERSv.CITY OF CHARLESTON et al.~    No. 99-936.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued October 4, 2000~    Decided March 21, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      In the fall of 1988, staff members at the Charleston public hospital operated by the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) became concerned about an apparent increase in the use of cocaine by patients who were receiving prenatal treatment. When the incidence of cocaine use among maternity patients remained unchanged despite referrals for counseling and treatment of patients who tested positive for that drug, MUSC staff offered to cooperate with the city in prosecuting mothers whose children tested positive for drugs at birth. Accordingly, a task force made up of MUSC representatives, police, and local officials developed a policy which set forth procedures for identifying and testing pregnant patients suspected of drug use; required that a chain of custody be followed when obtaining and testing patients' urine samples; provided for education and treatment referral for patients testing positive; contained police procedures and criteria for arresting patients who tested positive; and prescribed prosecutions for drug offenses and/or child neglect, depending on the stage of the defendant's pregnancy. Other than the provisions describing the substance abuse treatment to be offered women testing positive, the policy made no mention of any change in the prenatal care of such patients, nor did it prescribe any special treatment for the newborns. Petitioners, MUSC obstetrical patients arrested after testing positive for cocaine, filed this suit challenging the policy's validity on, inter alia, the theory that warrantless and nonconsensual drug tests conducted for criminal investigatory purposes were unconstitutional searches. Among its actions, the District Court instructed the jury to find for petitioners unless they had consented to such searches. The jury found for respondents, and petitioners appealed, arguing that the evidence was not sufficient to support the jury's consent finding. In affirming without reaching the consent question, the Fourth Circuit held that the searches in question were reasonable as a matter of law under this Court's cases recognizing that \"special needs\" may, in certain exceptional circumstances, justify a search policy designed to serve non-law-enforcement ends.~      Held: A state hospital's performance of a diagnostic test to obtain evidence of a patient's criminal conduct for law enforcement purposes is an unreasonable search if the patient has not consented to the procedure. The interest in using the threat of criminal sanctions to deter pregnant women from using cocaine cannot justify a departure from the general rule that an official nonconsensual search is unconstitutional if not authorized by a valid warrant. Pp. 8-18.~      (a) Because MUSC is a state hospital, its staff members are government actors subject to the Fourth Amendment's strictures. New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U.S. 325, 335-337. Moreover, the urine tests at issue were indisputably searches within that Amendment's meaning. Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn., 489 U.S. 602, 617. Furthermore, both lower courts viewed the case as one involving MUSC's right to conduct searches without warrants or probable cause, and this Court must assume for purposes of decision that the tests were performed without the patients' informed consent. Pp. 8-9.~      (b) Because the hospital seeks to justify its authority to conduct drug tests and to turn the results over to police without the patients' knowledge or consent, this case differs from the four previous cases in which the Court considered whether comparable drug tests fit within the closely guarded category of constitutionally permissible suspicionless searches. See Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 309; see also Skinner, Von Raab, and Acton. Those cases employed a balancing test weighing the intrusion on the individual's privacy interest against the \"special needs\" that supported the program. The invasion of privacy here is far more substantial than in those cases. In previous cases, there was no misunderstanding about the purpose of the test or the potential use of the test results, and there were protections against the dissemination of the results to third parties. Moreover, those cases involved disqualification from eligibility for particular benefits, not the unauthorized dissemination of test results. The critical difference, however, lies in the nature of the \"special need\" asserted. In each of the prior cases, the \"special need\" was one divorced from the State's general law enforcement interest. Here, the policy's central and indispensable feature from its inception was the use of law enforcement to coerce patients into substance abuse treatment. Respondents' assertion that their ultimate purpose-namely, protecting the health of both mother and child-is a benificent one is unavailing. While the ultimate goal of the program may well have been to get the women in question into substance abuse treatment and off drugs, the immediate objective of the searches was to generate evidence for law enforcement purposes in order to reach that goal. Given that purpose and given the extensive involvement of law enforcement officials at every stage of the policy, this case simply does not fit within the closely guarded category of \"special needs.\" The fact that positive test results were turned over to the police does not merely provide a basis for distinguishing prior \"special needs\" cases. It also provides an affirmative reason for enforcing the Fourth Amendment's strictures. While state hospital employees, like other citizens, may have a duty to provide the police with evidence of criminal conduct that they inadvertently acquire in the course of routine treatment, when they undertake to obtain such evidence from their patients for the specific purpose of incriminating those patients, they have a special obligation to make sure that the patients are fully informed about their constitutional rights, as standards of knowing waiver require.

Pp. 9-18. 186 F.3d 469, reversed and remanded.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT~      Stevens, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which O'Connor, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined. Kennedy, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment. Scalia, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and Thomas, J., joined as to Part II.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      In this case, we must decide whether a state hospital's performance of a diagnostic test to obtain evidence of a patient's criminal conduct for law enforcement purposes is an unreasonable search if the patient has not consented to the procedure. More narrowly, the question is whether the interest in using the threat of criminal sanctions to deter pregnant women from using cocaine can justify a departure from the general rule that an official nonconsensual search is unconstitutional if not authorized by a valid warrant.~    ~    ~      2~      * In the fall of 1988, staff members at the public hospital operated in the city of Charleston by the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) became concerned about an apparent increase in the use of cocaine by patients who were receiving prenatal treatment.1 In response to this perceived increase, as of April 1989, MUSC began to order drug screens to be performed on urine samples from maternity patients who were suspected of using cocaine. If a patient tested positive, she was then referred by MUSC staff to the county substance abuse commission for counseling and treatment. However, despite the referrals, the incidence of cocaine use among the patients at MUSC did not appear to change.~    ~    ~      3~      Some four months later, Nurse Shirley Brown, the case manager for the MUSC obstetrics department, heard a news broadcast reporting that the police in Greenville, South Carolina, were arresting pregnant users of cocaine on the theory that such use harmed the fetus and was therefore child abuse.2 Nurse Brown discussed the story with MUSC's general counsel, Joseph C. Good, Jr., who then contacted Charleston Solicitor Charles Condon in order to offer MUSC's cooperation in prosecuting mothers whose children tested positive for drugs at birth.3~    ~    ~      4~      After receiving Good's letter, Solicitor Condon took the first steps in developing the policy at issue in this case. He organized the initial meetings, decided who would participate, and issued the invitations, in which he described his plan to prosecute women who tested positive for cocaine while pregnant. The task force that Condon formed included representatives of MUSC, the police, the County Substance Abuse Commission and the Department of Social Services. Their deliberations led to MUSC's adoption of a 12-page document entitled \"POLICY M-7,\" dealing with the subject of \"Management of Drug Abuse During Pregnancy.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. A-53.~    ~    ~      5~      The first three pages of Policy M-7 set forth the procedure to be followed by the hospital staff to \"identify/assist pregnant patients suspected of drug abuse.\" Id., at A-53 to A-56. The first section, entitled the \"Identification of Drug Abusers,\" provided that a patient should be tested for cocaine through a urine drug screen if she met one or more of nine criteria.4 It also stated that a chain of custody should be followed when obtaining and testing urine samples, presumably to make sure that the results could be used in subsequent criminal proceedings. The policy also provided for education and referral to a substance abuse clinic for patients who tested positive. Most important, it added the threat of law enforcement intervention that \"provided the necessary ' leverage' to make the [p]olicy effective.\" Brief for Respondents 8. That threat was, as respondents candidly acknowledge, essential to the program's success in getting women into treatment and keeping them there.~    ~    ~      6~      The threat of law enforcement involvement was set forth in two protocols, the first dealing with the identification of drug use during pregnancy, and the second with identification of drug use after labor. Under the latter protocol, the police were to be notified without delay and the patient promptly arrested. Under the former, after the initial positive drug test, the police were to be notified (and the patient arrested) only if the patient tested positive for cocaine a second time or if she missed an appointment with a substance abuse counselor.5 In 1990, however, the policy was modified at the behest of the solicitor's office to give the patient who tested positive during labor, like the patient who tested positive during a prenatal care visit, an opportunity to avoid arrest by consenting to substance abuse treatment.~    ~    ~      7~      The last six pages of the policy contained forms for the patients to sign, as well as procedures for the police to follow when a patient was arrested. The policy also prescribed in detail the precise offenses with which a woman could be charged, depending on the stage of her pregnancy. If the pregnancy was 27 weeks or less, the patient was to be charged with simple possession. If it was 28 weeks or more, she was to be charged with possession and distribution to a person under the age of 18-in this case, the fetus. If she delivered \"while testing positive for illegal drugs,\" she was also to be charged with unlawful neglect of a child. App. to Pet. for Cert. A-62. Under the policy, the police were instructed to interrogate the arrestee in order \"to ascertain the identity of the subject who provided illegal drugs to the suspect.\" Id., at A-63. Other than the provisions describing the substance abuse treatment to be offered to women who tested positive, the policy made no mention of any change in the prenatal care of such patients, nor did it prescribe any special treatment for the newborns.~    ~    II~    ~      8~      Petitioners are 10 women who received obstetrical care at MUSC and who were arrested after testing positive for cocaine. Four of them were arrested during the initial implementation of the policy; they were not offered the opportunity to receive drug treatment as an alternative to arrest. The others were arrested after the policy was modified in 1990; they either failed to comply with the terms of the drug treatment program or tested positive for a second time. Respondents include the city of Charleston, law enforcement officials who helped develop and enforce the policy, and representatives of MUSC.~    ~    ~      9~      Petitioners' complaint challenged the validity of the policy under various theories, including the claim that warrantless and nonconsensual drug tests conducted for criminal investigatory purposes were unconstitutional searches. Respondents advanced two principal defenses to the constitutional claim: (1) that, as a matter of fact, petitioners had consented to the searches; and (2) that, as a matter of law, the searches were reasonable, even absent consent, because they were justified by special non-law-enforcement purposes. The District Court rejected the second defense because the searches in question \"were not done by the medical university for independent purposes. [Instead,] the police came in and there was an agreement reached that the positive screens would be shared with the police.\" App. 1248-1249. Accordingly, the District Court submitted the factual defense to the jury with instructions that required a verdict in favor of petitioners unless the jury found consent.6 The jury found for respondents.~    ~    ~      10~      Petitioners appealed, arguing that the evidence was not sufficient to support the jury's consent finding. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, but without reaching the question of consent. 186 F.3d 469 (1999). Disagreeing with the District Court, the majority of the appellate panel held that the searches were reasonable as a matter of law under our line of cases recognizing that \"special needs\" may, in certain exceptional circumstances, justify a search policy designed to serve non-lawnbhyph;enforcement ends.7 On the understanding \"that MUSC personnel conducted the urine drug screens for medical purposes wholly independent of an intent to aid law enforcement efforts,\"8 id., at 477, the majority applied the balancing test used in Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U.S. 656 (1989), and Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646 (1995), and concluded that the interest in curtailing the pregnancy complications and medical costs associated with maternal cocaine use outweighed what the majority termed a minimal intrusion on the privacy of the patients. In dissent, Judge Blake concluded that the \"special needs\" doctrine should not apply and that the evidence of consent was insufficient to sustain the jury's verdict. 186 F.3d, at 487-488.~    ~    ~      11~      We granted certiorari, 528 U.S. 1187 (2000), to review the appellate court's holding on the \"special needs\" issue. Because we do not reach the question of the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to consent, we necessarily assume for purposes of our decision-as did the Court of Appeals-that the searches were conducted without the informed consent of the patients. We conclude that the judgment should be reversed and the case remanded for a decision on the consent issue.~    ~    III~    ~      12~      Because MUSC is a state hospital, the members of its staff are government actors, subject to the strictures of the Fourth Amendment. New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U.S. 325, 335-337 (1985). Moreover, the urine tests conducted by those staff members were indisputably searches within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn., 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989).9 Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals concluded that any of the nine criteria used to identify the women to be searched provided either probable cause to believe that they were using cocaine, or even the basis for a reasonable suspicion of such use. Rather, the District Court and the Court of Appeals viewed the case as one involving MUSC's right to conduct searches without warrants or probable cause.10 Furthermore, given the posture in which the case comes to us, we must assume for purposes of our decision that the tests were performed without the informed consent of the patients.11~    ~    ~      13~      Because the hospital seeks to justify its authority to conduct drug tests and to turn the results over to law enforcement agents without the knowledge or consent of the patients, this case differs from the four previous cases in which we have considered whether comparable drug tests \"fit within the closely guarded category of constitutionally permissible suspicionless searches.\" Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 309 (1997). In three of those cases, we sustained drug tests for railway employees involved in train accidents, Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn., 489 U.S. 602 (1989), for United States Customs Service employees seeking promotion to certain sensitive positions, Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U.S. 656 (1989), and for high school students participating in interscholastic sports, Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646 (1995). In the fourth case, we struck down such testing for candidates for designated state offices as unreasonable. Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305 (1997).~    ~    ~      14~      In each of those cases, we employed a balancing test that weighed the intrusion on the individual's interest in privacy against the \"special needs\" that supported the program. As an initial matter, we note that the invasion of privacy in this case is far more substantial than in those cases. In the previous four cases, there was no misunderstanding about the purpose of the test or the potential use of the test results, and there were protections against the dissemination of the results to third parties.12 The use of an adverse test result to disqualify one from eligibility for a particular benefit, such as a promotion or an opportunity to participate in an extracurricular activity, involves a less serious intrusion on privacy than the unauthorized dissemination of such results to third parties. The reasonable expectation of privacy enjoyed by the typical patient undergoing diagnostic tests in a hospital is that the results of those tests will not be shared with nonmedical personnel without her consent. See Brief for American Medical Association et al. as Amici Curiae 11; Brief for American Public Health Association et al. as Amici Curiae 6, 17-19.13 In none of our prior cases was there any intrusion upon that kind of expectation.14~    ~    ~      15~      The critical difference between those four drug-testing cases and this one, however, lies in the nature of the \"special need\" asserted as justification for the warrantless searches. In each of those earlier cases, the \"special need\" that was advanced as a justification for the absence of a warrant or individualized suspicion was one divorced from the State's general interest in law enforcement.15 This point was emphasized both in the majority opinions sustaining the programs in the first three cases,16 as well as in the dissent in the Chandler case.17 In this case, however, the central and indispensable feature of the policy from its inception was the use of law enforcement to coerce the patients into substance abuse treatment. This fact distinguishes this case from circumstances in which physicians or psychologists, in the course of ordinary medical procedures aimed at helping the patient herself, come across information that under rules of law or ethics is subject to reporting requirements, which no one has challenged here. See, e.g., Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, American Medical Association, PolicyFinder, Current Opinions E-5.05 (2000) (requiring reporting where \"a patient threatens to inflict serious bodily harm to another person or to him or herself and there is a reasonable probability that the patient may carry out the threat\"); Ark. Code Ann. 12-12-602 (1999) (requiring reporting of intentionally inflicted knife or gunshot wounds); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. 13-3620 (Supp. 2000) (requiring \"any . . . person having responsibility for the care or treatment of children\" to report suspected abuse or neglect to a peace officer or child protection agency).18~    ~    ~      16~      Respondents argue in essence that their ultimate purpose-namely, protecting the health of both mother and child-is a benificent one. In Chandler, however, we did not simply accept the State's invocation of a \"special need.\" Instead, we carried out a \"close review\" of the scheme at issue before concluding that the need in question was not \"special,\" as that term has been defined in our cases. 520 U.S., at 322. In this case, a review of the M-7 policy plainly reveals that the purpose actually served by the MUSC searches \"is ultimately indistinguishable from the general interest in crime control.\" Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. __, __ (2000) (slip op., at 15).~    ~    ~      17~      In looking to the programmatic purpose, we consider all the available evidence in order to determine the relevant primary purpose. See, e.g., id., at __-__ (slip op., at 12-14). In this case, as Judge Blake put it in her dissent below, \"it . . . is clear from the record that an initial and continuing focus of the policy was on the arrest and prosecution of drug-abusing mothers . . . .\" 186 F.3d, at 484. Tellingly, the document codifying the policy incorporates the police's operational guidelines. It devotes its attention to the chain of custody, the range of possible criminal charges, and the logistics of police notification and arrests. Nowhere, however, does the document discuss different courses of medical treatment for either mother or infant, aside from treatment for the mother's addiction.~    ~    ~      18~      Moreover, throughout the development and application of the policy, the Charleston prosecutors and police were extensively involved in the day-to-day administration of the policy. Police and prosecutors decided who would receive the reports of positive drug screens and what information would be included with those reports. App. 78-80, 145-146, 1058-1060. Law enforcement officials also helped determine the procedures to be followed when performing the screens.19 Id., at 1052-1053. See also id., at 26-27, 945. In the course of the policy's administration, they had access to Nurse Brown's medical files on the women who tested positive, routinely attended the substance abuse team's meetings, and regularly received copies of team documents discussing the women's progress. Id., at 122-124, 609-610. Police took pains to coordinate the timing and circumstances of the arrests with MUSC staff, and, in particular, Nurse Brown. Id., at 1057-1058.~    ~    ~      19~      While the ultimate goal of the program may well have been to get the women in question into substance abuse treatment and off of drugs, the immediate objective of the searches was to generate evidence for law enforcement purposes20 in order to reach that goal.21 The threat of law enforcement may ultimately have been intended as a means to an end, but the direct and primary purpose of MUSC's policy was to ensure the use of those means. In our opinion, this distinction is critical. Because law enforcement involvement always serves some broader social purpose or objective, under respondents' view, virtually any nonconsensual suspicionless search could be immunized under the special needs doctrine by defining the search solely in terms of its ultimate, rather than immediate, purpose.22 Such an approach is inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment. Given the primary purpose of the Charleston program, which was to use the threat of arrest and prosecution in order to force women into treatment, and given the extensive involvement of law enforcement officials at every stage of the policy, this case simply does not fit within the closely guarded category of \"special needs.\"23~    ~    ~      20~      The fact that positive test results were turned over to the police does not merely provide a basis for distinguishing our prior cases applying the \"special needs\" balancing approach to the determination of drug use. It also provides an affirmative reason for enforcing the strictures of the Fourth Amendment. While state hospital employees, like other citizens, may have a duty to provide the police with evidence of criminal conduct that they inadvertently acquire in the course of routine treatment, when they undertake to obtain such evidence from their patients for the specific purpose of incriminating those patients, they have a special obligation to make sure that the patients are fully informed about their constitutional rights, as standards of knowing waiver require.24 Cf. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).~    ~    ~      21~      As respondents have repeatedly insisted, their motive was benign rather than punitive. Such a motive, however, cannot justify a departure from Fourth Amendment protections, given the pervasive involvement of law enforcement with the development and application of the MUSC policy. The stark and unique fact that characterizes this case is that Policy M-7 was designed to obtain evidence of criminal conduct by the tested patients that would be turned over to the police and that could be admissible in subsequent criminal prosecutions. While respondents are correct that drug abuse both was and is a serious problem, \"the gravity of the threat alone cannot be dispositive of questions concerning what means law enforcement officers may employ to pursue a given purpose.\" Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S., at __-___ (slip op., at 9-10). The Fourth Amendment's general prohibition against nonconsensual, warrantless, and suspicionless searches necessarily applies to such a policy. See, e.g., Chandler, 520 U.S., at 308; Skinner 498 U.S., at 619.~    ~    ~      22~      Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      23~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         As several witnesses testified at trial, the problem of \"crack babies\" was widely perceived in the late 1980's as a national epidemic, prompting considerable concern both in the medical community and among the general populace.~      ~      ~        2~         Under South Carolina law, a viable fetus has historically been regarded as a person; in 1995, the South Carolina Supreme Court held that the ingestion of cocaine during the third trimester of pregnancy constitutes criminal child neglect. Whitner v. South Carolina, 328 S. C. 1, 492 S. E. 2d 777 (1995), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1145 (1998).~      ~      ~        3~         In his letter dated August 23, 1989, Good wrote: \" Please advise us if your office is anticipating future criminal action and what if anything our Medical Center needs to do to assist you in this matter.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. A-67.4 Those criteria were as follows: \"1. No prenatal care \"2. Late prenatal care after 24 weeks gestation \"3. Incomplete prenatal care \"4. Abruptio placentae \"5. Intrauterine fetal death \"6. Preterm labor ' of no obvious cause' \"7. IUGR [intrauterine growth retardation] ' of no obvious cause' \"8.  Previously known drug or alcohol abuse \"9. Unexplained congenital anomalies.\" Id., at A-53 to A-54.~      ~      ~        5~         Despite the conditional description of the first category, when the policy was in its initial stages, a positive test was immediately reported to the police, who then promptly arrested the patient.~      ~      ~        6~         The instructions read: \"THERE WERE NO SEARCH WARRANTS ISSUED BY A MAGISTRATE OR ANY OTHER PROPER JUDICIAL OFFICER TO PERMIT THESE URINE SCREENS TO BE TAKEN. THERE NOT BEING A WARRANT ISSUED, THEY ARE UNREASONABLE AND IN VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES, UNLESS THE DEFENDANTS HAVE SHOWN BY THE GREATER WEIGHT OR PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE THAT THE PLAINTIFFS CONSENTED TO THOSE SEARCHES.\" App. 1314-1315. Under the judge's instructions, in order to find that the plaintiffs had consented to the searches, it was necessary for the jury to find that they had consented to the taking of the samples, to the testing for evidence of cocaine, and to the possible disclosure of the test results to the police. Respondents have not argued, as Justice Scalia does, that it is permissible for members of the staff of a public hospital to use diagnostic tests \"deceivingly\" to obtain incriminating evidence from their patients. See post, at 3 (dissenting opinion).~      ~      ~        7~         The term \"special needs\" first appeared in Justice Blackmun's opinion concurring in the judgment in New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U.S. 325, 351 (1985). In his concurrence, Justice Blackmun agreed with the Court that there are limited exceptions to the probable-cause requirement, in which reasonableness is determined by \"a careful balancing of governmental and private interests,\" but concluded that such a test should only be applied \"in those exceptional circumstances in which special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement, make the warrant and probable-cause requirement impracticable . . . .\" Ibid. This Court subsequently adopted the \"special needs\" terminology in O'Connor v. Ortega, 480 U.S. 709, 720 (1987) (plurality opinion), and Griffin v. Wisconsin, 483 U.S. 868, 873 (1987), concluding that, in limited circumstances, a search unsupported by either warrant or probable cause can be constitutional when \"special needs\" other than the normal need for law enforcement provide sufficient justification. See also Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652-653 (1995).~      ~      ~        8~         The majority stated that the District Court had made such a finding. 186 F.3d 469, 477 (CA4 1999). The text of the relevant finding, made in the context of petitioners' now abandoned Title VI claim, reads as follows: \"The policy was applied in all maternity departments at MUSC. Its goal was not to arrest patients but to facilitate their treatment and protect both the mother and unborn child.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. A-38. That finding, however, must be read in light of this comment by the District Court with respect to the Fourth Amendment claim:   \". . . THESE SEARCHES WERE NOT DONE BY THE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY FOR INDEPENDENT PURPOSES. IF THEY HAD BEEN, THEN THEY WOULD NOT IMPLICATE THE FOURTH AMENDMENT. OBVIOUSLY AS I POINT OUT THERE ON PAGE 4, NORMALLY URINE SCREENS AND BLOOD TESTS AND THAT TYPE OF THING CAN BE TAKEN BY HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT THE FOURTH AMENDMENT. THE ONLY REASON THE FOURTH AMENDMENT IS IMPLICATED HERE IS THAT THE POLICE CAME IN AND THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT REACHED THAT THE POSITIVE SCREENS WOULD BE SHARED WITH THE POLICE. AND THEN THE SCREEN IS NOT DONE INDEPENDENT OF POLICE, IT'S DONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE POLICE AND THAT IMPLICATES THE FOURTH AMENDMENT.\" App. 1247-1249.~      ~      ~        9~          In arguing that the urine tests at issue were not searches, the dissent attempts to disaggregate the taking and testing of the urine sample from the reporting of the results to the police. See post, at 2. However, in our special needs cases, we have routinely treated urine screens taken by state agents as searches within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment even though the results were not reported to the police, see, e.g., Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305 (1997); Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646 (1995); Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn., 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989); Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U.S. 656 (1989), and respondents here do not contend that the tests were not searches. Rather, they argue that the searches were justified by consent and/or by special needs.~      ~      ~        10~         In a footnote to their brief, respondents do argue that the searches were not entirely suspicionless. Brief for Respondents 23, n. 13. They do not, however, point to any evidence in the record indicating that any of the nine search criteria was more apt to be caused by cocaine use than by some other factor, such as malnutrition, illness, or indigency. More significantly, their legal argument and the reasoning of the majority panel opinion rest on the premise that the policy would be valid even if the tests were conducted randomly.~      ~      ~        11~         The dissent would have us do otherwise and resolve the issue of consent in favor of respondents. Because the Court of Appeals did not discuss this issue, we think it more prudent to allow that court to resolve the legal and factual issues in the first instance, and we express no view on those issues. See, e.g., Glover v. United States, 531 U.S. ___ (2001); National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Smith, 525 U.S. 459, 470 (1999).~      ~      ~        12~         Chandler, 520 U.S., at 312, 318; Acton, 515 U.S., at 658; Skinner, 489 U.S., at 621, n. 5, 622, n. 6; Von Raab, 489 U.S., at 663, 666-667, 672, n. 2.~      ~      ~        13~         There are some circumstances in which state hospital employees, like other citizens, may have a duty to provide law enforcement officials with evidence of criminal conduct acquired in the course of routine treatment, see, e.g., S. C. Code Ann. 20-7-510 (2000) (physicians and nurses required to report to child welfare agency or law enforcement authority \"when in the person's professional capacity the person\" receives information that a child has been abused or neglected). While the existence of such laws might lead a patient to expect that members of the hospital staff might turn over evidence acquired in the course of treatment to which the patient had consented, they surely would not lead a patient to anticipate that hospital staff would intentionally set out to obtain incriminating evidence from their patients for law enforcement purposes.~      ~      ~        14~         In fact, we have previously recognized that an intrusion on that expectation may have adverse consequences because it may deter patients from receiving needed medical care. Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 599-600 (1977). Cf. Poland, Dombrowski, Ager,  Sokol, Punishing pregnant drug users: enhancing the flight from care, 31 Drug and Alcohol Dependence 199-203 (1993).~      ~      ~        15~         As the Chief Justice recently noted: \"The ' special needs' doctrine, which has been used to uphold certain suspicionless searches performed for reasons unrelated to law enforcement, is an exception to the general rule that a search must be based on individualized suspicion of wrongdoing.\" Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. __, ___ (2000) (slip op., at 7) (dissenting opinion); see also nn. 16-17, infra. In T. L. O., we made a point of distinguishing searches \"carried out by school authorities acting alone and on their own authority\" from those conducted \"in conjunction with or at the behest of law enforcement agencies.\" 469 U.S., at 341, n. 7.   The dissent, however, relying on Griffin v. Wisconsin, 483 U.S. 868 (1987), argues that the special needs doctrine \"is ordinarily employed, precisely to enable searches by law enforcement officials who, of course, ordinarily have a law enforcement objective.\" Post, at 7. Viewed in the context of our special needs case law and even viewed in isolation, Griffin does not support the proposition for which the dissent invokes it. In other special needs cases, we have tolerated suspension of the Fourth Amendment's warrant or probable cause requirement in part because there was no law enforcement purpose behind the searches in those cases, and there was little, if any, entanglement with law enforcement. See Skinner, 489 U.S., at 620-621; Von Raab, 489 U.S., at 665-666; Acton, 515 U.S., at 658. Moreover, after our decision in Griffin, we reserved the question whether \"routine use in criminal prosecutions of evidence obtained pursuant to the administrative scheme would give rise to an inference of pretext, or otherwise impugn the administrative nature of the . . . program.\" Skinner, 489 U.S., at 621, n. 5. In Griffin itself, this Court noted that \"[a]lthough a probation officer is not an impartial magistrate, neither is he the police officer who normally conducts searches against the ordinary citizen.\" 483 U.S., at 876. Finally, we agree with petitioners that Griffin is properly read as limited by the fact that probationers have a lesser expectation of privacy than the public at large. Id., at 874-875.~      ~      ~        16~         In Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn., 489 U.S. 602 (1989), this Court noted that \"[t]he FRA has prescribed toxicological tests, not to assist in the prosecution of employees, but rather 'to prevent accidents and casualties in railroad operations that result from impairment of employees by alcohol or drugs.' \" Id., at 620-621 (quoting 49 CFR  219.1(a) (1987)). Similarly, in Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U.S. 656 (1989), we concluded that it was \"clear that the Customs Service's drug-testing program is not designed to serve the ordinary needs of law enforcement. Test results may not be used in a criminal prosecution of the employee without the employee's consent.\" Id., at 665-666. In the same vein, in Acton, 515 U.S., at 658, we relied in part on the fact that \"the results of the tests are disclosed only to a limited class of school personnel who have a need to know; and they are not turned over to law enforcement authorities or used for any internal disciplinary function\" in finding the searches reasonable.~      ~      ~        17~         \"Today's opinion speaks of a 'closely guarded' class of permissible suspicionless searches which must be justified by a 'special need.' But this term, as used in Skinner and Von Raab and on which the Court now relies, was used in a quite different sense than it is used by the Court today. In Skinner and Von Raab it was used to describe a basis for a search apart from the regular needs of law enforcement, Skinner, [489 U.S.], at 620; Von Raab, [489 U.S.], at 669. The 'special needs' inquiry as delineated there has not required especially great 'importan[ce],' [520 U.S.], at 318, unless one considers 'the supervision of probationers,' or the 'operation of a government office,' Skinner, supra, at 620, to be especially 'important.' Under our precedents, if there was a proper governmental purpose other than law enforcement, there was a 'special need,' and the Fourth Amendment then required the familiar balancing between that interest and the individual's privacy interest.\" Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S., at 325 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting).~      ~      ~        18~         Our emphasis on this distinction should make it clear that, contrary to the hyperbole in the dissent, we do not view these reporting requirements as \"clearly bad.\" See post, at 5, n. 3. Those requirements are simply not in issue here.~      ~      ~        19~         Accordingly, the police organized a meeting with the staff of the police and hospital laboratory staffs, as well as Nurse Brown, in which the police went over the concept of a chain of custody system with the MUSC staff. App. 1052-1053.~      ~      ~        20~         We italicize those words lest our reasoning be misunderstood. See post, at 1-2 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment). In none of our previous special needs cases have we upheld the collection of evidence for criminal law enforcement purposes. Our essential point is the same as Justice Kennedy's-the extensive entanglement of law enforcement cannot be justified by reference to legitimate needs.   According to the dissent, the fact that MUSC performed tests prior to the development of Policy M-7 should immunize any subsequent testing policy despite the presence of a law enforcement purpose and extensive law enforcement involvement. See post, at 8-10. To say that any therapeutic purpose did not disappear is simply to miss the point. What matters is that under the new policy developed by the solicitor's office and MUSC, law enforcement involvement was the means by which that therapeutic purpose was to be met. Policy M-7 was, at its core, predicated on the use of law enforcement. The extensive involvement of law enforcement and the threat of prosecution were, as respondents admitted, essential to the program's success.~      ~      ~        21~         Accordingly, this case differs from New York v. Burger, 482 U.S. 691 (1987), in which the Court upheld a scheme in which police officers were used to carry out administrative inspections of vehicle dismantling businesses. That case involved an industry in which the expectation of privacy in commercial premises was \"particularly attenuated\" given the extent to which the industry in question was closely regulated. Id., at 700. More important for our purposes, the Court relied on the \"plain administrative purposes\" of the scheme to reject the contention that the statute was in fact \"designed to gather evidence to enable convictions under the penal laws . . . .\" Id., at 715. The discovery of evidence of other violations would have been merely incidental to the purposes of the administrative search. In contrast, in this case, the policy was specifically designed to gather evidence of violations of penal laws.   This case also differs from the handful of seizure cases in which we have applied a balancing test to determine Fourth Amendment reasonableness. See, e.g., Michigan Dept. of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U.S. 444, 455 (1990); United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543 (1976). First, those cases involved roadblock seizures, rather than \"the intrusive search of the body or the home.\" See Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S., at __-___ (slip op., at 7-8) (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting); Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S., at 561 (\"[W]e deal neither with searches nor with the sanctity of private dwellings, ordinarily afforded the most stringent Fourth Amendment protection\"). Second, the Court explicitly distinguished the cases dealing with checkpoints from those dealing with \"special needs.\" Sitz, 496 U.S., at 450.~      ~      ~        22~         Thus, under respondents' approach, any search to generate evidence for use by the police in enforcing general criminal laws would be justified by reference to the broad social benefits that those laws might bring about (or, put another way, the social harms that they might prevent).~      ~      ~        23~         It is especially difficult to argue that the program here was designed simply to save lives. Amici claim a near consensus in the medical community that programs of the sort at issue, by discouraging women who use drugs from seeking prenatal care, harm, rather than advance, the cause of prenatal health. See Brief for American Medical Association as Amicus Curiae 6-22; Brief for American Public Health Association et al. as Amici Curiae 17-21; Brief for NARAL Foundation et al. as Amici Curiae 18-19.~      ~      ~        24~         In fact, some MUSC staff made this distinction themselves. See Pl. Exh. No. 14, Hulsey, 11-17-89, Coke Committee, 1-2 (\"The use of medically indicated tests for substance abuse, obtained in conventional manners, must be distinguished from mandatory screening and collection of evidence using such methods as chain of custody, etc. . . . The question is raised as to whether pediatricians should function as law enforcement officials. While the reporting of criminal activity to appropriate authorities may be required and/or ethically just, the active pursuit of evidence to be used against individuals presenting for medical care may not be proper\").   The dissent, however, mischaracterizes our opinion as holding that \"material which a person voluntarily entrusts to someone else cannot be given by that person to the police and used for whatever evidence it may contain.\" Post, at 4. But, as we have noted elsewhere, given the posture of the case, we must assume for purposes of decision that the patients did not consent to the searches, and we leave the question of consent for the Court of Appeals to determine. See n. 11, supra.   The dissent further argues that our holding \"leaves law enforcement officials entirely in the dark as to when they can use incriminating evidence obtained from 'trusted' sources.\" See post, at 5. With all due respect, we disagree. We do not address a case in which doctors independently complied with reporting requirements. Rather, as we point out above, in this case, medical personnel used the criteria set out in n. 4, supra, to collect evidence for law enforcement purposes, and law enforcement officers were extensively involved in the initiation, design, and implementation of the program. In such circumstances, the Fourth Amendment's general prohibition against nonconsensual, warrantless, and suspicionless searches applies in the absence of consent. We decline to accept the dissent's invitation to make a foray into dicta and address other situations not before us.~      ~    ~    Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment~    ~      24~      Justice Kennedy, concurring in the judgment.~    ~    ~      25~      I agree that the search procedure in issue cannot be sustained under the Fourth Amendment. My reasons for this conclusion differ somewhat from those set forth by the Court, however, leading to this separate opinion.~    ~    ~      26~      * The Court does not dispute that the search policy at some level serves special needs, beyond those of ordinary law enforcement, such as the need to protect the health of mother and child when a pregnant mother uses cocaine. Instead, the majority characterizes these special needs as the \"ultimate goal[s]\" of the policy, as distinguished from the policy's \"immediate purpose,\" the collection of evidence of drug use, which, the Court reasons, is the appropriate inquiry for the special needs analysis. Ante, at 14-16.~    ~    ~      27~      The majority views its distinction between the ultimate goal and immediate purpose of the policy as critical to its analysis. Ante, at 16. The distinction the Court makes, however, lacks foundation in our special needs cases. All of our special needs cases have turned upon what the majority terms the policy's ultimate goal. For example, in Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn., 489 U.S. 602 (1989), had we employed the majority's distinction, we would have identified as the relevant need the collection of evidence of drug and alcohol use by railway employees. Instead, we identified the relevant need as \"[t]he Government's interest in regulating the conduct of railroad employees to ensure [railroad] safety.\" Id., at 620. In Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U.S. 656 (1989), the majority's distinction should have compelled us to isolate the relevant need as the gathering of evidence of drug abuse by would-be drug interdiction officers. Instead, the special needs the Court identified were the necessities \"to deter drug use among those eligible for promotion to sensitive positions within the [United States Customs] Service and to prevent the promotion of drug users to those positions.\" Id., at 666. In Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646 (1995), the majority's distinction would have required us to identify the immediate purpose of gathering evidence of drug use by student-athletes as the relevant \"need\" for purposes of the special needs analysis. Instead, we sustained the policy as furthering what today's majority would have termed the policy's ultimate goal: \"[d]eterring drug use by our Nation's schoolchildren,\" and particularly by student-athletes, because \"the risk of immediate physical harm to the drug user or those with whom he is playing his sport is particularly high.\" Id., at 661-662.~    ~    ~      28~      It is unsurprising that in our prior cases we have concentrated on what the majority terms a policy's ultimate goal, rather than its proximate purpose. By very definition, in almost every case the immediate purpose of a search policy will be to obtain evidence. The circumstance that a particular search, like all searches, is designed to collect evidence of some sort reveals nothing about the need it serves. Put a different way, although procuring evidence is the immediate result of a successful search, until today that procurement has not been identified as the special need which justifies the search.~    ~    II~    ~      29~      While the majority's reasoning seems incorrect in the respects just discussed, I agree with the Court that the search policy cannot be sustained. As the majority demonstrates and well explains, there was substantial law enforcement involvement in the policy from its inception. None of our special needs precedents has sanctioned the routine inclusion of law enforcement, both in the design of the policy and in using arrests, either threatened or real, to implement the system designed for the special needs objectives. The special needs cases we have decided do not sustain the active use of law enforcement, including arrest and prosecutions, as an integral part of a program which seeks to achieve legitimate, civil objectives. The traditional warrant and probable-cause requirements are waived in our previous cases on the explicit assumption that the evidence obtained in the search is not intended to be used for law enforcement purposes. Most of those tested for drug use under the policy at issue here were not brought into direct contact with law enforcement. This does not change the fact, however, that, as a systemic matter, law enforcement was a part of the implementation of the search policy in each of its applications. Every individual who tested positive was given a letter explaining the policy not from the hospital but from the solicitor's office. Everyone who tested positive was told a second positive test or failure to undergo substance abuse treatment would result in arrest and prosecution. As the Court holds, the hospital acted, in some respects, as an institutional arm of law enforcement for purposes of the policy. Under these circumstances, while the policy may well have served legitimate needs unrelated to law enforcement, it had as well a penal character with a far greater connection to law enforcement than other searches sustained under our special needs rationale.~    ~    ~      30~      In my view, it is necessary and prudent to be explicit in explaining the limitations of today's decision. The beginning point ought to be to acknowledge the legitimacy of the State's interest in fetal life and of the grave risk to the life and health of the fetus, and later the child, caused by cocaine ingestion. Infants whose mothers abuse cocaine during pregnancy are born with a wide variety of physical and neurological abnormalities. See Chiriboga, Brust, Bateman,  Hauser, Dose-Response Effect of Fetal Cocaine Exposure on Newborn Neurologic Function, 103 Pediatrics 79 (1999) (finding that, compared with unexposed infants, cocaine-exposed infants experienced higher rates of intrauterine growth retardation, smaller head circumference, global hypertonia, coarse tremor, and extensor leg posture). Prenatal exposure to cocaine can also result in developmental problems which persist long after birth. See Arendt, Angelopoulos, Salvator,  Singer, Motor Development of Cocaine-exposed Children at Age Two Years, 103 Pediatrics 86 (1999) (concluding that, at two years of age, children who were exposed to cocaine in utero exhibited significantly less fine and gross motor development than those not so exposed); Chasnoff et al., Prenatal Exposure to Cocaine and Other Drugs: Outcome at Four to Six Years, 846 Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 314, 319-320 (J. Harvey and B. Kosofsky eds. 1998) (finding that four to six year olds who were exposed to cocaine in utero exhibit higher instances of depression, anxiety, social, thought, and attention problems, and delinquent and aggressive behaviors than their unexposed counterparts). There can be no doubt that a mother's ingesting this drug can cause tragic injury to a fetus and a child. There should be no doubt that South Carolina can impose punishment upon an expectant mother who has so little regard for her own unborn that she risks causing him or her lifelong damage and suffering. The State, by taking special measures to give rehabilitation and training to expectant mothers with this tragic addiction or weakness, acts well within its powers and its civic obligations.~    ~    ~      31~      The holding of the Court, furthermore, does not call into question the validity of mandatory reporting laws such as child abuse laws which require teachers to report evidence of child abuse to the proper authorities, even if arrest and prosecution is the likely result. That in turn highlights the real difficulty. As this case comes to us, and as reputable sources confirm, see K. Farkas, Training Health Care and Human Services Personnel in Perinatal Substance Abuse, in Drug  Alcohol Abuse Reviews, Substance Abuse During Pregnancy and Childhood, 13, 27-28 (R. Watson ed. 1995); U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Pregnant, Substance-Using Women 48 (1993), we must accept the premise that the medical profession can adopt acceptable criteria for testing expectant mothers for cocaine use in order to provide prompt and effective counseling to the mother and to take proper medical steps to protect the child. If prosecuting authorities then adopt legitimate procedures to discover this information and prosecution follows, that ought not to invalidate the testing. One of the ironies of the case, then, may be that the program now under review, which gives the cocaine user a second and third chance, might be replaced by some more rigorous system. We must, however, take the case as it comes to us; and the use of handcuffs, arrests, prosecutions, and police assistance in designing and implementing the testing and rehabilitation policy cannot be sustained under our previous cases concerning mandatory testing.~    ~    III~    ~      32~      An essential, distinguishing feature of the special needs cases is that the person searched has consented, though the usual voluntariness analysis is altered because adverse consequences, (e.g., dismissal from employment or disqualification from playing on a high school sports team), will follow from refusal. The person searched has given consent, as defined to take into account that the consent was not voluntary in the full sense of the word. See Skinner, 489 U.S., at 615; Von Raab, 489 U.S., at 660-661; Acton, 515 U.S., at 650-651. The consent, and the circumstances in which it was given, bear upon the reasonableness of the whole special needs program.~    ~    ~      33~      Here, on the other hand, the question of consent, even with the special connotation used in the special needs cases, has yet to be decided. Indeed, the Court finds it necessary to take the unreal step of assuming there was no voluntary consent at all. Thus, we have erected a strange world for deciding the case.~    ~    ~      34~      My discussion has endeavored to address the permissibility of a law enforcement purpose in this artificial context. The role played by consent might have affected our assessment of the issues. My concurrence in the judgment, furthermore, should not be interpreted as having considered or resolved the important questions raised by Justice Scalia with reference to whether limits might be imposed on the use of the evidence if in fact it were obtained with the patient's consent and in the context of the special needs program. Had we the prerogative to discuss the role played by consent, the case might have been quite a different one. All are in agreement, of course, that the Court of Appeals will address these issues in further proceedings on remand.~    ~    ~      35~      With these remarks, I concur in the judgment.       Scalia, J., dissenting~    ~    ~      36~      Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Thomas join as to Part II, dissenting.~    ~    ~      37~      There is always an unappealing aspect to the use of doctors and nurses, ministers of mercy, to obtain incriminating evidence against the supposed objects of their ministration-although here, it is correctly pointed out, the doctors and nurses were ministering not just to the mothers but also to the children whom their cooperation with the police was meant to protect. But whatever may be the correct social judgment concerning the desirability of what occurred here, that is not the issue in the present case. The Constitution does not resolve all difficult social questions, but leaves the vast majority of them to resolution by debate and the democratic process-which would produce a decision by the citizens of Charleston, through their elected representatives, to forbid or permit the police action at issue here. The question before us is a narrower one: whether, whatever the desirability of this police conduct, it violates the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures. In my view, it plainly does not.~    ~    ~      38~      * The first step in Fourth Amendment analysis is to identify the search or seizure at issue. What petitioners, the Court, and to a lesser extent the concurrence really object to is not the urine testing, but the hospital's reporting of positive drug-test results to police. But the latter is obviously not a search. At most it may be a \"derivative use of the product of a past unlawful search,\" which, of course, \"work[s] no new Fourth Amendment wrong\" and \"presents a question, not of rights, but of remedies.\" United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 354 (1974). There is only one act that could conceivably be regarded as a search of petitioners in the present case: the taking of the urine sample. I suppose the testing of that urine for traces of unlawful drugs could be considered a search of sorts, but the Fourth Amendment protects only against searches of citizens' \"persons, houses, papers, and effects\"; and it is entirely unrealistic to regard urine as one of the \"effects\" (i.e., part of the property) of the person who has passed and abandoned it. Cf. California v. Greenwood, 486 U.S. 35 (1988) (garbage left at curb is not property protected by the Fourth Amendment). Some would argue, I suppose, that testing of the urine is prohibited by some generalized privacy right \"emanating\" from the \"penumbras\" of the Constitution (a question that is not before us); but it is not even arguable that the testing of urine that has been lawfully obtained is a Fourth Amendment search. (I may add that, even if it were, the factors legitimizing the taking of the sample, which I discuss below, would likewise legitimize the testing of it.)~    ~    ~      39~      It is rudimentary Fourth Amendment law that a search which has been consented to is not unreasonable. There is no contention in the present case that the urine samples were extracted forcibly. The only conceivable bases for saying that they were obtained without consent are the contentions (1) that the consent was coerced by the patients' need for medical treatment, (2) that the consent was uninformed because the patients were not told that the tests would include testing for drugs, and (3) that the consent was uninformed because the patients were not told that the results of the tests would be provided to the police.1 (When the court below said that it was reserving the factual issue of consent, see 186 F.3d 469, 476 (CA4 1999), it was referring at most to these three-and perhaps just to the last two.)~    ~    ~      40~      Under our established Fourth Amendment law, the last two contentions would not suffice, even without reference to the special-needs doctrine. The Court's analogizing of this case to Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), and its claim that \"standards of knowing waiver\" apply, ante, at 17, are flatly contradicted by our jurisprudence, which shows that using lawfully (but deceivingly) obtained material for purposes other than those represented, and giving that material or information derived from it to the police, is not unconstitutional. In Hoffa v. United States, 385 U.S. 293 (1966), \"[t]he argument [was] that [the informant's] failure to disclose his role as a government informant vitiated the consent that the petitioner gave\" for the agent's access to evidence of criminal wrongdoing, id., at 300. We rejected that argument, because \"the Fourth Amendment [does not protect] a wrongdoer's misplaced belief that a person to whom he voluntarily confides his wrongdoing will not reveal it.\" Id., at 302. Because the defendant had voluntarily provided access to the evidence, there was no reasonable expectation of privacy to invade. Abuse of trust is surely a sneaky and ungentlemanly thing, and perhaps there should be (as there are) laws against such conduct by the government. See, e.g., 50 U.S.C.  403-7 (1994 ed., Supp. IV) (prohibiting the \"Intelligence Community['s]\" use of journalists as agents). That, however, is immaterial for Fourth Amendment purposes, for \"however strongly a defendant may trust an apparent colleague, his expectations in this respect are not protected by the Fourth Amendment when it turns out that the colleague is a government agent regularly communicating with the authorities.\" United States v. White, 401 U.S. 745, 749 (1971) (emphasis added). The Hoffa line of cases, I may note, does not distinguish between operations meant to catch a criminal in the act, and those meant only to gather evidence of prior wrongdoing. See, e.g., United States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435, 440-443 (1976); cf. Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U.S. 292, 298 (1990) (relying on Hoffa in holding the Miranda rule did not require suppression of an inmate confession given an agent posing as a fellow prisoner).~    ~    ~      41~      Until today, we have never held-or even suggested- that material which a person voluntarily entrusts to someone else cannot be given by that person to the police, and used for whatever evidence it may contain.2 Without so much as discussing the point, the Court today opens a hole in our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, the size and shape of which is entirely indeterminate. Today's holding would be remarkable enough if the confidential relationship violated by the police conduct were at least one protected by state law. It would be surprising to learn, for example, that in a State which recognizes a spousal evidentiary privilege the police cannot use evidence obtained from a cooperating husband or wife. But today's holding goes even beyond that, since there does not exist any physician-patient privilege in South Carolina. See, e.g., Peagler v. Atlantic Coast R. R. Co., 232 S. C. 274, 101 S. E. 2d 821 (1958). Since the Court declines even to discuss the issue, it leaves law enforcement officials entirely in the dark as to when they can use incriminating evidence obtained from \"trusted\" sources.3 Presumably the lines will be drawn in the case-by-case development of a whole new branch of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, taking yet another social judgment (which confidential relationships ought not be invaded by the police) out of democratic control, and confiding it to the uncontrolled judgment of this Court-uncontrolled because there is no common-law precedent to guide it. I would adhere to our established law, which says that information obtained through violation of a relationship of trust is obtained consensually, and is hence not a search.4~    ~    ~      42~      There remains to be considered the first possible basis for invalidating this search, which is that the patients were coerced to produce their urine samples by their necessitous circumstances, to-wit, their need for medical treatment of their pregnancy. If that was coercion, it was not coercion applied by the government-and if such nongovernmental coercion sufficed, the police would never be permitted to use the ballistic evidence obtained from treatment of a patient with a bullet wound. And the Fourth Amendment would invalidate those many state laws that require physicians to report gunshot wounds,5 evidence of spousal abuse,6 and (like the South Carolina law relevant here, see S. C. Code Ann. 20-7-510 (2000)) evidence of child abuse.7~    ~    II~    ~      43~      I think it clear, therefore, that there is no basis for saying that obtaining of the urine sample was unconstitutional. The special-needs doctrine is thus quite irrelevant, since it operates only to validate searches and seizures that are otherwise unlawful. In the ensuing discussion, however, I shall assume (contrary to legal precedent) that the taking of the urine sample was (either because of the patients' necessitous circumstances, or because of failure to disclose that the urine would be tested for drugs, or because of failure to disclose that the results of the test would be given to the police) coerced. Indeed, I shall even assume (contrary to common sense) that the testing of the urine constituted an unconsented search of the patients' effects. On those assumptions, the special-needs doctrine would become relevant; and, properly applied, would validate what was done here.~    ~    ~      44~      The conclusion of the Court that the special-needs doctrine is inapplicable rests upon its contention that respondents \"undert[ook] to obtain [drug] evidence from their patients\" not for any medical purpose, but \"for the specific purpose of incriminating those patients.\" Ante, at 17 (emphasis in original). In other words, the purported medical rationale was merely a pretext; there was no special need. See Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn., 489 U.S. 602, 621, n. 5 (1989). This contention contradicts the District Court's finding of fact that the goal of the testing policy \"was not to arrest patients but to facilitate their treatment and protect both the mother and unborn child.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. A-38.8 This finding is binding upon us unless clearly erroneous, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a). Not only do I find it supportable; I think any other finding would have to be overturned.~    ~    ~      45~      The cocaine tests started in April 1989, neither at police suggestion nor with police involvement. Expectant mothers who tested positive were referred by hospital staff for substance-abuse treatment, ante, at 2 (opinion of the Court)-an obvious health benefit to both mother and child. See App. 43 (testimony that a single use of cocaine can cause fetal damage). And, since \"[i]nfants whose mothers abuse cocaine during pregnancy are born with a wide variety of physical and neurological abnormalities,\" ante, at 4 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment), which require medical attention, see Brief in Opposition A76-A77, the tests were of additional medical benefit in predicting needed postnatal treatment for the child. Thus, in their origin-before the police were in any way involved-the tests had an immediate, not merely an \"ultimate,\" ante, at 14 (opinion of the Court), purpose of improving maternal and infant health. Several months after the testing had been initiated, a nurse discovered that local police were arresting pregnant users of cocaine for child abuse, the hospital's general counsel wrote the county solicitor to ask \"what, if anything, our Medical Center needs to do to assist you in this matter,\" App. 499 (South Carolina law requires child abuse to be reported, see S. C. Code Ann. 20-7-510), the police suggested ways to avoid tainting evidence, and the hospital and police in conjunction used the testing program as a means of securing what the Court calls the \"ultimate\" health benefit of coercing drug-abusing mothers into drug treatment. See ante, at 2-4, 14. Why would there be any reason to believe that, once this policy of using the drug tests for their \"ultimate\" health benefits had been adopted, use of them for their original, immediate, benefits somehow disappeared, and testing somehow became in its entirety nothing more than a \"pretext\" for obtaining grounds for arrest? On the face of it, this is incredible. The only evidence of the exclusively arrest-related purpose of the testing adduced by the Court is that the police-cooperation policy itself does not describe how to care for cocaine-exposed infants. See ante, at 4, 14. But of course it does not, since that policy, adopted months after the cocaine testing was initiated, had as its only health object the \"ultimate\" goal of inducing drug treatment through threat of arrest. Does the Court really believe (or even hope) that, once invalidation of the program challenged here has been decreed, drug testing will cease?~    ~    ~      46~      In sum, there can be no basis for the Court's purported ability to \"distinguis[h] this case from circumstances in which physicians or psychologists, in the course of ordinary medical procedures aimed at helping the patient herself, come across information that . . . is subject to reporting requirements,\" ante, at 12-13, unless it is this: That the addition of a law-enforcement-related purpose to a legitimate medical purpose destroys applicability of the \"special-needs\" doctrine. But that is quite impossible, since the special-needs doctrine was developed, and is ordinarily employed, precisely to enable searches by law enforcement officials who, of course, ordinarily have a law enforcement objective. Thus, in Griffin v. Wisconsin, 483 U.S. 868 (1987), a probation officer received a tip from a detective that petitioner, a felon on parole, possessed a firearm. Accompanied by police, he conducted a warrantless search of petitioner's home. The weapon was found and used as evidence in the probationer's trial for unlawful possession of a firearm. See id., at 870-872. Affirming denial of a motion to suppress, we concluded that the \"special need\" of assuring compliance with terms of release justified a warrantless search of petitioner's home. Notably, we observed that a probation officer is not \"the police officer who normally conducts searches against the ordinary citizen. He is an employee of the State Department of Health and Social Services who, while assuredly charged with protecting the public interest, is also supposed to have in mind the welfare of the probationer . . . . In such a setting, we think it reasonable to dispense with the warrant requirement.\" Id., at 876-877.~    ~    ~      47~      Like the probation officer, the doctors here do not \"ordinarily conduc[t] searches against the ordinary citizen,\" and they are \"supposed to have in mind the welfare of the [mother and child].\" That they have in mind in addition the provision of evidence to the police should make no difference. The Court suggests that if police involvement in this case was in some way incidental and after-the-fact, that would make a difference in the outcome. See ante, at 12-16. But in Griffin, even more than here, police were involved in the search from the very beginning; indeed, the initial tip about the gun came from a detective. Under the factors relied upon by the Court, the use of evidence approved in Griffin would have been permitted only if the parole officer had been untrained in chain-of-custody procedures, had not known of the possibility a gun was present, and had been unaccompanied by police when he simply happened upon the weapon. Why any or all of these is constitutionally significant is baffling.~    ~    ~      48~      Petitioners seek to distinguish Griffin by observing that probationers enjoy a lesser expectation of privacy than does the general public. That is irrelevant to the point I make here, which is that the presence of a law enforcement purpose does not render the special-needs doctrine inapplicable. In any event, I doubt whether Griffin's reasonable expectation of privacy in his home was any less than petitioners' reasonable expectation of privacy in their urine taken, or in the urine tests performed, in a hospital-especially in a State such as South Carolina, which recognizes no physician-patient testimonial privilege and requires the physician's duty of confidentiality to yield to public policy, see McCormick v. England, 328 S. C. 627, 633, 640-642, 494 S. E. 2d 431, 434, 438-439 (Ct. App. 1997); and which requires medical conditions that indicate a violation of the law to be reported to authorities, see, e.g., S. C. Code Ann. 20-7-510 (2000) (child abuse). Cf. Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 597-598 (1977) (privacy interest does not forbid government to require hospitals to provide, for law enforcement purposes, names of patients receiving prescriptions of frequently abused drugs).~    ~    ~      49~      The concurrence makes essentially the same basic error as the Court, though it puts the point somewhat differently: \"The special needs cases we have decided,\" it says, \"do not sustain the active use of law enforcement . . . as an integral part of a program which seeks to achieve legitimate, civil objectives.\" Ante, at 3. Griffin shows that is not true. Indeed, Griffin shows that there is not even any truth in the more limited proposition that our cases do not support application of the special-needs exception where the \"legitimate, civil objectives\" are sought only through the use of law enforcement means. (Surely the parole officer in Griffin was using threat of reincarceration to assure compliance with parole). But even if this latter proposition were true, it would invalidate what occurred here only if the drug testing sought exclusively the \"ultimate\" health benefits achieved by coercing the mothers into drug treatment through threat of prosecution. But in fact the drug testing sought, independently of law enforcement involvement, the \"immediate\" health benefits of identifying drug-impaired mother and child for necessary medical treatment. The concurrence concedes that if the testing is conducted for medical reasons, the fact that \"prosecuting authorities then adopt legitimate procedures to discover this information and prosecution follows . . . ought not to invalidate the testing.\" Ante, at 5 (emphasis added). But here the police involvement in each case did take place after the testing was conducted for independent reasons. Surely the concurrence cannot mean that no police-suggested procedures (such as preserving the chain of custody of the urine sample) can be applied until after the testing; or that the police-suggested procedures must have been designed after the testing. The facts in Griffin (and common sense) show that this cannot be so. It seems to me that the only real distinction between what the concurrence must reasonably be thought to be approving, and what we have here, is that here the police took the lesser step of initially threatening prosecution rather than bringing it.~    ~    ~      50~      * * *~    ~    ~      51~      As I indicated at the outset, it is not the function of this Court-at least not in Fourth Amendment cases-to weigh petitioners' privacy interest against the State's interest in meeting the crisis of \"crack babies\" that developed in the late 1980's. I cannot refrain from observing, however, that the outcome of a wise weighing of those interests is by no means clear. The initial goal of the doctors and nurses who conducted cocaine-testing in this case was to refer pregnant drug addicts to treatment centers, and to prepare for necessary treatment of their possibly affected children. When the doctors and nurses agreed to the program providing test results to the police, they did so because (in addition to the fact that child abuse was required by law to be reported) they wanted to use the sanction of arrest as a strong incentive for their addicted patients to undertake drug-addiction treatment. And the police themselves used it for that benign purpose, as is shown by the fact that only 30 of 253 women testing positive for cocaine were ever arrested, and only 2 of those prosecuted. See App. 1125-1126. It would not be unreasonable to conclude that today's judgment, authorizing the assessment of damages against the county solicitor and individual doctors and nurses who participated in the program, proves once again that no good deed goes unpunished.~    ~    ~      52~      But as far as the Fourth Amendment is concerned: There was no unconsented search in this case. And if there was, it would have been validated by the special-needs doctrine. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         The Court asserts that it is improper to \"disaggregate the taking and testing of the urine sample from the reporting of the results to the police,\" because \"in our special needs cases, we have routinely treated urine screens taken by state agents as searches within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\" Ante, at 8, n. 9. But in all of those cases, the urine was obtained involuntarily. See Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305 (1997); Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646 (1995); Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn., 489 U.S. 602 (1989); Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U.S. 656 (1989). Where the taking of the urine sample is unconsented (and thus a Fourth Amendment search), the subsequent testing and reporting of the results to the police are obviously part of (or infected by) the same search; but where, as here, the taking of the sample was not a Fourth Amendment search, it is necessary to consider separately whether the testing and reporting were.~      ~      ~        2~         Hoffa did say that the Fourth Amendment can be violated by \"guileful as well as by forcible intrusions into a constitutionally protected area.\" 385 U.S., at 301. The case it cited for that proposition, however, shows what it meant: Gouled v. United States, 255 U.S. 298 (1921), found a Fourth Amendment violation where a Government agent who had obtained access to the defendant's office on pretext of a social visit carried away private papers. \"Guile\" (rather than force) had been used to go beyond the scope of the consented access to evidence. Whereas the search in Gouled was invalidated, the search was approved in Lewis v. United States, 385 U.S. 206 (1966), where an equally guileful agent stayed within the bounds of the access to defendant's home, carrying away only a package of drugs that had been voluntarily provided.~      ~      ~        3~         The Court contends that its opinion does not leave law enforcement officials in the dark as to when they can use incriminating evidence from trusted sources, since it \"do[es] not address a case in which doctors independently complied with reporting requirements,\" ante, at 17, n. 24. I find it hard to understand how not addressing that point fails to leave it enshrouded in darkness-unless the Court means that such reporting requirements are clearly bad. (If voluntary betrayal of a trust in mere cooperation with the police constitutes a Fourth Amendment search, surely betrayal of a trust at the direction of the legislature must be.) But in any event, reporting requirements are an infinitesimal part of the problem. What about a doctor's-or a spouse's-voluntary provision of information to the police, without the compulsion of a statute?~      ~      ~        4~         The Court contends that I am \"mischaracteriz[ing]\" its opinion, since the Court is merely \"assum[ing] for purposes of decision that the patients did not consent to the searches, and [leaves] the question of consent for the Court of Appeals to determine.\" Ante, at 17, n. 24. That is not responsive. The \"question of consent\" that the Court leaves open is whether the patients consented, not merely to the taking of the urine samples, but to the drug testing in particular, and to the provision of the results to the police. Consent to the taking of the samples alone-or even to the taking of the samples plus the drug testing-does not suffice. The Court's contention that the question of the sufficiency of that more limited consent is not before us because respondents did not raise it, see ante, at 6, n. 6, is simply mistaken. Part II of respondents' brief, entitled \"The Petitioners consented to the searches,\" argues that \"Petitioners . . . freely and voluntarily . . . provided the urine samples\"; that \"each of the Petitioners signed a consent to treatment form which authorized the MUSC medical staff to conduct all necessary tests of those urine samples-including drug tests\"; and that \"[t]here is no precedent in this Court's Fourth Amendment search and seizure jurisprudence which imposes any . . . requirement that the searching agency inform the consenting party that the results of the search will be turned over to law enforcement.\" Brief for Respondent 38-39. The brief specifically takes issue with the District Court's charge to the jury-which the Court chooses to accept as an unexaminable \"given,\" see ante, at 6, n. 6-that \"the Respondents were required to show that the Petitioners consented to MUSC disclosing the information to law enforcement.\" Brief for Respondent 39. In sum, I think it clear that the Court's disposition requires the holding that violation of a relationship of trust constitutes a search. The opinion itself implies that in its description of the issue left for the Court of Appeals on remand, see ante, at 9, n. 11: whether \"the tests were performed without the informed consent of the patients,\" ante, at 9 (emphasis added)-informed, that is, that the urine would be tested for drugs and that the results would be given to the police. I am happy, of course, to accept the Court's illogical assurance that it intends no such holding, and urge the Court of Appeals on remand to do the same.~      ~      ~        5~         See, e.g., Cal. Penal Code Ann. 11160 (West Supp. 2001); N. Y. Penal Law 265.25 (McKinney 2000); S. C. Code Ann. 16-3-1072 (Supp. 2000).~      ~      ~        6~         See, e.g., Cal. Penal Code Ann. 11160 (West Supp. 2001); Colo. Rev. Stat. 12-36-135 (2000).~      ~      ~        7~         The Court contends that I \"would have us . . . resolve the issue of consent in favor of respondents,\" whereas the Court's opinion \"more prudent[ly] allow[s] [the Court of Appeals] to resolve the legal and factual issues in the first instance, and . . . express[es] no view on those issues.\" Ante at 9, n. 11. That is not entirely so. The Court does not resolve the factual issue of whether there was consent to the drug testing and to providing the results to the police; and neither do I. But the Court does resolve the legal issue of whether that consent was necessary, see ante, at 8-9, 16-18, n. 24; and so do I. Since the Court concludes it was necessary, the factual inquiry is left for the Fourth Circuit on remand. Since I conclude it was not necessary (and since no one contends that the taking of the urine sample was unconsented), there is on my analysis no factual consent issue remaining.~      ~      ~        8~         The Court believes that this finding \"must be read in light of \" the District Court's comment that \" 'these searches were not done by the medical university for independent purposes. . . . [T]he police came in and there was an agreement reached that the positive screens would be shared with the police. And then the screen is not done independent of police, it's done in conjunction with the police and that implicates the Fourth Amendment.' \" Ante, at 7, n. 8, quoting App. 1247-1249. But all this shows is that the explicit finding of medical purpose was not a finding of exclusive medical purpose. As discussed later in text, the special-needs doctrine contains no such exclusivity requirement.~      ~    ~    ",

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.DONNA RAE EGELHOFF, PETITIONERv.SAMANTHA EGELHOFF, a minor, by and through her natural parent KATE BREINER, and DAVID EGELHOFF~    No. 99-1529.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued November 8, 2000~    Decided March 21, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      While David A. Egelhoff was married to petitioner, he designated her as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy and pension plan provided by his employer and governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Shortly after petitioner and Mr. Egelhoff divorced, Mr. Egelhoff died intestate. Respondents, Mr. Egelhoff's children by a previous marriage, filed separate suits against petitioner in state court to recover the insurance proceeds and pension plan benefits. They relied on a Washington statute that provides that the designation of a spouse as the beneficiary of a nonprobate asset-defined to include a life insurance policy or employee benefit plan-is revoked automatically upon divorce. Respondents argued that in the absence of a qualified named beneficiary, the proceeds would pass to them as Mr. Egelhoff's statutory heirs under state law. The trial courts concluded that both the insurance policy and the pension plan should be administered in accordance with ERISA, and granted petitioner summary judgment in both cases. The Washington Court of Appeals consolidated the cases and reversed, concluding that the statute was not pre-empted by ERISA. The State Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the statute, although applicable to employee benefit plans, does not \"refe[r] to\" or have a \"connection with\" an ERISA plan that would compel pre-emption under that statute.~      Held: The state statute has a connection with ERISA plans and is therefore expressly pre-empted. Pp. 4-10.~      (a) ERISA's pre-emption section, 29 U.S.C.  1144(a), states that ERISA \"shall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan\" covered by ERISA. A state law relates to an ERISA plan \"if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.\" Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U.S. 85, 97. To determine whether there is a forbidden connection, the Court looks both to ERISA's objectives as a guide to the scope of the state law that Congress understood would survive, as well as to the nature of the state law's effect on ERISA plans. California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham Constr., N. A., Inc., 519 U.S. 316, 325. Applying this framework, the state statute has an impermissible connection with ERISA plans, as it binds plan administrators to a particular choice of rules for determining beneficiary status. Administrators must pay benefits to the beneficiaries chosen by state law, rather than to those identified in the plan documents. The statute thus implicates an area of core ERISA concern, running counter to ERISA's commands that a plan shall \"specify the basis on which payments are made to and from the plan,\" 1102(b)(4), and that the fiduciary shall administer the plan \"in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan,\" 1104(a)(1)(D). The state statute also has a prohibited connection with ERISA plans because it interferes with nationally uniform plan administration. Administrators cannot make payments simply by identifying the beneficiary specified in the plan documents, but must familiarize themselves with state statutes so that they can determine whether the named beneficiary's status has been \"revoked\" by operation of law. The burden is exacerbated by the choice-of-law problems that may confront an administrator when the employer, the plan participant, and the participant's former spouse live in different States. Although the Washington statute provides protection for administrators who have no actual knowledge of a divorce, they still face the risk that a court might later find that they did have such knowledge. If they instead decide to await the results of litigation among putative beneficiaries before paying benefits, they will simply transfer to the beneficiaries the costs of delay and uncertainty. Requiring administrators to master the relevant laws of 50 States and to contend with litigation would undermine the congressional goal of minimizing their administrative and financial burdens. Differing state regulations affecting an ERISA plan's system for processing claims and paying benefits impose precisely the burden that ERISA pre-emption was intended to avoid. Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U.S. 1, 10. Pp. 4-8.~      (b) Respondents' reasons why ordinary ERISA pre-emption analysis should not apply here-that the state statute allows employers to opt out; that it involves areas of traditional state regulation; and that if ERISA pre-empts this statute, it also must pre-empt the various state statutes providing that a murdering heir is not entitled to receive property as a result of the killing-are rejected. Pp. 8-10.~      139 Wash. 2d 557, 989 P.2d 80, reversed and remanded.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF WASHINGTON~      Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, and Ginsburg, JJ., joined. Scalia, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Ginsburg, J., joined. Breyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Stevens, J., joined.       Opinion of the Court~      Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      A Washington statute provides that the designation of a spouse as the beneficiary of a nonprobate asset is revoked automatically upon divorce. We are asked to decide whether the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 88 Stat. 832, 29 U.S.C.  1001 et seq., pre-empts that statute to the extent it applies to ERISA plans. We hold that it does.~    ~    ~      2~      * Petitioner Donna Rae Egelhoff was married to David A. Egelhoff. Mr. Egelhoff was employed by the Boeing Company, which provided him with a life insurance policy and a pension plan. Both plans were governed by ERISA, and Mr. Egelhoff designated his wife as the beneficiary under both. In April 1994, the Egelhoffs divorced. Just over two months later, Mr. Egelhoff died intestate following an automobile accident. At that time, Mrs. Egelhoff remained the listed beneficiary under both the life insurance policy and the pension plan. The life insurance proceeds, totaling $46,000, were paid to her.~    ~    ~      3~      Respondents Samantha and David Egelhoff, Mr. Egelhoff's children by a previous marriage, are his statutory heirs under state law. They sued petitioner in Washington state court to recover the life insurance proceeds. Respondents relied on a Washington statute that provides:~    ~    ~      4~      \"If a marriage is dissolved or invalidated, a provision made prior to that event that relates to the payment or transfer at death of the decedent's interest in a nonprobate asset in favor of or granting an interest or power to the decedent's former spouse is revoked. A provision affected by this section must be interpreted, and the nonprobate asset affected passes, as if the former spouse failed to survive the decedent, having died at the time of entry of the decree of dissolution or declaration of invalidity.\" Wash. Rev. Code 11.07.010(2)(a) (1994).~    ~    ~      5~      That statute applies to \"all nonprobate assets, wherever situated, held at the time of entry by a superior court of this state of a decree of dissolution of marriage or a declaration of invalidity.\" 11.07.010(1). It defines \"nonprobate asset\" to include \"a life insurance policy, employee benefit plan, annuity or similar contract, or individual retirement account.\" 11.07.010(5)(a).~    ~    ~      6~      Respondents argued that they were entitled to the life insurance proceeds because the Washington statute disqualified Mrs. Egelhoff as a beneficiary, and in the absence of a qualified named beneficiary, the proceeds would pass to them as Mr. Egelhoff's heirs. In a separate action, respondents also sued to recover the pension plan benefits. Respondents again argued that the Washington statute disqualified Mrs. Egelhoff as a beneficiary and they were thus entitled to the benefits under the plan.~    ~    ~      7~      The trial courts, concluding that both the insurance policy and the pension plan \"should be administered in accordance\" with ERISA, granted summary judgment to petitioner in both cases. App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a, 48a. The Washington Court of Appeals consolidated the cases and reversed. In re Estate of Egelhoff, 93 Wash. App. 314, 968 P.2d 924 (1998). It concluded that the Washington statute was not pre-empted by ERISA. Id., at 317, 968 P.2d, at 925. Applying the statute, it held that respondents were entitled to the proceeds of both the insurance policy and the pension plan. Ibid.~    ~    ~      8~      The Supreme Court of Washington affirmed. 139 Wash. 2d 557, 989 P.2d 80 (1999). It held that the state statute, although applicable to \"employee benefit plan[s],\" does not \"refe[r] to\" ERISA plans to an extent that would require pre-emption, because it \"does not apply immediately and exclusively to an ERISA plan, nor is the existence of such a plan essential to operation of the statute.\" Id., at 574, 989 P.2d, at 89. It also held that the statute lacks a \"connection with\" an ERISA plan that would compel pre-emption. Id., at 576, 989 P.2d, at 90. It emphasized that the statute \"does not alter the nature of the plan itself, the administrator's fiduciary duties, or the requirements for plan administration.\" Id., at 575, 989 P.2d, at 90. Nor, the court concluded, does the statute conflict with any specific provision of ERISA, including the antialienation provision, 29 U.S.C.  1056(d)(1), because it \"does not operate to divert benefit plan proceeds from distribution under terms of the plan documents,\" but merely alters \"the underlying circumstances to which the distribution scheme of [the] plan must be applied.\" 139 Wash. 2d, at 578, 989 P.2d, at 91.~    ~    ~      9~      Courts have disagreed about whether statutes like that of Washington are pre-empted by ERISA. Compare, e.g., Manning v. Hayes, 212 F.3d 866 (CA5 2000) (finding pre-emption), cert. pending, No. 00-265, and Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Hanslip, 939 F.2d 904 (CA10 1991) (same), with, e.g., Emard v. Hughes Aircraft Co., 153 F.3d 949 (CA9 1998) (finding no pre-emption), and 139 Wash. 2d, at 557, 989 P.2d, at 80 (same). To resolve the conflict, we granted certiorari. 530 U.S. 1242 (2000).~    ~    II~    ~      10~      Petitioner argues that the Washington statute falls within the terms of ERISA's express pre-emption provision and that it is pre-empted by ERISA under traditional principles of conflict pre-emption. Because we conclude that the statute is expressly pre-empted by ERISA, we address only the first argument.~    ~    ~      11~      ERISA's pre-emption section, 29 U.S.C.  1144(a), states that ERISA \"shall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan\" covered by ERISA. We have observed repeatedly that this broadly worded provision is \"clearly expansive.\" New York State Conference of Blue Cross  Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U.S. 645, 655 (1995); see, e.g., Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. 374, 384 (1992) (listing cases in which we have described ERISA pre-emption in broad terms). But at the same time, we have recognized that the term \"relate to\" cannot be taken \"to extend to the furthest stretch of its indeterminacy,\" or else \"for all practical purposes pre-emption would never run its course.\" Travelers, supra, at 655.~    ~    ~      12~      We have held that a state law relates to an ERISA plan \"if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.\" Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U.S. 85, 97 (1983). Petitioner focuses on the \"connection with\" part of this inquiry. Acknowledging that \"connection with\" is scarcely more restrictive than \"relate to,\" we have cautioned against an \"uncritical literalism\" that would make preemption turn on \"infinite connections.\" Travelers, supra, at 656. Instead, \"to determine whether a state law has the forbidden connection, we look both to 'the objectives of the ERISA statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that Congress understood would survive,' as well as to the nature of the effect of the state law on ERISA plans.\" California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham Constr., N. A., Inc., 519 U.S. 316, 325 (1997), quoting Travelers, supra, at 656 (citation omitted).~    ~    ~      13~      Applying this framework, petitioner argues that the Washington statute has an impermissible connection with ERISA plans. We agree. The statute binds ERISA plan administrators to a particular choice of rules for determining beneficiary status. The administrators must pay benefits to the beneficiaries chosen by state law, rather than to those identified in the plan documents. The statute thus implicates an area of core ERISA concern. In particular, it runs counter to ERISA's commands that a plan shall \"specify the basis on which payments are made to and from the plan,\" 1102(b)(4), and that the fiduciary shall administer the plan \"in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan,\" 1104(a)(1)(D), making payments to a \"beneficiary\" who is \"designated by a participant, or by the terms of [the] plan.\" 1002(8).1 In other words, unlike generally applicable laws regulating \"areas where ERISA has nothing to say,\" Dillingham, 519 U.S., at 330, which we have upheld notwithstanding their incidental effect on ERISA plans, see, e.g., ibid., this statute governs the payment of benefits, a central matter of plan administration.~    ~    ~      14~      The Washington statute also has a prohibited connection with ERISA plans because it interferes with nationally uniform plan administration. One of the principal goals of ERISA is to enable employers \"to establish a uniform administrative scheme, which provides a set of standard procedures to guide processing of claims and disbursement of benefits.\" Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U.S. 1, 9 (1987). Uniformity is impossible, however, if plans are subject to different legal obligations in different States.~    ~    ~      15~      The Washington statute at issue here poses precisely that threat. Plan administrators cannot make payments simply by identifying the beneficiary specified by the plan documents.2 Instead they must familiarize themselves with state statutes so that they can determine whether the named beneficiary's status has been \"revoked\" by operation of law. And in this context the burden is exacerbated by the choice-of-law problems that may confront an administrator when the employer is located in one State, the plan participant lives in another, and the participant's former spouse lives in a third. In such a situation, administrators might find that plan payments are subject to conflicting legal obligations.~    ~    ~      16~      To be sure, the Washington statute protects administrators from liability for making payments to the named beneficiary unless they have \"actual knowledge of the dissolution or other invalidation of marriage,\" Wash. Rev. Code 11.07.010(3)(a) (1994), and it permits administrators to refuse to make payments until any dispute among putative beneficiaries is resolved, 11.07.010(3)(b). But if administrators do pay benefits, they will face the risk that a court might later find that they had \"actual knowledge\" of a divorce. If they instead decide to await the results of litigation before paying benefits, they will simply transfer to the beneficiaries the costs of delay and uncertainty.3 Requiring ERISA administrators to master the relevant laws of 50 States and to contend with litigation would undermine the congressional goal of \"minimiz[ing] the administrative and financial burden[s]\" on plan administrators-burdens ultimately borne by the beneficiaries. Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U.S. 133, 142 (1990).~    ~    ~      17~      We recognize that all state laws create some potential for a lack of uniformity. But differing state regulations affecting an ERISA plan's \"system for processing claims and paying benefits\" impose \"precisely the burden that ERISA pre-emption was intended to avoid.\" Fort Halifax, supra, at 10. And as we have noted, the statute at issue here directly conflicts with ERISA's requirements that plans be administered, and benefits be paid, in accordance with plan documents. We conclude that the Washington statute has a \"connection with\" ERISA plans and is therefore pre-empted.~    ~    III~    ~      18~      Respondents suggest several reasons why ordinary ERISA pre-emption analysis should not apply here. First, they observe that the Washington statute allows employers to opt out. According to respondents, the statute neither regulates plan administration nor impairs uniformity because it does not apply when \"[t]he instrument governing disposition of the nonprobate asset expressly provides otherwise.\" Wash. Rev. Code 11.07.010(2)(b)(i) (1994). We do not believe that the statute is saved from pre-emption simply because it is, at least in a broad sense, a default rule.~    ~    ~      19~      Even though the Washington statute's cancellation of private choice may itself be trumped by specific language in the plan documents, the statute does \"dictate the choice[s] facing ERISA plans\" with respect to matters of plan administration. Dillingham, supra, at 334. Plan administrators must either follow Washington's beneficiary designation scheme or alter the terms of their plan so as to indicate that they will not follow it. The statute is not any less of a regulation of the terms of ERISA plans simply because there are two ways of complying with it. Of course, simple noncompliance with the statute is not one of the options available to plan administrators. Their only choice is one of timing, i.e., whether to bear the burden of compliance ex post, by paying benefits as the statute dictates (and in contravention of the plan documents), or ex ante, by amending the plan.4~    ~    ~      20~      Respondents emphasize that the opt-out provision makes compliance with the statute less burdensome than if it were mandatory. That is true enough, but the burden that remains is hardly trivial. It is not enough for plan administrators to opt out of this particular statute. Instead, they must maintain a familiarity with the laws of all 50 States so that they can update their plans as necessary to satisfy the opt-out requirements of other, similar statutes. They also must be attentive to changes in the interpretations of those statutes by state courts. This \"tailoring of plans and employer conduct to the peculiarities of the law of each jurisdiction\" is exactly the burden ERISA seeks to eliminate. Ingersoll-Rand, supra, at 142.~    ~    ~      21~      Second, respondents emphasize that the Washington statute involves both family law and probate law, areas of traditional state regulation. There is indeed a presumption against pre-emption in areas of traditional state regulation such as family law. See, e.g., Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo, 439 U.S. 572, 581 (1979). But that presumption can be overcome where, as here, Congress has made clear its desire for pre-emption. Accordingly, we have not hesitated to find state family law pre-empted when it conflicts with ERISA or relates to ERISA plans. See, e.g., Boggs v. Boggs, 520 U.S. 833 (1997) (holding that ERISA pre-empts a state community property law permitting the testamentary transfer of an interest in a spouse's pension plan benefits).~    ~    ~      22~      Finally, respondents argue that if ERISA pre-empts this statute, then it also must pre-empt the various state statutes providing that a murdering heir is not entitled to receive property as a result of the killing. See, e.g., Cal. Prob. Code Ann. 250-259 (West 1991 and Supp. 2000); 755 Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 755, 5/2-6 (1999). In the ERISA context, these \"slayer\" statutes could revoke the beneficiary status of someone who murdered a plan participant. Those statutes are not before us, so we do not decide the issue. We note, however, that the principle underlying the statutes-which have been adopted by nearly every State-is well established in the law and has a long historical pedigree predating ERISA. See, e.g., Riggs v. Palmer, 115 N. Y. 506, 22 N. E. 188 (1889). And because the statutes are more or less uniform nationwide, their interference with the aims of ERISA is at least debatable.~    ~    ~      23~      * * *~    ~    ~      24~      The judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      25~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         One can of course escape the conflict between the plan documents (which require making payments to the named beneficiary) and the statute (which requires making payments to someone else) by calling the statute an \"invalidation\" of the designation of the named beneficiary, and by observing that the plan documents are silent on whether \"invalidation\" is to occur upon divorce. The dissent employs just such an approach. See post, at 3-4 (opinion of Breyer, J.). Reading a clear statement as an ambiguous metastatement enables one to avoid all kinds of conflicts between seemingly contradictory texts. Suppose, for example, that the statute required that all pension benefits be paid to the Governor of Washington. That seems inconsistent with the plan documents (and with ERISA), but the inconsistency disappears if one calls the statute an \"invalidation\" of the principal and alternate beneficiary designations. After all, neither the plan nor ERISA actually says that beneficiaries cannot be invalidated in favor of the Governor. This approach exploits the logical inability of any text to contain a complete set of instructions for its own interpretation. It has the vice-or perhaps the virtue, depending upon one's point of view-of draining all language of its meaning.~      ~      ~        2~         Respondents argue that in this case, the disposition dictated by the Washington statute is consistent with that specified in the plan documents. Because Mr. Egelhoff designated \"Donna R. Egelhoff Wife\" as the beneficiary of the life insurance policy, they contend that once the Egelhoffs divorced, \"there was no such person as 'Donna R. Egelhoff Wife'; the designated person had definitionally ceased to exist.\" Brief for Respondents 44 (emphasis in original); see also post, at 3 (Breyer, J., dissenting). In effect, respondents ask us to infer that what Mr. Egelhoff meant when he filled out the form was not \"Donna R. Egelhoff, who is my wife,\" but rather \"a new legal person-'Donna as spouse,' \" Brief for Respondents 44. They do not mention, however, that below the \"Beneficiary\" line on the form, the printed text reads, \"First Name [space] Middle Initial [space] Last Name [space] Relationship.\" See Appendix to opinion of Breyer, J., post. Rather than impute to Mr. Egelhoff the unnatural (and indeed absurd) literalism suggested by respondents, we conclude that he simply provided all of the information requested by the form. The happenstance that \"Relationship\" was on the same line as the beneficiary's name does not, we think, evince an intent to designate \"a new legal person.\"~      ~      ~        3~         The dissent observes that the Washington statute permits a plan administrator to avoid resolving the dispute himself and to let courts or parties settle the matter. See post, at 6. This observation only presents an example of how the costs of delay and uncertainty can be passed on to beneficiaries, thereby thwarting ERISA's objective of efficient plan administration. Cf. Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U.S. 1, 9 (1987).~      ~      ~        4~         Contrary to the dissent's suggestion that the resolution of this case depends on one's view of federalism, see post, at 8-9, we are called upon merely to interpret ERISA. And under the text of ERISA, the fiduciary \"shall\" administer the plan \"in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan,\" 29 U.S.C.  1104(a)(1)(D). The Washington statute conflicts with this command because under this statute, the only way the fiduciary can administer the plan according to its terms is to change the very terms he is supposed to follow.~      ~    ~    Scalia, J., concurring~    ~      26~      Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, concurring.~    ~    ~      27~      I join the opinion of the Court, since I believe that the \"relate to\" pre-emptive provision of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) is assuredly triggered by a state law that contradicts ERISA. As the Court notes, \"the statute at issue here directly conflicts with ERISA's requirements that plans be administered, and benefits be paid, in accordance with plan documents.\" Ante, at 7. I remain unsure (as I think the lower courts and everyone else will be) as to what else triggers the \"relate to\" provision, which-if it is interpreted to be anything other than a reference to our established jurisprudence concerning conflict and field pre-emption-has no discernible content that would not pick up every ripple in the pond, producing a result \"that no sensible person could have intended.\" California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham Constr., N. A., Inc., 519 U.S. 316, 336 (1997) (Scalia, J., concurring). I persist in the view that we can bring some coherence to this area, and can give the statute both a plausible and precise content, only by interpreting the \"relate to\" clause as a reference to our ordinary pre-emption jurisprudence. See ibid.~    ~    Breyer, J., dissenting~    ~      28~      Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens joins, dissenting.~    ~    ~      29~      Like Justice Scalia, I believe that we should apply normal conflict pre-emption and field pre-emption principles where, as here, a state statute covers ERISA and non-ERISA documents alike. Ante, at 1 (concurring opinion). Our more recent ERISA cases are consistent with this approach. See De Buono v. NYSA-ILA Medical and Clinical Services Fund, 520 U.S. 806, 812-813 (1997) (rejecting literal interpretation of ERISA's pre-emption clause); California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham Constr., N. A., Inc., 519 U.S. 316, 334 (1997) (narrowly interpreting the clause); New York State Conference of Blue Cross  Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U.S. 645, 656 (1995) (\"go[ing] beyond the unhelpful text [of the clause] and the frustrating difficulty of defining its key term, and look[ing] instead to the objectives of the ERISA statute as a guide\"). See also Boggs v. Boggs, 520 U.S. 833, 841 (1997) (relying on conflict pre-emption principles instead of ERISA's pre-emption clause). And I fear that our failure to endorse this \"new approach\" explicitly, Dillingham, supra, at 336 (Scalia, J., concurring), will continue to produce an \"avalanche of litigation,\" De Buono, supra, at 809, n. 1, as courts struggle to interpret a clause that lacks any \"discernible content,\" ante, at 1 (Scalia, J., concurring), threatening results that Congress could not have intended.~    ~    ~      30~      I do not agree with Justice Scalia or with the majority, however, that there is any plausible pre-emption principle that leads to a conclusion that ERISA pre-empts the statute at issue here. No one could claim that ERISA pre-empts the entire field of state law governing inheritance-though such matters \"relate to\" ERISA broadly speaking. See Travelers, supra, at 655. Neither is there any direct conflict between the Washington statute and ERISA, for the one nowhere directly contradicts the other. Cf. ante, at 7 (claiming a \"direc[t] conflic[t]\" between ERISA and the Washington statute). But cf. ante, at 4 (relying upon the \"relate to\" language in ERISA's pre-emption clause).~    ~    ~      31~      The Court correctly points out that ERISA requires a fiduciary to make payments to a beneficiary \"in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan.\" 29 U.S.C.  1104(a)(1)(D). But nothing in the Washington statute requires the contrary. Rather, the state statute simply sets forth a default rule for interpreting documentary silence. The statute specifies that a nonprobate asset will pass at A's death \"as if\" A's \"former spouse\" had died first-unless the \"instrument governing disposition of the nonprobate asset expressly provides otherwise.\" Wash. Rev. Code 11.07.010(2)(b)(i) (1994) (emphasis added). This state-law rule is a rule of interpretation, and it is designed to carry out, not to conflict with, the employee's likely intention as revealed in the plan documents.~    ~    ~      32~      There is no direct conflict or contradiction between the Washington statute and the terms of the plan documents here at issue. David Egelhoff's investment plan provides that when a \"beneficiary designation\" is \"invalid,\" the \"benefits will be paid\" to a \"surviving spouse,\" or \"if there is no surviving spouse,\" to the \"children in equal shares.\" App. 40. The life insurance plan is silent about what occurs when a beneficiary designation is invalid. The Washington statute fills in these gaps, i.e., matters about which the documents themselves say nothing. Thus, the Washington statute specifies that a beneficiary designation-here \"Donna R. Egelhoff wife\" in the pension plan-is invalid where there is no longer any such person as Donna R. Egelhoff, wife. See Appendix, infra. And the statute adds that in such instance the funds would be paid to the children, who themselves are potential pension plan beneficiaries.~    ~    ~      33~      The Court's \"direct conflict\" conclusion rests upon its claim that \"administrators must pay benefits to the beneficiaries chosen by state law, rather than to those identified in the plan documents.\" Ante, at 5. But the Court cannot mean \"identified anywhere in the plan documents,\" for the Egelhoff children were \"identified\" as recipients in the pension plan documents should the initial designation to \"Donna R. Egelhoff wife\" become invalid. And whether that initial designation became invalid upon divorce is a matter about which the plan documents are silent.~    ~    ~      34~      To refer to state law to determine whether a given name makes a designation that is, or has become, invalid makes sense where background property or inheritance law is at issue, say, for example, where a written name is potentially ambiguous, where it is set forth near, but not in, the correct space, where it refers to a missing person perhaps presumed dead, where the name was written at a time the employee was incompetent, or where the name refers to an individual or entity disqualified by other law, say, the rule against perpetuities or rules prohibiting a murderer from benefiting from his crime. Why would Congress want the courts to create an ERISA-related federal property law to deal with such problems? Regardless, to refer to background state law in such circumstances does not directly conflict with any explicit ERISA provision, for no provision of ERISA forbids reading an instrument or document in light of state property law principles. In any event, in this case the plan documents explicitly foresee that a beneficiary designation may become \"invalid,\" but they do not specify the invalidating circumstances. Supra, at 3. To refer to state property law to fill in that blank can- not possibly create any direct conflict with the plan documents.~    ~    ~      35~      The majority simply denies that there is any blank to fill in and suggests that the plan documents require the plan to pay the designated beneficiary under all circumstances. See ante, at 5, n. 1. But there is nonetheless an open question, namely, whether a designation that (here explicitly) refers to a wife remains valid after divorce. The question is genuine and important (unlike the imaginary example in the majority's footnote). The plan documents themselves do not answer the question any more than they describe what is to occur in a host of other special circumstances (e.g., mental incompetence, intoxication, ambiguous names, etc.). To determine whether ERISA permits state law to answer such questions requires a careful examination of the particular state law in light of ERISA's basic policies. See ante, at 4-5; infra, at 5-8. We should not short-circuit that necessary inquiry simply by announcing a \"direct conflict\" where none exists.~    ~    ~      36~      The Court also complains that the Washington statute restricts the plan's choices to \"two.\" Ante, at 8. But it is difficult to take this complaint seriously. After all, the two choices that Washington gives the plan are (1) to comply with Washington's rule or (2) not to comply with Washington's rule. What other choices could there be? A state statute that asks a plan to choose whether it intends to comply is not a statute that directly conflicts with a plan. Quite obviously, it is possible, not \" 'impossible,' \" to comply with both the Washington statute and federal law. Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U.S. 861, 873 (2000).~    ~    ~      37~      The more serious pre-emption question is whether this state statute \" 'stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.' \" Ibid. (quoting Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 67 (1941)). In answering that question, we must remember that petitioner has to overcome a strong presumption against pre-emption. That is because the Washington statute governs family property law-a \"field of traditional state regulation,\" where courts will not find federal pre-emption unless such was the \" 'clear and manifest purpose of Congress,' \" Travelers, 514 U.S., at 655 (quoting Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947)), or the state statute does \" 'major damage' to 'clear and substantial' federal interests,\" Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo, 439 U.S. 572, 581 (1979) (quoting United States v. Yazell, 382 U.S. 341, 352 (1966)). No one can seriously argue that Congress has clearly resolved the question before us. And the only damage to federal interests that the Court identifies consists of the added administrative burden the state statute imposes upon ERISA plan administrators.~    ~    ~      38~      The Court claims that the Washington statute \"interferes with nationally uniform plan administration\" by requiring administrators to \"familiarize themselves with state statutes.\" Ante, at 6-7. But administrators have to familiarize themselves with state law in any event when they answer such routine legal questions as whether amounts due are subject to garnishment, Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency  Service, Inc., 486 U.S. 825, 838 (1988), who is a \"spouse,\" who qualifies as a \"child,\" or when an employee is legally dead. And were that \"familiarizing burden\" somehow overwhelming, the plan could easily avoid it by resolving the divorce revocation issue in the plan documents themselves, stating expressly that state law does not apply. The \"burden\" thus reduces to a one-time requirement that would fall primarily upon the few who draft model ERISA documents, not upon the many who administer them. So meager a burden cannot justify pre-empting a state law that enjoys a presumption against pre-emption.~    ~    ~      39~      The Court also fears that administrators would have to make difficult choice-of-law determinations when parties live in different States. Ante, at 6. Whether this problem is or is not \"major\" in practice, the Washington statute resolves it by expressly setting forth procedures whereby the parties or the courts, not the plan administrator, are responsible for resolving it. See 11.07.010(3)(b)(i)-(ii) (stating that a plan may \"without liability, refuse to pay or transfer a nonprobate asset\" until \"[a]ll beneficiaries and other interested persons claiming an interest have consented in writing to the payment or transfer\" or \"[t]he payment or transfer is authorized or directed by a court of proper jurisdiction\"); 11.07.010(3)(c) (plan may condition payment on provision of security by recipient to indemnify plan for costs); 11.07.010(2)(b)(i) (plan may avoid default rule by expressing its intent in the plan documents).~    ~    ~      40~      The Court has previously made clear that the fact that state law \"impose[s] some burde[n] on the administration of ERISA plans\" does not necessarily require pre-emption. De Buono, 520 U.S., at 815; Mackey, supra, at 831 (upholding state garnishment law notwithstanding claim that \"benefit plans subjected to garnishment will incur substantial administrative burdens\"). Precisely, what is it about this statute's requirement that distinguishes it from the \" 'myriad state laws' \" that impose some kind of burden on ERISA plans? De Buono, supra, at 815 (quoting Travelers, 514 U.S., at 668).~    ~    ~      41~      Indeed, if one looks beyond administrative burden, one finds that Washington's statute poses no obstacle, but furthers ERISA's ultimate objective-developing a fair system for protecting employee benefits. Cf. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. R. A. Gray  Co., 467 U.S. 717, 720 (1984). The Washington statute transfers an employee's pension assets at death to those individuals whom the worker would likely have wanted to receive them. As many jurisdictions have concluded, divorced workers more often prefer that a child, rather than a divorced spouse, receive those assets. Of course, an employee can secure this result by changing a beneficiary form; but doing so requires awareness, understanding, and time. That is why Washington and many other jurisdictions have created a statutory assumption that divorce works a revocation of a designation in favor of an ex-spouse. That assumption is embodied in the Uniform Probate Code; it is consistent with human experience; and those with expertise in the matter have concluded that it \"more often\" serves the cause of \"[j]ustice.\" Langbein, The Nonprobate Revolution and the Future of the Law of Succession, 97 Harv. L. Rev. 1108, 1135 (1984).~    ~    ~      42~      In forbidding Washington to apply that assumption here, the Court permits a divorced wife, who already acquired, during the divorce proceeding, her fair share of the couple's community property, to receive in addition the benefits that the divorce court awarded to her former husband. To be more specific, Donna Egelhoff already received a business, an IRA account, and stock; David received, among other things, 100% of his pension benefits. App. 31-34. David did not change the beneficiary designation in the pension plan or life insurance plan during the 6-month period between his divorce and his death. As a result, Donna will now receive a windfall of approximately $80,000 at the expense of David's children. The State of Washington enacted a statute to prevent precisely this kind of unfair result. But the Court, relying on an inconsequential administrative burden, concludes that Congress required it.~    ~    ~      43~      Finally, the logic of the Court's decision does not stop at divorce revocation laws. The Washington statute is virtually indistinguishable from other traditional state-law rules, for example, rules using presumptions to transfer assets in the case of simultaneous deaths, and rules that prohibit a husband who kills a wife from receiving benefits as a result of the wrongful death. It is particularly difficult to believe that Congress wanted to pre-empt the latter kind of statute. But how do these statutes differ from the one before us? Slayer statutes-like this statute-\"gover[n] the payment of benefits, a central matter of plan administration.\" Ante, at 5. And contrary to the Court's suggestion, ante, at 9-10, slayer statutes vary from State to State in their details just like divorce revocation statutes. Compare Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. 14-2803(F) (1995) (requiring proof, in a civil proceeding, under preponderance of the evidence standard); Haw. Rev. Stat. 560:2-803(g) (1999) (same), with Ga. Code Ann. 53-1-5(d) (1997) (requiring proof under clear and convincing evidence standard); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18-A, 2-803(e) (1998) (same); and Ala. Code. 43-8-253(e) (1991) (treating judgment of conviction as conclusive when it becomes final); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit 18-A, 2-803(e) (1998) (same), with Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. 14-2803(F) (1995) (treating judgment of conviction as conclusive only after \"all right to appeal has been exhausted\"); Haw. Rev. Stat. 560:2-803(g) (1999) (same). Indeed, the \"slayer\" conflict would seem more serious, not less serious, than the conflict before us, for few, if any, slayer statutes permit plans to opt out of the state property law rule.~    ~    ~      44~      \"ERISA pre-emption analysis,\" the Court has said, must \"respect\" the \"separate spher[e]\" of state \"authority.\" Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U.S. 1, 19 (1987) (quoting Alessi v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 451 U.S. 504, 522 (1981)) (internal quotation marks omitted). In so stating, the Court has recognized the practical importance of preserving local independence, at retail, i.e., by applying pre-emption analysis with care, statute by statute, line by line, in order to determine how best to reconcile a federal statute's language and purpose with federalism's need to preserve state autonomy. Indeed, in today's world, filled with legal complexity, the true test of federalist principle may lie, not in the occasional constitutional effort to trim Congress' commerce power at its edges, United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000), or to protect a State's treasury from a private damages action, Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. ___ (2001), but rather in those many statutory cases where courts interpret the mass of technical detail that is the ordinary diet of the law, ATT Corp. v. Iowa Utilities Bd., 525 U.S. 366, 427 (1999) (Breyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).~    ~    ~      45~      In this case, \"field pre-emption\" is not at issue. There is no \"direct\" conflict between state and federal statutes. The state statute poses no significant obstacle to the accomplishment of any federal objective. Any effort to squeeze some additional pre-emptive force from ERISA's words (i.e., \"relate to\") is inconsistent with the Court's recent case law. And the state statute before us is one regarding family property-a \"fiel[d] of traditional state regulation,\" where the interpretive presumption against pre-emption is particularly strong. Travelers, 514 U.S., at 655. For these reasons, I disagree with the Court's conclusion. And, consequently, I dissent.~    ~    ~      46~      APPENDIX TO OPINION OF BREYER, J.~    ~    ",

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.TEXAS, PETITIONERv.RAYMOND LEVI COBB~    No. 99-1702.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued January 16, 2001~    Decided April 2, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      While under arrest for an unrelated offense, respondent confessed to a home burglary, but denied knowledge of a woman and child's disappearance from the home. He was indicted for the burglary, and counsel was appointed to represent him. He later confessed to his father that he had killed the woman and child, and his father then contacted the police. While in custody, respondent waived his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, and confessed to the murders. He was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. On appeal to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, he argued, inter alia, that his confession should have been suppressed because it was obtained in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, which he claimed attached when counsel was appointed in the burglary case. The court reversed and remanded, holding that once the right to counsel attaches to the offense charged, it also attaches to any other offense that is very closely related factually to the offense charged.~      Held: Because the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is \"offense specific,\" it does not necessarily extend to offenses that are \"factually related\" to those that have actually been charged. Pp. 4-11.~      (a) In McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U.S. 171, 176, this Court held that a defendant's statements regarding offenses for which he has not been charged are admissible notwithstanding the attachment of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel on other charged offenses. Although some lower courts have read into McNeil's offense-specific definition an exception for crimes that are \"factually related\" to a charged offense, and have interpreted Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. 387, and Maine v. Moulton, 474 U.S. 159, to support this view, this Court declines to do so. Brewer did not address the question at issue here. And to the extent Moulton spoke to the matter at all, it expressly referred to the offense-specific nature of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. In predicting that the offense-specific rule will prove disastrous to suspects' constitutional rights and will permit the police almost total license to conduct unwanted and uncounseled interrogations, respondent fails to appreciate two critical considerations. First, there can be no doubt that a suspect must be apprised of his rights against compulsory self-incrimination and to consult with an attorney before authorities may conduct custodial interrogation. See Miranda, supra, at 479. Here, police scrupulously followed Miranda's dictates when questioning respondent. Second, the Constitution does not negate society's interest in the police's ability to talk to witnesses and suspects, even those who have been charged with other offenses. See McNeil, supra, at 181. Pp. 4-9.~      (b) Although the Sixth Amendment right to counsel clearly attaches only to charged offenses, this Court has recognized in other contexts that the definition of an \"offense\" is not necessarily limited to the four corners of a charging document. The test to determine whether there are two different offenses or only one is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not. Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 304. The Blockburger test has been applied to delineate the scope of the Fifth Amendment's Double Jeopardy Clause, which prevents multiple or successive prosecutions for the \"same offense.\" See, e.g., Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161, 164-166. There is no constitutional difference between \"offense\" in the double jeopardy and right-to-counsel contexts. Accordingly, when the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches, it encompasses offenses that, even if not formally charged, would be considered the same offense under the Blockburger test. Pp. 9-11.~      (c) At the time respondent confessed to the murders, he had been indicted for burglary but had not been charged in the murders. As defined by Texas law, these crimes are not the same offense under Blockburger. Thus, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel did not bar police from interrogating respondent regarding the murders, and his confession was therefore admissible. P. 11. ___ S.

Breyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg, JJ., joined.~      Opinion of the Court~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS OF TEXAS~      Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that a criminal defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches not only to the offense with which he is charged, but to other offenses \"closely related factually\" to the charged offense. We hold that our decision in McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U.S. 171 (1991), meant what it said, and that the Sixth Amendment right is \"offense specific.\"~    ~    ~      2~      In December 1993, Lindsey Owings reported to the Walker County, Texas, Sheriff's Office that the home he shared with his wife, Margaret, and their 16-month-old daughter, Kori Rae, had been burglarized. He also informed police that his wife and daughter were missing. Respondent Raymond Levi Cobb lived across the street from the Owings. Acting on an anonymous tip that respondent was involved in the burglary, Walker County investigators questioned him about the events. He denied involvement. In July 1994, while under arrest for an unrelated offense, respondent was again questioned about the incident. Respondent then gave a written statement confessing to the burglary, but he denied knowledge relating to the disappearances. Respondent was subsequently indicted for the burglary, and Hal Ridley was appointed in August 1994 to represent respondent on that charge.~    ~    ~      3~      Shortly after Ridley's appointment, investigators asked and received his permission to question respondent about the disappearances. Respondent continued to deny involvement. Investigators repeated this process in September 1995, again with Ridley's permission and again with the same result.~    ~    ~      4~      In November 1995, respondent, free on bond in the burglary case, was living with his father in Odessa, Texas. At that time, respondent's father contacted the Walker County Sheriff's Office to report that respondent had confessed to him that he killed Margaret Owings in the course of the burglary. Walker County investigators directed respondent's father to the Odessa police station, where he gave a statement. Odessa police then faxed the statement to Walker County, where investigators secured a warrant for respondent's arrest and faxed it back to Odessa. Shortly thereafter, Odessa police took respondent into custody and administered warnings pursuant to Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). Respondent waived these rights.~    ~    ~      5~      After a short time, respondent confessed to murdering both Margaret and Kori Rae. Respondent explained that when Margaret confronted him as he was attempting to remove the Owings' stereo, he stabbed her in the stomach with a knife he was carrying. Respondent told police that he dragged her body to a wooded area a few hundred yards from the house. Respondent then stated:~    ~    ~      6~      \"I went back to her house and I saw the baby laying on its bed. I took the baby out there and it was sleeping the whole time. I laid the baby down on the ground four or five feet away from its mother. I went back to my house and got a flat edge shovel. That's all I could find. Then I went back over to where they were and I started digging a hole between them. After I got the hole dug, the baby was awake. It started going toward its mom and it fell in the hole. I put the lady in the hole and I covered them up. I remember stabbing a different knife I had in the ground where they were. I was crying right then.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. A-9 to A-10.~    ~    ~      7~      Respondent later led police to the location where he had buried the victims' bodies.~    ~    ~      8~      Respondent was convicted of capital murder for murdering more than one person in the course of a single criminal transaction. See Texas Penal Code Ann. 19.03(a)(7)(A) (1994). He was sentenced to death. On appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas, respondent argued, inter alia, that his confession should have been suppressed because it was obtained in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Relying on Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U.S. 625 (1986), respondent contended that his right to counsel had attached when Ridley was appointed in the burglary case and that Odessa police were therefore required to secure Ridley's permission before proceeding with the interrogation.~    ~    ~      9~      The Court of Criminal Appeals reversed respondent's conviction by a divided vote and remanded for a new trial. The court held that \"once the right to counsel attaches to the offense charged, it also attaches to any other offense that is very closely related factually to the offense charged.\" ___ S. W. 3d ___ 2000 WL 275644, *3 (2000) (citations omitted). Finding the capital murder charge to be \"factually interwoven with the burglary,\" the court concluded that respondent's Sixth Amendment right to counsel had attached on the capital murder charge even though respondent had not yet been charged with that offense. Id., at *4. The court further found that respondent had asserted that right by accepting Ridley's appointment in the burglary case. See ibid. Accordingly, it deemed the confession inadmissible and found that its introduction had not been harmless error. See id., at *4-*5. Three justices dissented, finding Michigan v. Jackson to be distinguishable and concluding that respondent had made a valid unilateral waiver of his right to counsel before confessing. See 2000 WL, at *5-*13 (opinion of McCormick, P. J.).~    ~    ~      10~      The State sought review in this Court, and we granted certiorari to consider first whether the Sixth Amendment right to counsel extends to crimes that are \"factually related\" to those that have actually been charged, and second whether respondent made a valid unilateral waiver of that right in this case. 530 U.S. 1296 (2000). Because we answer the first question in the negative, we do not reach the second.~    ~    ~      11~      The Sixth Amendment provides that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\" In McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U.S. 171 (1991), we explained when this right arises:~    ~    ~      12~      \"The Sixth Amendment right [to counsel] ... is offense specific. It cannot be invoked once for all future prosecutions, for it does not attach until a prosecution is commenced, that is, at or after the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings-whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.\" Id., at 175 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).~    ~    ~      13~      Accordingly, we held that a defendant's statements regarding offenses for which he had not been charged were admissible notwithstanding the attachment of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel on other charged offenses. See id., at 176.~    ~    ~      14~      Some state courts and Federal Courts of Appeals, however, have read into McNeil's offense-specific definition an exception for crimes that are \"factually related\" to a charged offense.1 Several of these courts have interpreted Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. 387 (1977), and Maine v. Moulton, 474 U.S. 159 (1985)-both of which were decided well before McNeil-to support this view, which respondent now invites us to approve. We decline to do so.~    ~    ~      15~      In Brewer, a suspect in the abduction and murder of a 10-year-old girl had fled from the scene of the crime in Des Moines, Iowa, some 160 miles east to Davenport, Iowa, where he surrendered to police. An arrest warrant was issued in Des Moines on a charge of abduction, and the suspect was arraigned on that warrant before a Davenport judge. Des Moines police traveled to Davenport, took the man into custody, and began the drive back to Des Moines. Along the way, one of the officers persuaded the suspect to lead police to the victim's body. The suspect ultimately was convicted of the girl's murder. This Court upheld the federal habeas court's conclusion that police had violated the suspect's Sixth Amendment right to counsel. We held that the officer's comments to the suspect constituted interrogation and that the suspect had not validly waived his right to counsel by responding to the officer. See 430 U.S., at 405-406.~    ~    ~      16~      Respondent suggests that Brewer implicitly held that the right to counsel attached to the factually related murder when the suspect was arraigned on the abduction charge. See Brief for Respondent 4. The Court's opinion, however, simply did not address the significance of the fact that the suspect had been arraigned only on the abduction charge, nor did the parties in any way argue this question. Constitutional rights are not defined by inferences from opinions which did not address the question at issue. Cf. Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U.S. 528, 535, n. 5 (1974) (\"[W]hen questions of jurisdiction have been passed on in prior decisions sub silentio, this Court has never considered itself bound when a subsequent case finally brings the jurisdictional issue before us\").~    ~    ~      17~      Moulton is similarly unhelpful to respondent. That case involved two individuals indicted for a series of thefts, one of whom had secretly agreed to cooperate with the police investigation of his codefendant, Moulton. At the suggestion of police, the informant recorded several telephone calls and one face-to-face conversation he had with Moulton during which the two discussed their criminal exploits and possible alibis. In the course of those conversations, Moulton made various incriminating statements regarding both the thefts for which he had been charged and additional crimes. In a superseding indictment, Moulton was charged with the original crimes as well as burglary, arson, and three additional thefts. At trial, the State introduced portions of the recorded face-to-face conversation, and Moulton ultimately was convicted of three of the originally charged thefts plus one count of burglary. Moulton appealed his convictions to the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine, arguing that introduction of the recorded conversation violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. That court agreed, holding:~    ~    ~      18~      \" 'Those statements may be admissible in the investigation or prosecution of charges for which, at the time the recordings were made, adversary proceedings had not yet commenced. But as to the charges for which Moulton's right to counsel had already attached, his incriminating statements should have been ruled inadmissible at trial, given the circumstances in which they were acquired.' \" 474 U.S., at 168 (quoting State v. Moulton, 481 A. 2d 155, 161 (1984)).~    ~    ~      19~      We affirmed.~    ~    ~      20~      Respondent contends that, in affirming reversal of both the theft and burglary charges, the Moulton Court must have concluded that Moulton's Sixth Amendment right to counsel attached to the burglary charge. See Brief for Respondent 13-14; see also Brief for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. as Amici Curiae 22-23. But the Moulton Court did not address the question now before us, and to the extent Moulton spoke to the matter at all, it expressly referred to the offense-specific nature of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel:~    ~    ~      21~      \"The police have an interest in the thorough investigation of crimes for which formal charges have already been filed. They also have an interest in investigating new or additional crimes. Investigations of either type of crime may require surveillance of individuals already under indictment. Moreover, law enforcement officials investigating an individual suspected of committing one crime and formally charged with having committed another crime obviously seek to discover evidence useful at trial of either crime. In seeking evidence pertaining to pending charges, however, the Government's investigative powers are limited by the Sixth Amendment rights of the accused. ... On the other hand, to exclude evidence pertaining to charges as to which the Sixth Amendment right to counsel had not attached at the time the evidence was obtained, simply because other charges were pending at that time, would unnecessarily frustrate the public's interest in the investigation of criminal activities.\" 474 U.S., at 179-180 (emphasis added; footnote omitted).~    ~    ~      22~      See also id., at 168 (\"[T]he purpose of their meeting was to discuss the pending charges\"); id., at 177 (\"[T]he police knew ... that Moulton and [the informant] were meeting for the express purpose of discussing the pending charges ...\" (emphasis added)). Thus, respondent's reliance on Moulton is misplaced and, in light of the language employed there and subsequently in McNeil, puzzling.~    ~    ~      23~      Respondent predicts that the offense-specific rule will prove \"disastrous\" to suspects' constitutional rights and will \"permit law enforcement officers almost complete and total license to conduct unwanted and uncounseled interrogations.\" Brief for Respondent 8-9. Besides offering no evidence that such a parade of horribles has occurred in those jurisdictions that have not enlarged upon McNeil, he fails to appreciate the significance of two critical considerations. First, there can be no doubt that a suspect must be apprised of his rights against compulsory self-incrimination and to consult with an attorney before authorities may conduct custodial interrogation. See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S., at 479; Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428, 435 (2000) (quoting Miranda). In the present case, police scrupulously followed Miranda's dictates when questioning respondent.2 Second, it is critical to recognize that the Constitution does not negate society's interest in the ability of police to talk to witnesses and suspects, even those who have been charged with other offenses. \"Since the ready ability to obtain uncoerced confessions is not an evil but an unmitigated good, society would be the loser. Admissions of guilt resulting from valid Miranda waivers 'are more than merely \"desirable\"; they are essential to society's compelling interest in finding, convicting, and punishing those who violate the law.' \" McNeil, 501 U.S., at 181 (quoting Moran v. Burbine, 475 U.S. 412, 426 (1986)).~    ~    ~      24~      See also Moulton, supra, at 180 (\"[T]o exclude evidence pertaining to charges as to which the Sixth Amendment right to counsel had not attached at the time the evidence was obtained, simply because other charges were pending at the time, would unnecessarily frustrate the public's interest in the investigation of criminal activities\").~    ~    ~      25~      Although it is clear that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches only to charged offenses, we have recognized in other contexts that the definition of an \"offense\" is not necessarily limited to the four corners of a charging instrument. In Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 (1932), we explained that \"where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\" Id., at 304. We have since applied the Blockburger test to delineate the scope of the Fifth Amendment's Double Jeopardy Clause, which prevents multiple or successive prosecutions for the \"same offence.\" See, e.g., Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161, 164-166 (1977). We see no constitutional difference between the meaning of the term \"offense\" in the contexts of double jeopardy and of the right to counsel. Accordingly, we hold that when the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches, it does encompass offenses that, even if not formally charged, would be considered the same offense under the Blockburger test.3~    ~    ~      26~      While simultaneously conceding that its own test \"lacks the precision for which police officers may hope,\" post, at 10, the dissent suggests that adopting Blockburger's definition of \"offense\" will prove difficult to administer. But it is the dissent's vague iterations of the \" 'closely related to' \" or \" 'inextricably intertwined with' \" test, post, at 10, that would defy simple application. The dissent seems to presuppose that officers will possess complete knowledge of the circumstances surrounding an incident, such that the officers will be able to tailor their investigation to avoid addressing factually related offenses. Such an assumption, however, ignores the reality that police often are not yet aware of the exact sequence and scope of events they are investigating-indeed, that is why police must investigate in the first place. Deterred by the possibility of violating the Sixth Amendment, police likely would refrain from questioning certain defendants altogether.~    ~    ~      27~      It remains only to apply these principles to the facts at hand. At the time he confessed to Odessa police, respondent had been indicted for burglary of the Owings residence, but he had not been charged in the murders of Margaret and Kori Rae. As defined by Texas law, burglary and capital murder are not the same offense under Blockburger. Compare Texas Penal Code Ann. 30.02(a) (1994) (requiring entry into or continued concealment in a habitation or building) with 19.03(a)(7)(A) (requiring murder of more than one person during a single criminal transaction). Accordingly, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel did not bar police from interrogating respondent regarding the murders, and respondent's confession was therefore admissible.~    ~    ~      28~      The judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas is reversed.~    ~    It is so ordered. NOTES:~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         See, e.g., United States v. Covarrubias, 179 F.3d 1219, 1223-1224 (CA9 1999); United States v. Melgar, 139 F.3d 1005, 1013 (CA4 1998); United States v. Doherty, 126 F.3d 769, 776 (CA6 1997); United States v. Arnold, 106 F.3d 37, 41 (CA3 1997); United States v. Williams, 993 F.2d 451, 457 (CA5 1993); Commonwealth v. Rainwater, 425 Mass. 540, 556, 681 N. E. 2d 1218, 1229 (1997); In re Pack, 616 A. 2d 1006, 1010-1011 (Pa. Super. 1992).~      ~      ~        2~         Curiously, while predicting disastrous consequences for the core values underlying the Sixth Amendment, see post, at 3-7 (opinion of Breyer, J.), the dissenters give short shrift to the Fifth Amendment's role (as expressed in Miranda and Dickerson) in protecting a defendant's right to consult with counsel before talking to police. Even though the Sixth Amendment right to counsel has not attached to uncharged offenses, defendants retain the ability under Miranda to refuse any police questioning, and, indeed, charged defendants presumably have met with counsel and have had the opportunity to discuss whether it is advisable to invoke those Fifth Amendment rights. Thus, in all but the rarest of cases, the Court's decision today will have no impact whatsoever upon a defendant's ability to protect his Sixth Amendment right.~        It is also worth noting that, contrary to the dissent's suggestion, see post, at 1-2, 3, there is no \"background principle\" of our Sixth Amendment jurisprudence establishing that there may be no contact between a defendant and police without counsel present. The dissent would expand the Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel in a criminal prosecution into a rule which \" 'exists to prevent lawyers from taking advantage of uncounseled laypersons and to preserve the integrity of the lawyer-client relationship.' \" Post, at 5 (quoting ABA Ann. Model Rule of Profesional Conduct 4.2 (4th ed. 1999)). Every profession is competent to define the standards of conduct for its members, but such standards are obviously not controlling in interpretation of constitutional provisions. The Sixth Amendment right to counsel is personal to the defendant and specific to the offense.~      ~      ~        3~          In this sense, we could just as easily describe the Sixth Amendment as \"prosecution specific,\" insofar as it prevents discussion of charged offenses as well as offenses that, under Blockburger, could not be the subject of a later prosecution. And, indeed, the text of the Sixth Amendment confines its scope to \"all criminal prosecutions.\"~      ~    ~    Kennedy, J., concurring~    ~      29~      Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas join, concurring.~    ~    ~      30~      The Court's opinion is altogether sufficient to explain why the decision of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals should be reversed for failure to recognize the offense-specific nature of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. It seems advisable, however, to observe that the Court has reached its conclusion without the necessity to reaffirm or give approval to the decision in Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U.S. 625 (1986). This course is wise, in my view, for the underlying theory of Jackson seems questionable.~    ~    ~      31~      As the facts of the instant case well illustrate, it is difficult to understand the utility of a Sixth Amendment rule that operates to invalidate a confession given by the free choice of suspects who have received proper advice of their Miranda rights but waived them nonetheless. The Miranda rule, and the related preventative rule of Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477 (1981), serve to protect a suspect's voluntary choice not to speak outside his lawyer's presence. The parallel rule announced in Jackson, however, supersedes the suspect's voluntary choice to speak with investigators. After Jackson had been decided, the Court made the following observation with respect to Edwards:~    ~    ~      32~      \"Preserving the integrity of an accused's choice to communicate with police only through counsel is the essence of Edwards and its progeny-not barring an accused from making an initial election as to whether he will face the State's officers during questioning with the aid of counsel, or go it alone. If an accused 'knowingly and intelligently' pursues the latter course, we see no reason why the uncounseled statements he then makes must be excluded at his trial.\" Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U.S. 285, 291 (1988). There is little justification for not applying the same course of reasoning with equal force to the court-made preventative rule announced in Jackson; for Jackson, after all, was a wholesale importation of the Edwards rule into the Sixth Amendment.~    ~    ~      33~      In the instant case, Cobb at no time indicated to law enforcement authorities that he elected to remain silent about the double murder. By all indications, he made the voluntary choice to give his own account. Indeed, even now Cobb does not assert that he had no wish to speak at the time he confessed. While the Edwards rule operates to preserve the free choice of a suspect to remain silent, if Jackson were to apply it would override that choice.~    ~    ~      34~      There is further reason to doubt the wisdom of the Jackson holding. Neither Miranda nor Edwards enforces the Fifth Amendment right unless the suspect makes a clear and unambiguous assertion of the right to the presence of counsel during custodial interrogation. Davis v. United States, 512 U.S. 452, 459 (1994). Where a required Miranda warning has been given, a suspect's later confession, made outside counsel's presence, is suppressed to protect the Fifth Amendment right of silence only if a reasonable officer should have been certain that the suspect expressed the unequivocal election of the right.~    ~    ~      35~      The Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches quite without reference to the suspect's choice to speak with investigators after a Miranda warning. It is the commencement of a formal prosecution, indicated by the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings, that marks the beginning of the Sixth Amendment right. See ante, at 4 (quoting McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U.S. 171, 175 (1991)). These events may be quite independent of the suspect's election to remain silent, the interest which the Edwards rule serves to protect with respect to Miranda and the Fifth Amendment, and it thus makes little sense for a protective rule to attach absent such an election by the suspect. We ought to question the wisdom of a judge-made preventative rule to protect a suspect's desire not to speak when it cannot be shown that he had that intent.~    ~    ~      36~      Even if Jackson is to remain good law, its protections should apply only where a suspect has made a clear and unambiguous assertion of the right not to speak outside the presence of counsel, the same clear election required under Edwards. Cobb made no such assertion here, yet Justice Breyer's dissent rests upon the assumption that the Jackson rule should operate to exclude the confession no matter. There would be little justification for this extension of a rule that, even in a more limited application, rests on a doubtful rationale.~    ~    ~      37~      Justice Breyer defends Jackson by arguing that, once a suspect has accepted counsel at the commencement of adversarial proceedings, he should not be forced to confront the police during interrogation without the assistance of counsel. See post, at 3-5 (dissenting opinion). But the acceptance of counsel at an arraignment or similar proceeding only begs the question: acceptance of counsel for what? It is quite unremarkable that a suspect might want the assistance of an expert in the law to guide him through hearings and trial, and the attendant complex legal matters that might arise, but nonetheless might choose to give on his own a forthright account of the events that occurred. A court-made rule that prevents a suspect from even making this choice serves little purpose, especially given the regime of Miranda and Edwards.~    ~    ~      38~      With these further remarks, I join in full the opinion of the Court.~    ~    Breyer, J., dissenting~    ~      39~      Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.~    ~    ~      40~      This case focuses upon the meaning of a single word, \"offense,\" when it arises in the context of the Sixth Amendment. Several basic background principles define that context.~    ~    ~      41~      First, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel plays a central role in ensuring the fairness of criminal proceedings in our system of justice. See Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 344 (1963); Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 57 (1932).~    ~    ~      42~      Second, the right attaches when adversary proceedings, triggered by the government's formal accusation of a crime, begin. See Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. 387, 401 (1977); Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U.S. 682, 689 (1972); Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201, 206 (1964).~    ~    ~      43~      Third, once this right attaches, law enforcement officials are required, in most circumstances, to deal with the defendant through counsel rather than directly, even if the defendant has waived his Fifth Amendment rights. See Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U.S. 625, 633, 636 (1986) (waiver of right to presence of counsel is assumed invalid unless accused initiates communication); Maine v. Moulton, 474 U.S. 159, 176 (1985) (Sixth Amendment gives defendant right \"to rely on counsel as a 'medium' between him and the State\"). Cf. ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct 4.2 (2001) (lawyer is generally prohibited from communicating with a person known to be represented by counsel \"about the subject of the representation\" without counsel's \"consent\"); Green, A Prosecutor's Communications with Defendants: What Are the Limits?, 24 Crim. L. Bull. 283, 284, and n. 5 (1988) (version of Model Rule 4.2 or its predecessor has been adopted by all 50 States).~    ~    ~      44~      Fourth, the particular aspect of the right here at issue-the rule that the police ordinarily must communicate with the defendant through counsel-has important limits. In particular, recognizing the need for law enforcement officials to investigate \"new or additional crimes\" not the subject of current proceedings, Maine v. Moulton, supra, at 179, this Court has made clear that the right to counsel does not attach to any and every crime that an accused may commit or have committed, see McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U.S. 171, 175-176 (1991). The right \"cannot be invoked once for all future prosecutions,\" and it does not forbid \"interrogation unrelated to the charge.\" Id., at 175, 178. In a word, as this Court previously noted, the right is \"offense specific.\" Id., at 175.~    ~    ~      45~      This case focuses upon the last-mentioned principle, in particular upon the meaning of the words \"offense specific.\" These words appear in this Court's Sixth Amendment case law, not in the Sixth Amendment's text. See U.S. Const., Amdt. 6 (guaranteeing right to counsel \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions\"). The definition of these words is not self-evident. Sometimes the term \"offense\" may refer to words that are written in a criminal statute; sometimes it may refer generally to a course of conduct in the world, aspects of which constitute the elements of one or more crimes; and sometimes it may refer, narrowly and technically, just to the conceptually severable aspects of the latter. This case requires us to determine whether an \"offense\"-for Sixth Amendment purposes-includes factually related aspects of a single course of conduct other than those few acts that make up the essential elements of the crime charged.~    ~    ~      46~      We should answer this question in light of the Sixth Amendment's basic objectives as set forth in this Court's case law. At the very least, we should answer it in a way that does not undermine those objectives. But the Court today decides that \"offense\" means the crime set forth within \"the four corners of a charging instrument,\" along with other crimes that \"would be considered the same offense\" under the test established by Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 (1932). Ante, at 9. In my view, this unnecessarily technical definition undermines Sixth Amendment protections while doing nothing to further effective law enforcement.~    ~    ~      47~      For one thing, the majority's rule, while leaving the Fifth Amendment's protections in place, threatens to diminish severely the additional protection that, under this Court's rulings, the Sixth Amendment provides when it grants the right to counsel to defendants who have been charged with a crime and insists that law enforcement officers thereafter communicate with them through that counsel. See, e.g., Michigan v. Jackson, supra, at 632 (Sixth Amendment prevents police from questioning represented defendant through informants even when Fifth Amendment would not); Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 300, n. 4 (1980) (Fifth Amendment right, unlike Sixth, applies only in custodial interrogation).~    ~    ~      48~      Justice Kennedy, Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas, if not the majority, apparently believe these protections constitutionally unimportant, for, in their view, \"the underlying theory of Jackson seems questionable.\" Ante, at 1 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Both the majority and concurring opinions suggest that a suspect's ability to invoke his Fifth Amendment right and \"refuse any police questioning\" offers that suspect adequate constitutional protection. Ante, at 8, n. 2 (majority opinion); see also ante, at 2-3 (Kennedy, J., concurring). But that is not so.~    ~    ~      49~      Jackson focuses upon a suspect-perhaps a frightened or uneducated suspect-who, hesitant to rely upon his own unaided judgment in his dealings with the police, has invoked his constitutional right to legal assistance in such matters. See Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U.S., at 634, n. 7 (\" 'The simple fact that [a] defendant has requested an attorney indicates that he does not believe that he is sufficiently capable of dealing with his adversaries singlehandedly' \") (quoting People v. Bladel, 421 Mich. 39, 63-64, 365 N. W. 2d 56, 67 (1984)). Jackson says that, once such a request has been made, the police may not simply throw that suspect-who does not trust his own unaided judgment-back upon his own devices by requiring him to rely for protection upon that same unaided judgment that he previously rejected as inadequate. In a word, the police may not force a suspect who has asked for legal counsel to make a critical legal choice without the legal assistance that he has requested and that the Constitution guarantees. See McNeil v. Wisconsin, supra, at 177 (\"The purpose of the Sixth Amendment counsel guarantee ... is to 'protec[t] the unaided layman at critical confrontations' with his 'expert adversary' \") (quoting United States v. Gouveia, 467 U.S. 180, 189 (1984)). The Constitution does not take away with one hand what it gives with the other. See Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S., at 344 (Sixth Amendment means that a person charged with a crime need not \"face his accusers without a lawyer to assist him\"); Michigan v. Jackson, supra, at 633, 635 (presuming \"that the defendant requests the lawyer's services at every critical stage of the prosecution\" even if the defendant fails to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights at the time of interrogation); cf. Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477, 484-485 (1981) (when accused has expressed desire to deal with police through counsel, police may not reinitiate interrogation until counsel has been made available); ABA Ann. Model Rule of Professional Conduct 4.2, p. 398, comment. (4th ed. 1999) (\"Rule 4.2 ... exists to prevent lawyers from taking advantage of uncounseled laypersons and to preserve the integrity of the lawyer-client relationship\").~    ~    ~      50~      For these reasons, the Sixth Amendment right at issue is independent of the Fifth Amendment's protections; and the importance of this Sixth Amendment right has been repeatedly recognized in our cases. See, e.g., Michigan v. Jackson, supra, at 636 (\"We conclude that the assertion [of the right to counsel] is no less significant, and the need for additional safeguards no less clear, when the request for counsel is made at an arraignment and when the basis for the claim is the Sixth Amendment\").~    ~    ~      51~      Justice Kennedy primarily relies upon Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U.S. 285 (1988), in support of his conclusion that Jackson is not good law. He quotes Patterson's statement that the Constitution does \" 'not ba[r] an accused from making an initial election as to whether' \" to speak with the police without counsel's assistance. Ante, at 1-2 (quoting Patterson v. Illinois, supra, at 291).~    ~    ~      52~      This statement, however, cannot justify the overruling of Jackson. That is because, in Patterson itself, this Court noted, \"as a matter of some significance,\" that, at the time he was interrogated, the defendant had neither retained nor accepted the appointment of counsel. 487 U.S., at 290, n. 3. We characterized our holding in Jackson as having depended upon \"the fact that the accused 'ha[d] asked for the help of a lawyer' in dealing with the police,\" 487 U.S., at 291 (quoting Michigan v. Jackson, supra, at 631), and explained that, \"[o]nce an accused has a lawyer, a distinct set of constitutional safeguards aimed at preserving the sanctity of the attorney-client relationship takes effect,\" 487 U.S., at 290, n. 3 (citing Maine v. Moulton, 474 U.S., at 176).~    ~    ~      53~      Justice Kennedy also criticizes Jackson on the ground that it prevents a suspect \"from ... making th[e] choice\" to \"give ... a forthright account of the events that occurred.\" Ante, at 3. But that is not so. A suspect may initiate communication with the police, thereby avoiding the risk that the police induced him to make, unaided, the kind of critical legal decision best made with the help of counsel, whom he has requested.~    ~    ~      54~      Unlike Justice Kennedy, the majority does not call Jackson itself into question. But the majority would undermine that case by significantly diminishing the Sixth Amendment protections that the case provides. That is because criminal codes are lengthy and highly detailed, often proliferating \"overlapping and related statutory offenses\" to the point where prosecutors can easily \"spin out a startlingly numerous series of offenses from a single ... criminal transaction.\" Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 445, n. 10 (1970). Thus, an armed robber who reaches across a store counter, grabs the cashier, and demands \"your money or your life,\" may through that single instance of conduct have committed several \"offenses,\" in the majority's sense of the term, including armed robbery, assault, battery, trespass, use of a firearm to commit a felony, and perhaps possession of a firearm by a felon, as well. A person who is using and selling drugs on a single occasion might be guilty of possessing various drugs, conspiring to sell drugs, being under the influence of illegal drugs, possessing drug paraphernalia, possessing a gun in relation to the drug sale, and, depending upon circumstances, violating various gun laws as well. A protester blocking an entrance to a federal building might also be trespassing, failing to disperse, unlawfully assembling, and obstructing Government administration all at one and the same time.~    ~    ~      55~      The majority's rule permits law enforcement officials to question those charged with a crime without first approaching counsel, through the simple device of asking questions about any other related crime not actually charged in the indictment. Thus, the police could ask the individual charged with robbery about, say, the assault of the cashier not yet charged, or about any other uncharged offense (unless under Blockburger's definition it counts as the \"same crime\"), all without notifying counsel. Indeed, the majority's rule would permit law enforcement officials to question anyone charged with any crime in any one of the examples just given about his or her conduct on the single relevant occasion without notifying counsel unless the prosecutor has charged every possible crime arising out of that same brief course of conduct. What Sixth Amendment sense-what common sense-does such a rule make? What is left of the \"communicate through counsel\" rule? The majority's approach is inconsistent with any common understanding of the scope of counsel's representation. It will undermine the lawyer's role as \" 'medium' \" between the defendant and the government. Maine v. Moulton, supra, at 176. And it will, on a random basis, remove a significant portion of the protection that this Court has found inherent in the Sixth Amendment.~    ~    ~      56~      In fact, under the rule today announced by the majority, two of the seminal cases in our Sixth Amendment jurisprudence would have come out differently. In Maine v. Moulton, which the majority points out \"expressly referred to the offense-specific nature of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel,\" ante, at 7, we treated burglary and theft as the same offense for Sixth Amendment purposes. Despite the opinion's clear statement that \"[i]ncriminating statements pertaining to other crimes, as to which the Sixth Amendment right has not yet attached, are, of course, admissible at a trial of those offenses,\" 474 U.S., at 180, n. 16, the Court affirmed the lower court's reversal of both burglary and theft charges even though, at the time that the incriminating statements at issue were made, Moulton had been charged only with theft by receiving, id., at 162, 167, 180. Under the majority's rule, in contrast, because theft by receiving and burglary each required proof of a fact that the other did not, only Moulton's theft convictions should have been overturned. Compare Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17-A, 359 (1981) (theft) (requiring knowing receipt, retention, or disposal of stolen property with the intent to deprive the owner thereof), with 401 (burglary) (requiring entry of a structure without permission and with the intent to commit a crime).~    ~    ~      57~      In Brewer v. Williams, the effect of the majority's rule would have been even more dramatic. Because first-degree murder and child abduction each required proof of a fact not required by the other, and because at the time of the impermissible interrogation Williams had been charged only with abduction of a child, Williams' murder conviction should have remained undisturbed. See 430 U.S., at 390, 393-395, 406. Compare Iowa Code 690.2 (1950 and Supp. 1978) (first-degree murder) (requiring a killing) with Iowa Code 706.2 (1950) (repealed 1978) (child-stealing) (requiring proof that a child under 16 was taken with the intent to conceal the child from his or her parent or guardian). This is not to suggest that this Court has previously addressed and decided the question presented by this case. Rather, it is to point out that the Court's conception of the Sixth Amendment right at the time that Moulton and Brewer were decided naturally presumed that it extended to factually related but uncharged offenses.~    ~    ~      58~      At the same time, the majority's rule threatens the legal clarity necessary for effective law enforcement. That is because the majority, aware that the word \"offense\" ought to encompass something beyond \"the four corners of the charging instrument,\" imports into Sixth Amendment law the definition of \"offense\" set forth in Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 (1932), a case interpreting the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which Clause uses the word \"offence\" but otherwise has no relevance here. Whatever Fifth Amendment virtues Blockburger may have, to import it into this Sixth Amendment context will work havoc.~    ~    ~      59~      In theory, the test says that two offenses are the \"same offense\" unless each requires proof of a fact that the other does not. See ante, at 9 (majority opinion). That means that most of the different crimes mentioned above are not the \"same offense.\" Under many States' laws, for example, the statute defining assault and the statute defining robbery each requires proof of a fact that the other does not. Compare, e.g., Cal. Penal Code Ann. 211 (West 1999) (robbery) (requiring taking of personal property of another) with 240 (assault) (requiring attempt to commit violent injury). Hence the extension of the definition of \"offense\" that is accomplished by the use of the Blockburger test does nothing to address the substantial concerns about the circumvention of the Sixth Amendment right that are raised by the majority's rule.~    ~    ~      60~      But, more to the point, the simple-sounding Blockburger test has proved extraordinarily difficult to administer in practice. Judges, lawyers, and law professors often disagree about how to apply it. See, e.g., United States v. Woodward, 469 U.S. 105, 108 (1985) (per curiam) (holding that lower court misapplied Blockburger test). Compare United States v. Dixon, 509 U.S. 688, 697-700 (1993) (opinion of Scalia, J.) (applying Blockburger and concluding that contempt is same offense as underlying substantive crime), with 509 U.S., at 716-720 (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (applying Blockburger and deciding that the two are separate offenses). The test has emerged as a tool in an area of our jurisprudence that The Chief Justice has described as \"a veritable Sargasso Sea which could not fail to challenge the most intrepid judicial navigator.\" Albernaz v. United States, 450 U.S. 333, 343 (1981). Yet the Court now asks, not the lawyers and judges who ordinarily work with double jeopardy law, but police officers in the field, to navigate Blockburger when they question suspects. Cf. New York v. Belton, 453 U.S. 454, 458 (1981) (noting importance of clear rules to guide police behavior). Some will apply the test successfully; some will not. Legal challenges are inevitable. The result, I believe, will resemble not so much the Sargasso Sea as the criminal law equivalent of Milton's \"Serbonian Bog ... Where Armies whole have sunk.\"~    ~    ~      61~      There is, of course, an alternative. We can, and should, define \"offense\" in terms of the conduct that constitutes the crime that the offender committed on a particular occasion, including criminal acts that are \"closely related to\" or \"inextricably intertwined with\" the particular crime set forth in the charging instrument. This alternative is not perfect. The language used lacks the precision for which police officers may hope; and it requires lower courts to specify its meaning further as they apply it in individual cases. Yet virtually every lower court in the United States to consider the issue has defined \"offense\" in the Sixth Amendment context to encompass such closely related acts. See ante, at 5, n. 1 (majority opinion) (citing cases from the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Ninth Circuits as well as state courts in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania); Taylor v. State, 726 So. 2d 841, 845 (Fla. Ct. App. 1999); People v. Clankie, 124 Ill. 2d 456, 462-466, 530 N. E. 2d 448, 451-453 (1988); State v. Tucker, 137 N. J. 259, 277- 278, 645 A. 2d 111, 120-121 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1090 (1995). These courts have found offenses \"closely related\" where they involved the same victim, set of acts, evidence, or motivation. See, e.g., Taylor v. State, supra, at 845 (stolen property charges and burglary); State v. Tucker, supra, at 278, 645 A. 2d, at 121 (burglary, robbery, and murder of home's occupant); In re Pack, 420 Pa. Super. 347, 355-356, 616 A. 2d 1006, 1010 (1992) (burglary, receiving stolen property, and theft charges), appeal denied, 535 Pa. 669, 634 A. 2d 1117 (1993). They have found offenses unrelated where time, location, or factual circumstances significantly separated the one from the other. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Rainwater, 425 Mass. 540, 547-549, and n. 7, 681 N. E. 2d 1218, 1224, and n. 7 (1997) (vehicle theft charge and earlier vehicle thefts in same area), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1095 (1998); Whittlesey v. State, 340 Md. 30, 56- 57, 665 A. 2d 223, 236 (1995) (murder and making false statements charges), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1148 (1996); People v. Dotson, 214 Ill. App. 3d 637, 646, 574 N. E. 2d 143, 149 (murder and weapons charges), appeal denied, 141 Ill. 2d 549, 580 N. E. 2d 123 (1991).~    ~    ~      62~      One cannot say in favor of this commonly followed approach that it is perfectly clear-only that, because it comports with common sense, it is far easier to apply than that of the majority. One might add that, unlike the majority's test, it is consistent with this Court's assumptions in previous cases. See Maine v. Moulton, 474 U.S., at 162, 167, 180 (affirming reversal of both burglary and theft convictions); Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S., at 389, 390, 393, 406 (affirming grant of habeas which vacated murder conviction). And, most importantly, the \"closely related\" test furthers, rather than undermines, the Sixth Amendment's \"right to counsel,\" a right so necessary to the realization in practice of that most \"noble ideal,\" a fair trial. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S., at 344.~    ~    ~      63~      The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, following this commonly accepted approach, found that the charged burglary and the uncharged murders were \"closely related.\" All occurred during a short period of time on the same day in the same basic location. The victims of the murders were also victims of the burglary. Cobb committed one of the murders in furtherance of the robbery, the other to cover up the crimes. The police, when questioning Cobb, knew that he already had a lawyer representing him on the burglary charges and had demonstrated their belief that this lawyer also represented Cobb in respect to the murders by asking his permission to question Cobb about the murders on previous occasions. The relatedness of the crimes is well illustrated by the impossibility of questioning Cobb about the murders without eliciting admissions about the burglary. See, e.g., Tr. 157 (Feb. 19, 1997) (testimony by police officer who obtained murder confession) (\"Basically what he told us is he had gone over to the house to burglarize it and nobody was home\"); 22 Record, State's Exh. 20 (typed statement by Cobb) (admitting that he committed the murders after entering the house and stealing stereo parts). Nor, in my view, did Cobb waive his right to counsel. See supra, at 4-5. These considerations are sufficient. The police officers ought to have spoken to Cobb's counsel before questioning Cobb. I would affirm the decision of the Texas court.~    ~    ~      64~      Consequently, I dissent.~    ~    ",

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.ARTHUR S. LUJAN, LABOR COMMISSIONER OF CALIFORNIA, et al., PETITIONERSv.G  G FIRE SPRINKLERS, INC.~    No. 00-152.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued February 26, 2001~    Decided April 17, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      The California Labor Code (Code) authorizes the State to order withholding of payments due a contractor on a public works project if a subcontractor on the project fails to comply with certain Code requirements; permits the contractor, in turn, to withhold similar sums from the subcontractor; and permits the contractor, or his assignee, to sue the awarding body for alleged breach of the contract in not making payment to recover the wages or penalties withheld. After petitioner State Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE) determined that respondent G  G Fire Sprinklers, Inc. (G  G), as a subcontractor on three public works projects, had violated the Code, it issued notices directing the awarding bodies on those projects to withhold from the contractors an amount equal to the wages and penalties forfeited due to G  G's violations. The awarding bodies withheld payment from the contractors, who in turn withheld G  G's payment. G  G filed a 42 U.S.C.  1983 suit against DLSE and other state petitioners in the District Court, claiming that the issuance of the notices without a hearing deprived it of property without due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court granted G  G summary judgment, declared the relevant Code sections unconstitutional, and enjoined the State from enforcing the provisions against G  G. The Ninth Circuit affirmed. This Court granted certiorari, vacated that judgment, and remanded for reconsideration in light of its decision in American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, 526 U.S. 40, that the respondents there had no property interest in payment for disputed medical treatment pending review of the treatment's reasonableness and necessity, as authorized by state law. On remand, the Ninth Circuit reinstated its prior judgment and opinion, explaining that G  G's rights were violated not because it was deprived of immediate payment, but because the state statutory scheme afforded no hearing at all.~      Held: Because state law affords G  G sufficient opportunity to pursue its claim for payment under its contracts in state court, the statutory scheme does not deprive it of due process. In each of this Court's cases relied upon by the Ninth Circuit, the claimant was denied a right by virtue of which he was presently entitled either to exercise ownership dominion over real or personal property, or to pursue a gainful occupation. See, e.g., United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, 510 U.S. 43, 62. Unlike those claimants, G  G has not been deprived of any present entitlement. It has been deprived of payment that it contends it is owed under a contract, based on the State's determination that it failed to comply with the contract's terms. That property interest can be fully protected by an ordinary breach-of-contract suit. If California makes ordinary judicial process available to G  G for resolving its contractual dispute, that process is due process. Here, the Code, by allowing a contractor to assign the right of suit, provides a means by which a subcontractor may bring a breach-of-contract suit to recover withheld payments. That damages may not be awarded until the suit's conclusion does not deprive G  G of its claim. Even if G  G could not obtain assignment, it appears that a breach-of-contract suit against the contractor remains available under state common law, although final determination of the question rests in the hands of the California courts. Pp. 5-9.~      204 F.3d 941, reversed.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT~      Rehnquist, C. J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.~      Opinion of the Court~      Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      The California Labor Code (Code or Labor Code) autho-rizes the State to order withholding of payments due a contractor on a public works project if a subcontractor on the project fails to comply with certain Code requirements. The Code permits the contractor, in turn, to withhold similar sums from the subcontractor. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the relevant Code provisions violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the statutory scheme does not afford the subcontractor a hearing before or after such action is taken. We granted certiorari, 531 U.S. 924 (2000), and we reverse.~    ~    ~      2~      Petitioners are the California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE), the California Department of Industrial Relations, and several state officials in their official capacities. Respondent G  G Fire Sprinklers, Inc. (G  G) is a fire-protection company that installs fire sprinkler systems. G  G served as a subcontractor on several California public works projects. \"Public works\" include construction work done under contract and paid for in whole or part by public funds. Cal. Lab. Code Ann. 1720 (West Supp. 2001). The department, board, authority, officer, or agent awarding a contract for public work is called the \"awarding body.\" 1722 (West 1989). The California Labor Code requires that contractors and subcontractors on such projects pay their workers a prevailing wage that is determined by the State. 1771, 1772, 1773 (West 1989 and Supp. 2001). At the time relevant here, if workers were not paid the prevailing wage, the contractor was required to pay each worker the difference between the prevailing wage and the wages paid, in addition to forfeiting a penalty to the State. 1775 (West Supp. 2001).1 The awarding body was required to include a clause in the contract so stipulating. Ibid.~    ~    ~      3~      The Labor Code provides that \"[b]efore making payments to the contractor of money due under a contract for public work, the awarding body shall withhold and retain therefrom all wages and penalties which have been forfeited pursuant to any stipulation in a contract for public work, and the terms of this chapter.\" 1727 (West Supp. 2001). If money is withheld from a contractor because of a subcontractor's failure to comply with the Code's provisions, \"[i]t shall be lawful for [the] contractor to withhold from [the] subcontractor under him sufficient sums to cover any penalties withheld.\" 1729 (West 1989).2~    ~    ~      4~      The Labor Code permits the contractor, or his assignee, to bring suit against the awarding body \"on the contract for alleged breach thereof in not making ... payment\" to recover the wages or penalties withheld. 1731, 1732 (West Supp. 2001). The suit must be brought within 90 days of completion of the contract and acceptance of the job. 1730. Such a suit \"is the exclusive remedy of the contractor or his or her assignees.\" 1732. The awarding body retains the wages and penalties \"pending the outcome of the suit.\" 1731.3~    ~    ~      5~      In 1995, DLSE determined that G  G, as a subcontractor on three public works projects, had violated the Labor Code by failing to pay the prevailing wage and failing to keep and/or furnish payroll records upon request. DLSE issued notices to the awarding bodies on those projects, directing them to withhold from the contractors an amount equal to the wages and penalties forfeited due to G  G's violations. The awarding bodies withheld payment from the contractors, who in turn withheld payment from G  G. The total withheld, according to respondent, exceeded $135,000. App. 68.~    ~    ~      6~      G  G sued petitioners in the District Court for the Central District of California. G  G sought declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to Rev. Stat. 1979, 42 U.S.C.  1983 claiming that the issuance of withholding notices without a hearing constituted a deprivation of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court granted respondent's motion for summary judgment, declared 1727, 1730-1733, 1775, 1776(g), and 1813 of the Labor Code unconstitutional, and enjoined the State from enforcing these provisions against respondent. App. to Pet. for Cert. A85-A87. Petitioners appealed.~    ~    ~      7~      A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. G  G Fire Sprinklers, Inc. v. Bradshaw, 156 F.3d 893, 898 (CA9 1998) (Bradshaw I). The court concluded that G  G \"has a property interest in being paid in full for the construction work it has completed,\" id., at 901, and found that G  G was deprived of that interest \"as a result of the state's action,\" id., at 903. It decided that because subcontractors were \"afforded neither a pre- nor post-deprivation hearing when payments [were] withheld,\" the statutory scheme violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Id., at 904.~    ~    ~      8~      Following Bradshaw I, we decided American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, 526 U.S. 40 (1999), where respondents also alleged a deprivation of property without due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Sullivan involved a challenge to a private insurer's decision to withhold payment for disputed medical treatment pending review of its reasonableness and necessity, as authorized by state law. We held that the insurer's action was not \"fairly attributable to the State,\" and that respondents therefore failed to satisfy a critical element of their 1983 claim. Id., at 58. We also decided that because state law entitled respondents to reasonable and necessary medical treatment, respondents had no property interest in payment for medical treatment not yet deemed to meet those criteria. Id., at 61. We granted certiorari in Bradshaw I, vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remanded for reconsideration in light of Sullivan. Bradshaw v. G  G Fire Sprinklers, Inc., 526 U.S. 1061 (1999).~    ~    ~      9~      On remand, the Court of Appeals reinstated its prior judgment and opinion, again by a divided vote. The court held that the withholding of payments was state action because it was \"specifically directed by State officials ... [and] the withholding party has no discretion.\" G  G Fire Sprinklers, Inc. v. Bradshaw, 204 F.3d 941, 944 (CA9 2000). In its view, its prior opinion was consistent with Sullivan because it \"specifically held that G  G did not have a right to payment of the disputed funds pending the outcome of whatever kind of hearing would be afforded,\" and \"explicitly authorized the withholding of payments pending the hearing.\" 204 F.3d, at 943. The court explained that G  G's rights were violated not because it was deprived of immediate payment, but \"because the California statutory scheme afforded no hearing at all when state officials directed that payments be withheld.\" Id., at 943-944.~    ~    ~      10~      Where a state law such as this is challenged on due process grounds, we inquire whether the State has deprived the claimant of a protected property interest, and whether the State's procedures comport with due process. Sullivan, supra, at 59. We assume, without deciding, that the withholding of money due respondent under its contracts occurred under color of state law, and that, as the Court of Appeals concluded, respondent has a property interest of the kind we considered in Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422 (1982), in its claim for payment under its contracts. 204 F.3d, at 943-944. Because we believe that California law affords respondent sufficient opportunity to pursue that claim in state court, we conclude that the California statutory scheme does not deprive G  G of its claim for payment without due process of law. See Logan, supra, at 433 (\"[T]he Due Process Clause grants the aggrieved party the opportunity to present his case and have its merits fairly judged\").~    ~    ~      11~      The Court of Appeals relied upon several of our cases dealing with claims of deprivation of a property interest without due process to hold that G  G was entitled to a reasonably prompt hearing when payments were withheld. Bradshaw I, supra, at 903-904 (citing United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, 510 U.S. 43 (1993); FDIC v. Mallen, 486 U.S. 230 (1988); Barry v. Barchi, 443 U.S. 55 (1979)). In Good, we held that the Government must afford the owner of a house subject to forfeiture as property used to commit or to facilitate commission of a federal drug offense notice and a hearing before seizing the property. 510 U.S., at 62. In Barchi, we held that a racetrack trainer suspended for 15 days on suspicion of horse drugging was entitled to a prompt postdeprivation administrative or judicial hearing. 443 U.S., at 63-64. And in Mallen, we held that the president of a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured bank suspended from office by the FDIC was accorded due process by a notice and hearing procedure which would render a decision within 90 days of the suspension. 486 U.S., at 241-243. See also Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp. of Bay View, 395 U.S. 337 (1969) (holding that due process requires notice and a hearing before wages may be garnished).~    ~    ~      12~      In each of these cases, the claimant was denied a right by virtue of which he was presently entitled either to exercise ownership dominion over real or personal property, or to pursue a gainful occupation. Unlike those claimants, respondent has not been denied any present entitlement. G  G has been deprived of payment that it contends it is owed under a contract, based on the State's determination that G  G failed to comply with the contract's terms. G  G has only a claim that it did comply with those terms and therefore that it is entitled to be paid in full. Though we assume for purposes of decision here that G  G has a property interest in its claim for payment, see supra, at 5-6, it is an interest, unlike the interests discussed above, that can be fully protected by an ordinary breach-of-contract suit.~    ~    ~      13~      In Cafeteria  Restaurant Workers v. McElroy, 367 U.S. 886, 895 (1961) (citations omitted), we said:~    ~    ~      14~      \"The very nature of due process negates any concept of inflexible procedures universally applicable to every imaginable situation. ' \"[D]ue process,\" unlike some legal rules, is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances.' It is 'compounded of history, reason, the past course of decisions ... .' \"~    ~    ~      15~      We hold that if California makes ordinary judicial process available to respondent for resolving its contractual dispute, that process is due process.~    ~    ~      16~      The California Labor Code provides that \"the contractor or his or her assignee\" may sue the awarding body \"on the contract for alleged breach thereof\" for \"the recovery of wages or penalties.\" 1731, 1732 (West Supp. 2001). There is no basis here to conclude that the contractor would refuse to assign the right of suit to its subcontractor. In fact, respondent stated at oral argument that it has sued awarding bodies in state superior court pursuant to 1731-1733 of the Labor Code to recover payments withheld on previous projects where it served as a subcontractor. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 27, 40-41, 49-50. Presumably, respondent brought suit as an assignee of the contractors on those projects, as the Code requires. 1732 (West Supp. 2001). Thus, the Labor Code, by allowing assignment, provides a means by which a subcontractor may bring a claim for breach of contract to recover wages and penalties withheld.~    ~    ~      17~      Respondent complains that a suit under the Labor Code is inadequate because the awarding body retains the wages and penalties \"pending the outcome of the suit,\" 1731, which may last several years. Tr. of Oral Arg. 51. A lawsuit of that duration, while undoubtedly something of a hardship, cannot be said to deprive respondent of its claim for payment under the contract. Lawsuits are not known for expeditiously resolving claims, and the standard practice in breach-of-contract suits is to award damages, if appropriate, only at the conclusion of the case.~    ~    ~      18~      Even if respondent could not obtain assignment of the right to sue the awarding body under the contract, it appears that a suit for breach of contract against the contractor remains available under California common law. See 1 B. Witkin, Summary of California Law 791, 797 (9th ed. 1987) (defining breach as the \"unjustified or unexcused failure to perform a contract\" and describing the remedies available under state law). To be sure, 1732 of the Labor Code provides that suit on the contract against the awarding body is the \"exclusive remedy of the contractor or his or her assignees\" with respect to recovery of withheld wages and penalties. 1732 (West Supp. 2001). But the remedy is exclusive only with respect to the contractor and his assignees, and thus by its terms not the exclusive remedy for a subcontractor who does not receive assignment. See, e.g., J  K Painting Co., Inc. v. Bradshaw, 45 Cal. App. 4th 1394, 1402, 53 Cal. Rptr. 2d 496, 501 (1996) (allowing subcontractor to challenge Labor Commissioner's action by petition for a writ of the mandate).~    ~    ~      19~      In J  K Painting, the California Court of Appeal rejected the argument that 1732 requires a subcontractor to obtain an assignment and that failure to do so is \"fatal to any other attempt to secure relief.\" Id., at 1401, n. 7, 53 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 501, n. 7. The Labor Code does not expressly impose such a requirement, and that court declined to infer an intent to \"create remedial exclusivity\" in this context. Ibid. It thus appears that subcontractors like respondent may pursue their claims for payment by bringing a standard breach-of-contract suit against the contractor under California law. Our view is necessarily tentative, since the final determination of the question rests in the hands of the California courts, but respondent has not convinced us that this avenue of relief is closed to it. See id., at 1401, and n. 4, 53 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 500, and n. 4 (noting that the contractor might assert a variety of defenses to the subcontractor's suit for breach of contract without evaluating their soundness). As the party challenging the statutory withholding scheme, respondent bears the burden of demonstrating its unconstitutionality. Cf. INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 944 (1983) (statutes presumed constitutional). We therefore conclude that the relevant provisions of the California Labor Code do not deprive respondent of property without due process of law. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.~    ~    ~      20~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         The Code also imposes restrictions on recordkeeping and working hours, and at the time relevant here, the contractor was similarly penalized if the contractor or subcontractor failed to comply with them. Cal. Lab. Code Ann. 1776(a), (b), (g) (West Supp. 2001), 1813 (West 1989). The awarding body was required to include a clause in the contract so stipulating. 1776(h), 1813. Sections 1775, 1776, and 1813 were subsequently amended to provide that both contractors and subcontractors may be penalized for failure to comply with the Labor Code. 1775(a), 1776(g), 1813 (West Supp. 2001). Amendments to 1775 also state that either the contractor or the subcontractor may pay workers the difference between the prevailing wage and wages paid. 1775(a).~      ~      ~        2~         Amendments to the Labor Code effective July 1, 2001, impose additional requirements on contractors. See 1727(b) (West Supp. 2001) (contractor shall withhold money from subcontractor at request of Labor Commissioner in certain circumstances); 1775(b)(3) (contractor shall take corrective action to halt subcontractor's failure to pay prevailing wages if aware of the failure or be subject to penalties).~      ~      ~        3~         Sections 1730-1733 of the Code have been repealed, effective July 1, 2001. Section 1742 has replaced them. It provides that \"[a]n affected contractor or subcontractor may obtain review of a civil wage and penalty assessment [under the Code] by transmitting a written request to the office of the Labor Commissioner.\" 1742(a). The contractor or subcontractor is then entitled to a hearing before the Director of Industrial Relations, who shall appoint an impartial hearing officer. Within 45 days of the hearing, the director shall issue a written decision affirming, modifying, or dismissing the assessment. A contractor or subcontractor may obtain review of the director's decision by filing a petition for a writ of the mandate in state superior court. 1742(b), (c). These provisions are not yet in effect and these procedures were not available to respondent at the time of the withholding of payments at issue here.~      ~    ~    ",

Readers are requested to notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D. C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.UNITED STATESv.CLEVELAND INDIANS BASEBALL CO.~    No. 00-203.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued February 27, 2001~    Decided April 17, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      Under a grievance settlement agreement, respondent Cleveland Indians Baseball Company (Company) owed 8 players backpay for wages due in 1986 and 14 players backpay for wages due in 1987. The Company paid the back wages in 1994. This case presents the question whether, under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), the back wages should be taxed by reference to the year they were actually paid (1994) or, instead, by reference to the years they should have been paid (1986 and 1987). Both tax rates and the amount of the wages subject to tax (the wage base) have risen over time. Consequently, allocating the 1994 payments back to 1986 and 1987 would generate no additional FICA or FUTA tax liability for the Company and its former employees, while treating the back wages as taxable in 1994 would subject both the Company and the employees to significant tax liability. The Company paid its share of employment taxes on the back wages according to 1994 tax rates and wage bases. After the Internal Revenue Service denied its claims for a refund of those payments, the Company initiated this action in District Court. The Company relied on Sixth Circuit precedent holding that a settlement for back wages should not be allocated to the period when the employer finally pays but to the periods when the wages were not paid as usual. The District Court, bound by that precedent, entered judgment for the Company and ordered the Government to refund FICA and FUTA taxes. The Sixth Circuit affirmed.~      Held: Back wages are subject to FICA and FUTA taxes by reference to the year the wages are in fact paid. Pp. 5-19.~      (a) The Internal Revenue Code imposes FICA and FUTA taxes \"on every employer ... equal to [a percentage of] wages ... paid by him with respect to employment.\" 26 U.S.C.  3111(a), 3111(b), 3301. The Social Security tax provision, 3111(a), prescribes tax rates applicable to \"wages paid during\" each year from 1984 onward. The Medicare tax provision, 3111(b)(6), sets the tax rate \"with respect to wages paid after December 31, 1985.\" And the FUTA tax provision, 3301, sets the rate as a percentage \"in the case of calendar years 1988 through 2007 ... of the total wages ... paid by [the employer] during the calendar year.\" Section 3121(a) establishes the annual ceiling on wages subject to Social Security tax by defining \"wages\" to exclude any remuneration \"paid to [an] individual by [an] employer during [a] calendar year\" that exceeds \"remuneration ... equal to the contribution and benefit base ... paid to [such] individual ... during the calendar year with respect to which such contribution and benefit base is effective.\" Section 3306(b)(1) similarly limits annual wages subject to FUTA tax. Pp. 5-6.~      (b) The Government calls attention to these provisions' constant references to wages paid during a calendar year as the touchstone for determining the applicable tax rate and wage base. The meaning of this language, the Government contends, is plain: Wages are taxed according to the calendar year they are in fact paid, regardless of when they should have been paid. The Court agrees with the Company that Social Security Bd. v. Nierotko, 327 U.S. 358, undermines the Government's plain language argument. The Nierotko Court concluded that, for purposes of determining a wrongfully discharged worker's eligibility for Social Security benefits under 209(g), as that provision was formulated in the 1939 Amendments to the Social Security Act, a backpay award had to be allocated as wages to calendar quarters of the year \"when the regular wages were not paid as usual.\" Id., at 370, and n. 25. The Court found no conflict between this allocation-back rule and language in 209(g) tying benefits eligibility to the number of calendar quarters \"in which\" a minimum amount of \"wages\" \"has been paid.\" Nierotko's allocation holding for benefits eligibility purposes, which the Government does not here urge the Court to overrule, thus turned on an implicit construction of 209(g)'s terms-\"wages\" \"paid\" \"in\" \"a calendar quarter\"-to include \"regular wages\" that should have been paid but \"were not paid as usual,\" 327 U.S., at 370. Given this construction, it cannot be said that the FICA and FUTA provisions prescribing tax rates based on wages paid during a calendar year have a plain meaning that precludes allocation of backpay to the year it should have been paid. Pp. 6-10.~      (c) However, the Court rejects the Company's contention that, because Nierotko read the 1939 \"wages paid\" language for benefits eligibility purposes to accommodate an allocation-back rule for backpay, the identical 1939 \"wages paid\" language for tax purposes must be read the same way. Nierotko dealt specifically and only with Social Security benefits eligibility, not with taxation. The Court's allocation holding in Nierotko in all likelihood reflected concern that the benefits scheme created in 1939 would be disserved by allowing an employer's wrongdoing to reduce the quarters of coverage an employee would otherwise be entitled to claim toward eligibility. No similar concern underlies the tax provisions. The legislative history demonstrates that the 1939 Amendments adopting the \"wages paid\" rule for taxation were designed to address Congress' worry that, as tax rates increased from year to year, administrative difficulties and confusion would attend the taxation of wages payable in one year, but not actually paid until another year.~      (d) The Court is not persuaded Congress incorporated Nierotko's treatment of backpay into the tax provisions when it amended the Social Security Act shortly after Nierotko was decided. Prior to 1946, the FICA and FUTA wage bases were defined in terms of remuneration paid with respect to employment during a given year. The 1946 law amended 209(a), which defines the Social Security wage base for purposes of benefits calculation, by adopting the \"wages paid\" language already present in 209(g), the provision construed in Nierotko. Congress also used identical \"wages paid\" language in redefining the FICA and FUTA wage bases for tax purposes. Although the legislative history makes clear that Congress sought to achieve conformity between the tax and benefits provisions, the conformity Congress sought had nothing to do with Nierotko's treatment of backpay. Rather, Congress' purpose in amending the FICA and FUTA wage bases for tax and benefits purposes was to define the yardstick for measuring \"wages\" as the amount paid during the calendar year without regard to the year in which the employment occurred. Because the concern that animates Nierotko's treatment of backpay in the benefits context has no relevance to the tax side, it makes no sense to attribute to Congress a desire for conformity not only with respect to the general rule for measuring \"wages,\" but also with respect to Nierotko's backpay exception. Pp. 10-14.~      (e) There is some force to the Company's contention that the Government's refusal to allocate back wages to the year they should have been paid creates inequities in taxation and incentives for strategic behavior that Congress did not intend. But this case presents no structural unfairness in taxation comparable to the structural inequity in Nierotko's context. In Nierotko, an inflexible rule allocating backpay to the year it is actually paid would never work to the employee's advantage; it could inure only to the detriment of the employee, counter to the thrust of the benefits eligibility provisions. Here, by contrast, the Government's rule sometimes disadvantages the taxpayer, as in this case; other times it works to the disadvantage of the fisc. Anomalous results must be considered in light of Congress' evident interest in reducing complexity and minimizing administrative confusion within the FICA and FUTA tax schemes. Given these concerns, it cannot be said that the Government's rule is incompatible with the statutory scheme. The most that can be said is that Congress intended the tax provisions to be both efficiently administrable and fair, and that this case reveals the tension that sometimes exists when Congress seeks to meet those twin aims. Pp. 14-17.~      (f) Confronted with this tension, the Court defers to the Internal Revenue Service's interpretation. The Court does not sit as a committee of revision to perfect the administration of the tax laws. United States v. Correll, 389 U.S. 299, 306-307. Instead, it defers to the Commissioner's regulations as long as they implement the congressional mandate in a reasonable manner. Id., at 307. The Internal Revenue Service has long maintained regulations interpreting the FICA and FUTA tax provisions. In their current form, the regulations specify that wages must be taxed according to the year they are actually paid. Echoing the language in 26 U.S.C.  3111(a) (FICA) and 3301 (FUTA), these regulations have continued unchanged in their basic substance since 1940. Although the regulations, like the statute, do not specifically address backpay, the Service has consistently interpreted them to require taxation of back wages according to the year the wages are actually paid, regardless of when those wages were earned or should have been paid. The Court need not decide whether the Revenue Rulings themselves are entitled to deference. In this case, the Rulings simply reflect the agency's longstanding interpretation of its own regulations. Because that interpretation is reasonable, it attracts substantial judicial deference. Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U.S. 504, 512. Pp. 17-18. 215 F.3d 1325, reversed.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT~      Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and Stevens, O'Connor, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, and Breyer, JJ., joined. Scalia, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) impose excise taxes on employee wages to fund Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment compensation programs. This case concerns the application of FICA and FUTA taxes to payments of back wages. The Internal Revenue Service has consistently maintained that, for tax purposes, backpay awards should be attributed to the year the award is actually paid. Respondent Cleveland Indians Baseball Company (Company) urges, and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held, that such awards must be allocated, as they are for purposes of Social Security benefits eligibility, to the periods in which the wages should have been paid. According due respect to the Service's reasonable, longstanding construction of the governing statutes and its own regulations, we hold that back wages are subject to FICA and FUTA taxes by reference to the year the wages are in fact paid.~    ~    ~      2~      * Pursuant to a settlement of grievances asserted by the Major League Baseball Players Association concerning players' free agency rights, several Major League Baseball clubs agreed to pay $280 million to players with valid claims for salary damages. Under the agreement, the Company owed 8 players a total of $610,000 in salary damages for 1986, and it owed 14 players a total of $1,457,848 in salary damages for 1987. The Company paid the awards in 1994. No award recipient was a Company employee in that year.~    ~    ~      3~      This case concerns the proper FICA and FUTA tax treatment of the 1994 payments. Under FICA, both employees and employers must pay tax on wages to fund Social Security and Medicare; under FUTA, employers (but not employees) must pay tax on wages to fund unemployment benefits. For purposes of this litigation, the Government and the Company stipulated that the settlement payments awarded to the players qualify as \"wages\" within the meaning of FICA and FUTA. The question presented is whether those payments, characterized as back wages, should be taxed by reference to the year they were actually paid (1994), as the Government urges, or by reference to the years they should have been paid (1986 and 1987), as the Company and its supporting amicus, the Major League Baseball Players Association, contend.~    ~    ~      4~      In any given year, the amount of FICA and FUTA tax owed depends on two determinants. The first is the tax rate. 26 U.S.C.  3101 3111 (FICA), 3301 (FUTA). The second is the statutory ceiling on taxable wages (also called the wage base), which limits the amount of annual wages subject to tax. 3121(a)(1) (FICA), 3306(b)(1) (FUTA). Both determinants have increased over time. In 1986, the Social Security tax on employees and employers was 5.7 percent on wages up to $42,000;1 in 1987, it was 5.7 percent on wages up to $43,800;2 and in 1994, 6.2 percent on wages up to $60,600.3 Although the Medicare tax on employees and employers remained constant at 1.45 percent from 1986 to 1994,4 the taxable wage base rose from $42,000 in 1986 to $43,800 in 1987,5 and by 1994, Congress had abolished the wage ceiling, thereby subjecting all wages to the Medicare tax.6 In 1986 and 1987, the FUTA tax was 6.0 percent on wages up to $7,000;7 in 1994, it was 6.2 percent on wages up to $7,000.8~    ~    ~      5~      In this case, allocating the 1994 payments back to 1986 and 1987 works to the advantage of the Company and its former employees. The reason is that all but one of the employees who received back wages in 1994 had already collected wages from the Company exceeding the taxable maximum in 1986 and 1987. Because those employees as well as the Company paid the maximum amount of employment taxes chargeable in 1986 and 1987, allocating the 1994 payments back to those years would generate no additional FICA or FUTA tax liability. By contrast, treating the back wages as taxable in 1994 would subject both the Company and its former employees to significant tax liability. The Company paid none of the employees any other wages in 1994,9 and FICA and FUTA taxes attributable to that year would be calculated according to tax rates and wage bases higher than their levels in 1986 and 1987.~    ~    ~      6~      Uncertain about the proper rule of taxation, the Company paid its share of employment taxes on the back wages according to 1994 tax rates and wage bases. Its FICA payment totaled $99,382, and its FUTA payment totaled $1,008.10 After the Internal Revenue Service denied its claims for a refund of those payments, the Company initiated this action in District Court, relying on Bowman v. United States, 824 F.2d 528 (CA6 1987). In Bowman, the Sixth Circuit held that \"[a] settlement for back wages should not be allocated to the period when the employer finally pays but 'should be allocated to the periods when the regular wages were not paid as usual.' \" Id., at 530 (quoting Social Security Bd. v. Nierotko, 327 U.S. 358, 370 (1946)). The District Court, bound by Bowman, entered judgment for the Company and ordered the Government to refund $97,202 in FICA and FUTA taxes.11~    ~    ~      7~      On appeal, the Government observed that two Courts of Appeals have held, in disagreement with Bowman, that under the law as implemented by Treasury Regulations, wages are to be taxed for FICA purposes in the year they are actually received. Walker v. United States, 202 F.3d 1290, 1292-1293 (CA10 2000) (finding Nierotko \"inapposite\" and Bowman \"unpersuasive\"); Hemelt v. United States, 122 F.3d 204, 210 (CA4 1997) (finding it \"clear under the Treasury Regulations that 'wages' are to be taxed for FICA purposes in the year in which they are received\"). The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit nevertheless affirmed on the authority of Bowman. 215 F.3d 1325 (2000) (judgt. order).~    ~    ~      8~      We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict among the Courts of Appeals, 531 U.S. 943 (2000), and now reverse the Sixth Circuit's judgment.~    ~    II~    ~      9~      The Internal Revenue Code imposes employment taxes \"on every employer ... equal to [a percentage of] wages ... paid by him with respect to employment.\" 26 U.S.C.  3111(a), 3111(b), 3301. The Social Security tax provision, 3111(a), contains a table prescribing tax rates applicable to \"wages paid during\" each year from 1984 onward (e.g., \"In cases of wages paid during ... 1990 or thereafter ... [t]he rate shall be ... 6.2 percent.\"). The Medicare tax~    ~    ~      10~      provision, 3111(b)(6), says \"with respect to wages paid after December 31, 1985, the rate shall be 1.45 percent.\" And the FUTA tax provision, 26 U.S.C.  3301 (1994 ed., Supp. IV), says the rate shall be \"6.2 percent in the case of calendar years 1988 through 2007 ... of the total wages (as defined in section 3306(b)) paid by [the employer] during the calendar year.\"~    ~    ~      11~      Section 3121(a) of the Code establishes the annual ceiling on wages subject to Social Security tax. It does so by defining \"wages\" to exclude any remuneration \"paid to [an] individual by [an] employer during [a] calendar year\" that exceeds \"remuneration ... equal to the contribution and benefit base ... paid to [such] individual by [such] employer during the calendar year with respect to which such contribution and benefit base is effective.\" Section 3306(b)(1) similarly limits annual wages subject to FUTA tax by excluding from \"wages\" any remuneration \"paid to [an] individual by [an] employer during [a] calendar year\" that exceeds \"remuneration ... equal to $7,000 ... paid to [such] individual by [such] employer during [the] calendar year.\"~    ~    ~      12~      Both sides in this controversy have offered plausible interpretations of Congress' design. We set out next the parties' positions and explain why we ultimately defer to the Internal Revenue Service's reasonable, consistent, and longstanding interpretation of the FICA and FUTA provisions in point. Under that interpretation, wages must be taxed according to the year they are actually paid.~    ~    ~      13~      * In the Government's view, the text of the controlling FICA and FUTA tax provisions explicitly instructs that employment taxes shall be computed by applying the tax rate and wage base in effect when wages are actually paid. In particular, the Government calls attention to the statute's constant references to wages paid during a calendar year as the touchstone for determining the applicable tax rate and wage base. 26 U.S.C.  3111(a) (setting Social Security tax rates for \"wages paid during\" particular calendar years); 3121(a) (defining Social Security wage base in terms of \"remuneration ... paid ... during the calendar year\"); 3301 (setting FUTA tax rate as a percentage of \"wages ... paid ... during the calendar year\"); 3306(b)(1) (defining FUTA wage base in terms of \"remuneration ... paid ... during any calendar year\"). The meaning of this language, the Government contends, is plain: Wages are taxed according to the calendar year they are in fact paid, regardless of when they should have been paid.~    ~    ~      14~      In support of this reading, the Government observes that Congress chose the words in the current statute specifically to replace language in the original 1935 Social Security Act providing that FICA and FUTA tax rates applied to wages paid or received \"with respect to employment during the calendar year.\" Social Security Act (1935 Act), 801, 804, 901, 49 Stat. 636-637, 639 (emphasis added). The Treasury Department had interpreted this 1935 language to mean that wages are taxed at \"the rate in effect at the time of the performance of the services for which the wages were paid.\" Treas. Regs. 91, Arts. 202, 302 (1936) (emphasis added). In 1939, Congress amended the 1935 Act to provide that FICA and FUTA tax rates would no longer apply on the basis of when services were performed, but would instead apply \"with respect to wages paid during the calendar yea[r].\" Social Security Act Amendments of 1939 (1939 Amendments), 604, 608, 53 Stat. 1383, 1387 (emphasis added). This 1939 language remains essentially unchanged in the current FICA and FUTA tax provisions, 26 U.S.C.  3111(a) and 3301.~    ~    ~      15~      Acknowledging that the 1939 Amendments established a \"wages paid\" rule for FICA and FUTA taxation, the Company nevertheless argues that Social Security Bd. v. Nierotko, 327 U.S. 358 (1946), undermines the Government's plain language argument. According due weight to our precedent, we agree.~    ~    ~      16~      In Nierotko, the National Labor Relations Board had ordered the reinstatement of a wrongfully discharged employee with \"back pay\" covering wages lost during the period from February 1937 to September 1939. Id., at 359. The employer paid the award in July 1941. Id., at 359-360. The primary question presented and aired in the Court's opinion was whether backpay for a time in which the employee was not on the job should nevertheless count as \"wages\" in determining the employee's eligibility for Social Security benefits. Id., at 359. Notwithstanding the contrary view of the Social Security Board and the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the Court held that backpay covering the wrongful discharge period met the definition of \"wages\" in the 1935 Act. Id., at 360-370.~    ~    ~      17~      In the final two paragraphs of the Nierotko opinion, the Court took up the question of how the backpay award should be allocated for purposes of determining the worker's eligibility for benefits. As originally enacted, the Social Security Act extended benefits to persons over 65 who had earned at least $2,000 in wages in each of any five years after 1936. 1935 Act, 201(a), 210(c), 49 Stat. 622, 625. In 1939, however, Congress introduced a new scheme, which remains in place today, tying eligibility for benefits to the number of calendar-year \"quarters of coverage\" accumulated by an individual. 1939 Amendments, 209(g), (h), 53 Stat. 1376-1377 (codified at 42 U.S.C.  413(a)(2), 414). Section 209(g) defined a \"quarter of coverage\" as either \"a calendar quarter in which the individual has been paid not less than $50 in wages\" or any quarter except the first \"where an individual has been paid in a calendar year $3,000 or more in wages.\" 53 Stat. 1377.~    ~    ~      18~      Nierotko swiftly dispatched the question whether \" 'back pay' must be allocated as wages ... to the 'calendar quarters' of the year in which the money would have been earned, if the employee had not been wrongfully discharged.\" 327 U.S., at 370. Rejecting the Government's argument that such allocation was impermissible because the 1939 Amendments to the benefits scheme refer to \" 'wages' to be 'paid' in certain 'quarters,' \" id., at 370, and n. 25 (citing id., at 362, n. 7 (citing 209(g))), the Court concluded: \"If, as we have held above, 'back pay' is to be treated as wages, we have no doubt that it should be allocated to the periods when the regular wages were not paid as usual.\" Id., at 370.~    ~    ~      19~      Although the allocation question in Nierotko was a secondary issue addressed summarily by the Court, we think the Company is correct that Nierotko undercuts the plain meaning argument urged by the Government here. Nierotko found no conflict between an allocation-back rule for backpay and the language in 209(g) tying benefits eligibility to the number of calendar quarters \"in which\" a minimum amount of \"wages\" \"has been paid.\" The Court's allocation holding for benefits eligibility purposes, which the Government does not urge us to overrule, Tr. of Oral Arg. 9, thus turned on an implicit construction of 209(g)'s terms-\"wages\" \"paid\" \"in\" \"a calendar quarter\"-to include \"regular wages\" that should have been paid but \"were not paid as usual,\" 327 U.S., at 370. Given this construction of 209(g), now codified in 42 U.S.C.  413(a)(2), we cannot say that the FICA and FUTA provisions prescribing tax rates based on wages paid during a calendar year, codified in 26 U.S.C.  3111(a), 3301, have a plain meaning that precludes allocation of backpay to the year it should have been paid. Cf. Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways Comm'n, 502 U.S. 197, 205 (1991) (\"stare decisis is most compelling\" where \"a pure question of statutory construction\" is involved).~    ~    B~    ~      20~      From here, we part ways with the Company. Although we agree that Nierotko blocks the Government's argument that the \"wages paid\" formulation in 26 U.S.C.  3111(a) and 3301 has a dispositively plain meaning, we reject the Company's next contention. Because Nierotko read the 1939 \"wages paid\" language for benefits eligibility purposes to accommodate an allocation-back rule for backpay, the Company urges, the identical 1939 \"wages paid\" language for tax purposes must be read the same way. We do not agree that the latter follows from the former like the night, the day.~    ~    ~      21~      Nierotko dealt specifically and only with Social Security benefits eligibility, not with taxation. The Court's allocation holding in Nierotko in all likelihood reflected concern that the benefits scheme created in 1939 would be disserved by allowing an employer's wrongdoing to reduce the quarters of coverage an employee would otherwise be entitled to claim toward eligibility. No similar concern underlies the tax provisions. Although Social Security taxes are used to pay for Social Security benefits in the aggregate, there is no direct relation between taxes and benefits at the level of an individual employee. As the Company itself acknowledges, \"Social Security tax 'contributions,' unlike private pension contributions, do not create in the contributor a property right to benefits against the government, and wages rather than [tax] contributions are the statutory basis for calculating an individual's benefits.\" Brief for Respondent 14.~    ~    ~      22~      Nierotko thus does not compel symmetrical construction of the \"wages paid\" language in the discrete taxation and benefits eligibility contexts. Although we generally presume that \"identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning,\" Atlantic Cleaners  Dyers, Inc. v. United States, 286 U.S. 427, 433 (1932), the presumption \"is not rigid,\" and \"the meaning [of the same words] well may vary to meet the purposes of the law,\" ibid. Cf. Cook, \"Substance\" and \"Procedure\" in the Conflict of Laws, 42 Yale L. J. 333, 337 (1933) (\"The tendency to assume that a word which appears in two or more legal rules, and so in connection with more than one purpose, has and should have precisely the same scope in all of them ... has all the tenacity of original sin and must constantly be guarded against.\"). The benefits scheme delineated in Title 42 would \"no doubt\" be set awry without an allocation-back rule for back wages, notwithstanding \"accounting difficulties.\" Nierotko, 327 U.S., at 370. But that surely cannot be said for the taxation scheme described in Title 26, where Congress' evident concern was not worker eligibility for benefits, but fiscal administrability.12~    ~    ~      23~      The 1939 Amendments adopting the \"wages paid\" rule for taxation reflected Congress' worry that, as tax rates increase from year to year, \"difficulties and confusion\" would attend the taxation of wages payable in one year, but not actually paid until another year. S. Rep. No. 734, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., 75-76; see also H. R. Rep. No. 728, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., 57-58. Congress understood that an employee's annual compensation may be \"based on a percentage of profits, or on future royalties, the amount of which cannot be determined until long after the close of the year.\" S. Rep. No. 734, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., at 75. Requiring employers to \"estimate unascertained amounts and pay taxes and contributions on that basis\" would \"cause a burden on employers and administrative authorities alike.\" Id., at 75-76. Congress correctly anticipated that \"[t]he placing of [FICA and FUTA] tax[es] on the 'wages paid' basis [would] relieve this situation.\" Id., at 76. \"Under the amendment the rate applicable would be the rate in effect at the time that the wages are paid and received without reference to the rate which was in effect at the time the services were performed.\" H. R. Rep. No. 728, supra, at 58.~    ~    ~      24~      As an additional ground for construing the tax and benefits provisions in pari materia, the Company insists that Congress incorporated Nierotko's treatment of backpay into the tax provisions when it amended the Social Security Act shortly after Nierotko was decided. Prior to 1946, the FICA and FUTA wage bases had been defined in terms of remuneration \"paid ... with respect to employment during\" a given year. 1935 Act, 811(a), 49 Stat. 639 (FICA); 1939 Amendments, 606, 53 Stat. 1383 (FUTA). Paralleling the 1939 Amendments to the tax rate provisions, Congress in 1946 established the current \"wages paid\" rule for identifying the wages that compose the FICA and FUTA wage bases in a given year. Social Security Act Amendments of 1946 (1946 Amendments), 412, 414, 60 Stat. 989-991 (codified at 26 U.S.C.  3121(a), 3306(b)(1)). The 1946 law amended 209(a), which defines the Social Security wage base for purposes of benefits calculation, by adopting the \"wages paid\" language already present in 209(g), the provision construed in Nierotko. 414, 60 Stat. 990-991. Congress also used identical \"wages paid\" language in redefining the FICA and FUTA wage bases for tax purposes. 412, 60 Stat. 989. Relying on the presumption that 209(a), as amended, incorporated Nierotko's construction of 209(g), see Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 696-699 (1979), and observing that Congress redefined the wage bases for taxation to \"confor[m] with the changes in section 209(a),\" S. Rep. No. 1862, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 36 (1946); H. R. Rep. No. 2447, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 35 (1946), the Company urges that the amended benefits and tax provisions codified Nierotko's backpay allocation rule.~    ~    ~      25~      We are unpersuaded. Even assuming that the benefits provision, 209(a), is properly construed as incorporating Nierotko's reading of 209(g), we think the \"confor[mity]\" Congress sought to achieve between the tax and benefits provisions, S. Rep. No. 1862, supra, at 36; H. R. Rep. No. 2447, supra, at 35, had nothing to do with Nierotko's treatment of backpay. The Committee Reports make clear that Congress' purpose in amending the FICA and FUTA wage bases was to define the \"yardstick\" for measuring \"wages\" as \"the amount paid during the calendar year ... , without regard to the year in which the employment occurred.\" S. Rep. No. 1862, supra, at 35 (emphasis added); H. R. Rep. No. 2447, supra, at 35 (emphasis added). It is with respect to this rule-measuring \"wages\" based on \"the amount paid during the calendar year\"-that Congress sought conformity between the Title 26 tax provisions and the Title 42 benefits provision. See S. Rep. No. 1862, supra, at 36 (tax wage base), 37 (benefits wage base); H. R. Rep. No. 2447, supra, at 35 (tax wage base), 36 (benefits wage base). Far from indicating an intent to codify Nierotko, those Reports suggest that Congress, if it considered Nierotko at all, considered it an exception to the general rule for measuring \"wages\" in a given year.13 Because the concern that animates Nierotko's treatment of backpay in the benefits context has no relevance to the tax side, supra, at 10-11, it makes no sense to attribute to Congress a desire for conformity not only with respect to the general rule for measuring \"wages,\" but also with respect to Nierotko's backpay exception.~    ~    C~    ~      26~      Were the Company to rely solely on arguments for symmetry in statutory construction, we would be inclined to conclude, given Nierotko's lack of concern with taxation, that the tax provisions themselves, informed by legislative purpose, require back wages to be taxed according to the year they are actually paid. But the Company has one more arrow in its quiver.~    ~    ~      27~      Apart from its arguments for symmetry, the Company contends that the Government's refusal to allocate back wages to the year they should have been paid creates inequities in taxation and incentives for strategic behavior that Congress did not intend. This contention is not without force. Under the Government's rule, an employee who should have been paid $100,000 in 1986, but is instead paid $50,000 in 1986 and $50,000 in backpay in 1994, would owe more tax than if she had been paid the full $100,000 due in 1986. Conversely, a wrongdoing employer who should have paid an employee $50,000 in each of five years covered by a $250,000 backpay award would pay only one year's worth of employment taxes (limited by the annual ceilings on taxable wages) in the year the award is actually paid. The Government's rule thus appears to exempt some wages that should be taxed and to tax some wages that should be exempt.~    ~    ~      28~      Applying the Government's rule to other provisions of the Code produces similar anomalies. Section 3121(a)(4), for example, exempts disability benefits from FICA tax if paid by an employer to an employee more than six months after the employee worked for the employer. 26 U.S.C.  3121(a)(4). Disability benefits included in a backpay award would be exempt from FICA tax if the employee had not worked for the employer for six months prior to the backpay award, even if the benefits should have been paid within six months after the employee stopped working for the employer. According to the Company, such results amount to tax windfalls and invite employers wrongfully to withhold pay or benefits in order to reap the advantages of a strategically timed payment. See Brief for Respondent 33-40 (additional examples of windfalls and avoidance schemes). These outcomes may be avoided, the Company argues, by construing the tax provisions to require taxation of back wages according to the year the wages should have been paid.~    ~    ~      29~      It is, of course, true that statutory construction \"is a holistic endeavor\" and that the meaning of a provision is \"clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme ... [when] only one of the permissible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.\" United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., 484 U.S. 365, 371 (1988). The Company's examples leave little doubt that the Government's rule generates a degree of arbitrariness in the operation of the tax statutes. But in Nierotko's context, an inflexible rule allocating backpay to the year it is actually paid would never work to the employee's advantage; it could inure only to the detriment of the employee, counter to the thrust of the benefits eligibility provisions.14 In this case, by contrast, there is no comparable structural unfairness in taxation. The Government's rule sometimes disadvantages the taxpayer, as in this case. Other times it works to the disadvantage of the fisc, as the Company's examples show. The anomalous results to which the Company points must be considered in light of Congress' evident interest in reducing complexity and minimizing administrative confusion within the FICA and FUTA tax schemes. See supra, at 11-12. Given the practical administrability concerns that underpin the tax provisions, we cannot say that the Government's rule is incompatible with the statutory scheme. The most we can say is that Congress intended the tax provisions to be both efficiently administrable and fair, and that this case reveals the tension that sometimes exists when Congress seeks to meet those twin aims.~    ~    D~    ~      30~      Confronted with this tension, \"we do not sit as a committee of revision to perfect the administration of the tax laws.\" United States v. Correll, 389 U.S. 299, 306-307 (1967). Instead, we defer to the Commissioner's regulations as long as they \"implement the congressional mandate in some reasonable manner.\" Id., at 307. \"We do this because Congress has delegated to the [Commissioner], not to the courts, the task of prescribing all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement of the Internal Revenue Code.\" National Muffler Dealers Assn., Inc. v. United States, 440 U.S. 472, 477 (1979) (citing Correll, 389 U.S., at 307 (citing 26 U.S.C.  7805(a))). This delegation \"helps guarantee that the rules will be written by 'masters of the subject' ... who will be responsible for putting the rules into effect.\" 440 U.S., at 477 (quoting United States v. Moore, 95 U.S. 760, 763 (1878)).~    ~    ~      31~      The Internal Revenue Service has long maintained regulations interpreting the FICA and FUTA tax provisions. In their current form, the regulations specify that the employer tax \"attaches at the time that the wages are paid by the employer,\" 26 CFR  31.3111-3 (2000) (emphasis added), and \"is computed by applying to the wages paid by the employer the rate in effect at the time such wages are paid,\" 31.3111-2(c) (emphasis added); see 31.3301-2, -3(b) (same for FUTA). Echoing the language in 26 U.S.C.  3111(a) (FICA tax) and 3301 (FUTA tax), these regulations have continued unchanged in their basic substance since 1940. See T. D. 6516, 25 Fed. Reg. 13032 (1960); Treas. Regs. 107 (as amended by T. D. 5566, 1947-2 Cum. Bull. 148); Treas. Regs. 106 (as amended by T. D. 5566, 1947-2 Cum. Bull. 148); Treas. Regs. 106, 402.301-.303, 402.401-.403 (1940). Cf. National Muffler, 440 U.S., at 477 (\"A regulation may have particular force if it is a substantially contemporaneous construction of the statute by those presumed to have been aware of congressional intent.\").~    ~    ~      32~      Although the regulations, like the statute, do not specifically address backpay, the Internal Revenue Service has consistently interpreted them to require taxation of back wages according to the year the wages are actually paid, regardless of when those wages were earned or should have been paid. Rev. Rul. 89-35, 1989-1 Cum. Bull. 280; Rev. Rul. 78-336, 1978-2 Cum. Bull. 255. We need not decide whether the Revenue Rulings themselves are entitled to deference. In this case, the Rulings simply reflect the agency's longstanding interpretation of its own regulations. Because that interpretation is reasonable, it attracts substantial judicial deference. Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U.S. 504, 512 (1994). We do not resist according such deference in reviewing an agency's steady interpretation of its own 61-year-old regulation implementing a 62-year-old statute. \"Treasury regulations and interpretations long continued without substantial change, applying to unamended or substantially reenacted statutes, are deemed to have received congressional approval and have the effect of law.\" Cottage Savings Assn. v.

To illustrate, suppose a player received $50,000 in back wages from the Cleveland Indians and an additional $50,000 in wages from the New York Mets in 1994. Assuming all $100,000 in wages are taxed in 1994, the player would be entitled to a credit or refund of Social Security tax paid in excess of the amount of tax due on $60,600. By contrast, the Indians and the Mets would each be liable for Social Security taxes on $50,000 in wages paid to that player. 26 U.S.C.  3111 (Social Security tax is \"an excise tax, with respect to having individuals in his employ\"). Thus, under the Government's proposed rule, the Cleveland Indians would owe Social Security taxes on all amounts up to $60,600 that it paid to each player in 1994, regardless of whether the players themselves had reached or exceeded the $60,600 ceiling through multiple wage sources.~      ~      ~        10~         Although the Company also withheld $99,382 to pay the employees' share of FICA taxes, it does not seek to recover any taxes paid on behalf of the employees in this suit.~      ~      ~        11~         This amount is slightly less than the total FICA and FUTA taxes paid by the Company in 1994. The reason is that one of the employees who received a 1994 payment for wages due in 1987 received no wages from the Company in 1987. The Company thus owed a small amount of FICA and FUTA taxes on the back wages paid to him even when those wages were allocated back to 1987.~      ~      ~        12~         In determining that \"accounting difficulties\" were \"not ... insuperable\" to its allocation holding, Nierotko noted that \" 'back pay' is now treated distributively\" under 119 of the Revenue Act of 1943. 327 U.S., at 370, and n. 26. Section 119 provided that backpay exceeding 15 percent of gross income may be allocated to earlier periods for income tax purposes if such allocation would reduce the taxpayer's liability. 119(a), 58 Stat. 39. But Congress eliminated the 1943 backpay allocation rule in 1964, see Pub. L. 88-272, 232(a), 78 Stat. 107, leaving behind the principle, \"too firmly embedded in the income tax law to permit of any question,\" that \"payments of compensation are income to a taxpayer on a cash basis in the year of receipt, as distinguished from the year in which the compensation is earned,\" 2 J. Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation 12.42, p. 179 (1973). The symmetry urged by the Company in construing the tax and benefits provisions of FICA and FUTA thus comes only at the expense of asymmetry in the collection of income taxes and employment taxes.~      ~      ~        13~         Indeed, the contemporaneous understanding of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue was that the 1946 Amendments supplanted Nierotko's allocation rule for backpay. See Letter from Joseph D. Nunan, Jr., Commissioner of Internal Revenue, to Social Security Administration, Bureau of Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (Mar. 6, 1947) (\"The Nierotko decision requiring your Agency to make an allocation of the back pay award to prior periods was rendered on the basis of the law in effect at that time. The Social Security Act Amendments of 1946, having been enacted subsequent to the date of the Nierotko decision, must be interpreted in the light of the language contained in such Amendments and the Congressional intent.\") (available in Lodging for Respondent, Exh. F). Nevertheless, for benefits eligibility and calculation purposes, the Social Security Administration (SSA) by regulation continues to apply the Nierotko rule to \"[b]ack pay under a statute,\" 20 CFR  404.1242(b) (2000) (such backpay \"is allocated to the periods of time in which it should have been paid if the employer had not violated the statute\"), while declining to apply Nierotko to \"[b]ack pay not under a statute,\" 404.1242(c) (\"This back pay cannot be allocated to prior periods of time but must be reported by the employer for the period in which it is paid.\").~      ~      ~        14~         The SSA has interpreted its regulation governing \"[b]ack pay under a statute,\" 20 CFR  404.1242(b) (2000), to allow the employee to choose whether to allocate the back pay to the year it is paid or to the year it should have been paid. Social Security Administration, Reporting Back Pay and Special Wage Payments to the Social Security Administration 2, Pub. 957 (Sept. 1997).~      ~    ~    ~      36~      Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment.~    ~    ~      37~      If I believed that the text of the tax statutes addressed the issue before us, I might well find for the respondent, giving that text the same meaning the Court found it to have in the benefits provisions of the Social Security Act. See Social Security Bd. v. Nierotko, 327 U.S. 358, 370, and n. 25 (1946). The Court's principal reason for assigning the identical language a different meaning in the present case-leaving aside statements in testimony and Committee Reports that I have no reason to believe Congress was aware of-is that tax assessments do not present the equitable considerations implicated by the potential arbitrary decrease of benefits in Nierotko. See ante, at 10-11. But the Court acknowledges that departing from Nierotko will produce arbitrary variations in tax liability. See ante, at 15-16. As between an immediate arbitrary increase in tax liability and a deferred arbitrary decrease in benefits, I cannot say the latter is the greater inequity. The difference is at least not so stark as to cause me to regard the two regulatory schemes as different in kind, which I would insist upon before giving different meanings to identical statutory texts.~    ~    ~      38~      In fact, however, I do not think that the text of the FICA and FUTA provisions, 26 U.S.C.  3111(a), 3111(b), 3301, addresses the issue we face today. Those provisions, which direct that taxes shall be assessed against \"wages paid\" during the calendar year, would be controlling if the income we had before us were \"wages\" within the normal meaning of that term; but it is not. The question we face is whether damages awards compensating an employee for lost wages should be regarded for tax purposes as wages paid when the award is received, or rather as wages paid when they would have been paid but for the employer's unlawful actions. (The parties have stipulated that the damages awards should be regarded as taxable \"wages paid\" of some sort, see also Social Security Bd. v. Nierotko, supra, at 364-370.) The proper treatment of such damages awards is an issue the statute does not address, and hence it is an issue left to the reasonable resolution of the administering agency, here the Internal Revenue Service. In Nierotko, which we decided at a time when it was common for courts to fill statutory gaps that would now be left to the agency, we provided one rule for purposes of the benefits provisions. The Internal Revenue Service has since provided another rule for purposes of the tax provisions. Both rules are reasonable; neither is compelled; and neither involves a direct application of the statutory term \"wages paid\" which would require (or at least strongly suggest) a uniform result. I therefore concur in the Court's judgment deferring to the Government's regulations.~    ~    ",

Readers are requested to notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D. C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.ROBERT SHAW, et al., PETITIONERSv.KEVIN MURPHY, RESPONDENTSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    No. 99-1613.~    Argued January 16, 2001~    Decided April 18, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      While respondent Murphy was incarcerated in state prison, he learned that a fellow inmate had been charged with assaulting a correctional officer. Murphy decided to assist the inmate with his defense and sent him a letter, which was intercepted in accordance with prison policy. Based on the letter's content, the prison sanctioned Murphy for violating prison rules prohibiting insolence and interfering with due process hearings. Murphy then sought declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C.  1983 alleging that the disciplinary action violated, inter alia, his First Amendment rights, including the right to provide legal assistance to other inmates. In granting petitioners summary judgment, the District Court applied the decision in Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89-that a prison regulation impinging on inmates' constitutional rights is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests-and found a valid, rational connection between the inmate correspondence policy and the objectives of prison order, security, and inmate rehabilitation. The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that inmates have a First Amendment right to give legal assistance to other inmates and that this right affected the Turner analysis.~      Held:   1. Inmates do not possess a special First Amendment right to provide legal assistance to fellow inmates that enhances the protections otherwise available under Turner. Prisoners' constitutional rights are more limited in scope than the constitutional rights held by individuals in society at large. For instance, some First Amendment rights are simply inconsistent with the corrections system's \"legitimate penological objectives,\" Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 822, and thus this Court has sustained restrictions on, e.g., inmate-to-inmate written correspondence, Turner, supra, at 93. Moreover, because courts are ill equipped to deal with the complex and intractable problems of prisons, Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 404-405, this Court has generally deferred to prison officials' judgment in upholding such regulations against constitutional challenge. Turner reflects this understanding, setting a unitary, deferential standard for reviewing prisoners' claims that does not permit an increase in the constitutional protection whenever a prisoner's communication includes legal advice. To increase the constitutional protection based upon a communication's content first requires an assessment of that content's value. But the Turner test simply does not accommodate valuations of content. On the contrary, it concerns only the relationship between the asserted penological interests and the prison regulation. Moreover, prison officials are to remain the primary arbiters of the problems that arise in prison management. 482 U.S., at 89. Seeking to avoid unnecessarily perpetuating federal courts' involvement in prison administration affairs, the Court rejects an alteration of the Turner analysis that would entail additional federal-court oversight. Even if this Court were to consider giving special protection to particular kinds of speech based on content, it would not do so for speech that includes legal advice. Augmenting First Amendment protection for such advice would undermine prison officials' ability to address the complex and intractable problems of prison administration. Id., at 84. The legal text could be an excuse for making clearly inappropriate comments, which may circulate among prisoners despite prison measures to screen individual inmates or officers from the remarks. Pp. 4-8.~      2. To prevail on remand on the question whether the prison regulations, as applied to Murphy, are reasonably related to legitimate penological interests, he must overcome the presumption that the prison officials acted within their broad discretion. P. 8.~      195 F.3d 1121, reversed and remanded.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT~      Thomas, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. Ginsburg, J., filed a concurring opinion.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      Under our decision in Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987), restrictions on prisoners' communications to other inmates are constitutional if the restrictions are \"reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\" Id., at 89. In this case, we are asked to decide whether prisoners possess a First Amendment right to provide legal assistance that enhances the protections otherwise available under Turner. We hold that they do not.~    ~    ~      2~      * While respondent Kevin Murphy was incarcerated at the Montana State Prison, he served as an \"inmate law clerk,\" providing legal assistance to fellow prisoners. Upon learning that inmate Pat Tracy had been charged with assaulting Correctional Officer Glen Galle, Murphy decided to assist Tracy with his defense. Prison rules prohibited Murphy's assignment to the case,1 but he nonetheless investigated the assault. After discovering that other inmates had complained about Officer Galle's conduct, Murphy sent Tracy a letter, which included the following:~    ~    ~      3~      \"I do want to help you with your case against Galle. It wasn't your fault and I know he provoked whatever happened! Don't plead guilty because we can get at least 100 witnesses to testify that Galle is an over zealous guard who has a personal agenda to punish and harrass [sic] inmates. He has made homo-sexual [sic] advances towards certain inmates and that can be brought up into the record. There are petitions against him and I have tried to get the Unit Manager to do something about what he does in Close II, but all that happened is that I received two writeups from him myself as retaliation. So we must pursue this out of the prison system. I am filing a suit with everyone in Close I and II named against him. So you can use that too!~    ~    ~      4~      \"Another poiont [sic] is that he grabbed you from behind. You tell your lawyer to get ahold of me on this. Don't take a plea bargain unless it's for no more time.\" App. 50.~    ~    ~      5~      In accordance with prison policy, prison officials intercepted the letter, and petitioner Robert Shaw, an officer in the maximum-security unit, reviewed it. Based on the accusations against Officer Galle, Shaw cited Murphy for violations of the prison's rules prohibiting insolence, interference with due process hearings, and conduct that disrupts or interferes with the security and orderly operation of the institution. After a hearing, Murphy was found guilty of violating the first two prohibitions. The hearings officer sanctioned him by imposing a suspended sentence of 10 days' detention and issuing demerits that could affect his custody level.~    ~    ~      6~      In response, Murphy brought this action, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under Rev. Stat. 1979, 42 U.S.C.  1983. The case was styled as a class action, brought on behalf of himself, other inmate law clerks, and other prisoners. The complaint alleged that the disciplining of Murphy violated due process, the rights of inmates to access the courts, and, as relevant here, Murphy's First Amendment rights, including the right to provide legal assistance to other inmates.~    ~    ~      7~      After discovery, the District Court granted petitioners' motion for summary judgment on all of Murphy's claims. On the First Amendment claim, the court found that Murphy was not formally acting as an inmate law clerk when he wrote the letter, and that Murphy's claims should therefore \"be analyzed without consideration of any privilege that law clerk status might provide.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 24. The District Court then applied our decision in Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987), which held that a prison regulation impinging on inmates' constitutional rights is valid \"if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests,\" id., at 89. Finding a \"valid, rational connection between the prison inmate correspondence policy and the objectives of prison order, security, and inmate rehabilitation,\" the District Court rejected Murphy's First Amendment claim. App. to Pet. for Cert. 25.~    ~    ~      8~      The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. It premised its analysis on the proposition that \"inmates have a First Amendment right to assist other inmates with their legal claims.\" 195 F.3d 1121, 1124 (1999). Murphy enjoyed this right of association, the court concluded, because he was providing legal advice that potentially was relevant to Tracy's defense. The Court of Appeals then applied our decision in Turner, but it did so only against the backdrop of this First Amendment right, which, the court held, affected the balance of the prisoner's interests against the government's interests. Concluding that the balance tipped in favor of Murphy, the Court of Appeals upheld Murphy's First Amendment claim.~    ~    ~      9~      Other Courts of Appeals have rejected similar claims. See, e.g., Gibbs v. Hopkins, 10 F.3d 373, 378 (CA6 1993) (no constitutional right to assist other inmates with legal claims); Smith v. Maschner, 899 F.2d 940, 950 (CA10 1990) (same); Gassler v. Rayl, 862 F.2d 706, 707-708 (CA8 1988) (same). To resolve the conflict, we granted certiorari. 530 U.S. 1303 (2000).~    ~    II~    ~      10~      In this case, we are not asked to decide whether prisoners have any First Amendment rights when they send legal correspondence to one another. In Turner, we held that restrictions on inmate-to-inmate communications pass constitutional muster only if the restrictions are reasonably related to legitimate and neutral governmental objectives. 482 U.S., at 89. We did not limit our holding to nonlegal correspondence, and petitioners do not ask us to construe it that way. Instead, the question presented here simply asks whether Murphy possesses a First Amendment right to provide legal advice that enhances the protections otherwise available under Turner. The effect of such a right, as the Court of Appeals described it, 195 F.3d, at 1127, would be that inmate-to-inmate correspondence that includes legal assistance would receive more First Amendment protection than correspondence without any legal assistance. We conclude that there is no such special right.~    ~    ~      11~      Traditionally, federal courts did not intervene in the internal affairs of prisons and instead \"adopted a broad hands-off attitude toward problems of prison administration.\" Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 404 (1974). Indeed, for much of this country's history, the prevailing view was that a prisoner was a mere \"slave of the State,\" who \"not only forfeited his liberty, but all his personal rights except those which the law in its humanity accords him.\" Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc., 433 U.S. 119, 139 (1977) (Marshall, J., dissenting) (quoting Ruffin v. Commonwealth, 62 Va. 790, 796 (1871)) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). In recent decades, however, this Court has determined that incarceration does not divest prisoners of all constitutional protections. Inmates retain, for example, the right to be free from racial discrimination, Lee v. Washington, 390 U.S. 333 (1968) (per curiam), the right to due process, Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539 (1974), and, as relevant here, certain protections of the First Amendment, Turner, supra.~    ~    ~      12~      We nonetheless have maintained that the constitutional rights that prisoners possess are more limited in scope than the constitutional rights held by individuals in society at large. In the First Amendment context, for instance, some rights are simply inconsistent with the status of a prisoner or \"with the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system,\" Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 822 (1974). We have thus sustained proscriptions of media interviews with individual inmates, see id., at 833-835, prohibitions on the activities of a prisoners' labor union, see North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc., supra, at 133, and restrictions on inmate-to-inmate written correspondence, see Turner, supra, at 93. Moreover, because the \"problems of prisons in America are complex and intractable,\" and because courts are particularly \"ill equipped\" to deal with these problems, Martinez, supra, at 404-405, we generally have deferred to the judgments of prison officials in upholding these regulations against constitutional challenge.~    ~    ~      13~      Reflecting this understanding, in Turner we adopted a unitary, deferential standard for reviewing prisoners' constitutional claims: \"[W]hen a prison regulation impinges on inmates' constitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\" 482 U.S., at 89. Under this standard, four factors are relevant. First and foremost, \"there must be a 'valid, rational connection' between the prison regulation and the legitimate [and neutral] governmental interest put forward to justify it.\" Ibid. (quoting Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576, 586 (1984)). If the connection between the regulation and the asserted goal is \"arbitrary or irrational,\" then the regulation fails, irrespective of whether the other factors tilt in its favor. 482 U.S., at 89-90. In addition, courts should consider three other factors: the existence of \"alternative means of exercising the right\" available to inmates; \"the impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have on guards and other inmates, and on the allocation of prison resources generally;\" and \"the absence of ready alternatives\" available to the prison for achieving the governmental objectives. Id., at 90.~    ~    ~      14~      Because Turner provides the test for evaluating prisoners' First Amendment challenges, the issue before us is whether Turner permits an increase in constitutional protection whenever a prisoner's communication includes legal advice. We conclude that it does not. To increase the constitutional protection based upon the content of a communication first requires an assessment of the value of that content.2 But the Turner test, by its terms, simply does not accommodate valuations of content. On the contrary, the Turner factors concern only the relationship between the asserted penological interests and the prison regulation. Id., at 89.~    ~    ~      15~      Moreover, under Turner and its predecessors, prison officials are to remain the primary arbiters of the problems that arise in prison management. Ibid.; see also Martinez, 416 U.S., at 405 (\"[C]ourts are ill equipped to deal with the increasingly urgent problems of prison administration and reform\"). If courts were permitted to enhance constitutional protection based on their assessments of the content of the particular communications, courts would be in a position to assume a greater role in decisions affecting prison administration. Seeking to avoid \" 'unnecessarily perpetuat[ing] the involvement of the federal courts in affairs of prison administration,' \" Turner, 482 U.S., at 89 (quoting Martinez, supra, at 407) (alteration in original), we reject an alteration of the Turner analysis that would entail additional federal-court oversight.~    ~    ~      16~      Finally, even if we were to consider giving special protection to particular kinds of speech based upon content, we would not do so for speech that includes legal advice.3 Augmenting First Amendment protection for inmate legal advice would undermine prison officials' ability to address the \"complex and intractable\" problems of prison administration. Turner, supra, at 84. Although supervised inmate legal assistance programs may serve valuable ends, it is \"indisputable\" that inmate law clerks \"are sometimes a menace to prison discipline\" and that prisoners have an \"acknowledged propensity ... to abuse both the giving and the seeking of [legal] assistance.\" Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 488, 490 (1969). Prisoners have used legal correspondence as a means for passing contraband and communicating instructions on how to manufacture drugs or weapons. See Brief for State of Florida et al. as Amici Curiae 6-8; see also Turner, supra, at 93 (\"[P]risoners could easily write in jargon or codes to prevent detection of their real messages\"). The legal text also could be an excuse for making clearly inappropriate comments, which \"may be expected to circulate among prisoners,\" Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401, 412 (1989), despite prison measures to screen individual inmates or officers from the remarks.~    ~    ~      17~      We thus decline to cloak the provision of legal assistance with any First Amendment protection above and beyond the protection normally accorded prisoners' speech. Instead, the proper constitutional test is the one we set forth in Turner. Irrespective of whether the correspondence contains legal advice, the constitutional analysis is the same.~    ~    III~    ~      18~      Under Turner, the question remains whether the prison regulations, as applied to Murphy, are \"reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\" Turner, supra, at 89. To prevail, Murphy must overcome the presumption that the prison officials acted within their \"broad discretion.\" Abbott, supra, at 413. Petitioners ask us to answer, rather than remand, the question whether Murphy has satisfied this heavy burden. We decline petitioners' request, however, because we granted certiorari only to decide whether inmates possess a special First Amendment right to provide legal assistance to fellow inmates.~    ~    ~      19~      * * *~    ~    ~      20~      The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      21~      It is so ordered.~    ~    Ginsburg, J., concurring~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         Tracy had requested that Murphy be assigned to his case. App. 84. Prison officials, however, denied that request because prison policy forbade high-security inmates, such as Murphy, from meeting with maximum-security inmates, including Tracy. App. to Pet. for Cert. 19. Prison officials offered Tracy another law clerk to assist him. App. 84.~      ~      ~        2~         The Court of Appeals made such an assessment when it \"balance[d] the importance of the prisoner's infringed right against the importance of the penological interest served by the rule.\" See 195 F.3d, 1121, 1127 (CA9 1999) (quoting Bradley v. Hall, 64 F.3d 1276, 1280 (CA9 1995)).~      ~      ~        3~         Murphy suggests that the right to provide legal advice follows from a right to receive legal advice. However, even if one right followed from the other, Murphy is incorrect in his assumption that there is a freestanding right to receive legal advice. Under our right-of-access precedents, inmates have a right to receive legal advice from other inmates only when it is a necessary \"means for ensuring a 'reasonably adequate opportunity to present claimed violations of fundamental constitutional rights to the courts.' \" Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 350-351 (1996) (quoting Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 825 (1977)).~        Justice Ginsburg, concurring.~        I agree with the Court that the Ninth Circuit erred in holding that the First Amendment secures to prisoners a freestanding right to provide legal assistance to other inmates. I note, furthermore, that Murphy does not contest the prison's right to intercept prisoner-to-prisoner correspondence. But Murphy's 1983 complaint does allege that the prison rules under which he was disciplined-rules forbidding insolence and interference with due process hearings-are vague and overbroad as applied to him in this case*. The Ninth Circuit passed over that charge when it ruled, erroneously, that an inmate's provision of legal assistance to another inmate is an activity specially protected by the First Amendment. 195 F.3d 1121, 1128 (1999). The remand for which the Court provides should not impede Murphy from reasserting claims that the Court of Appeals so far has left untouched.~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        *~         The rule forbidding insolence defines \"insolence\" as \"[w]ords, actions or other behavior which is intended to harass or cause alarm in an employee.\" Mont.

Section 601 of that Title prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in covered programs and activities. Section 602 authorizes federal agencies to effectuate 601 by issuing regulations, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) in an exercise of this authority promulgated a regulation forbidding funding recipients to utilize criteria or administrative methods having the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination based on the prohibited grounds. Respondent Sandoval brought this class action to enjoin the Department's decision to administer state driver's license examinations only in English, arguing that it violated the DOJ regulation because it had the effect of subjecting non-English speakers to discrimination based on their national origin. Agreeing, the District Court enjoined the policy and ordered the Department to accommodate non-English speakers. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed. Both courts rejected petitioners' argument that Title VI did not provide respondents a cause of action to enforce the regulation.~      Held: There is no private right of action to enforce disparate-impact regulations promulgated under Title VI. Pp. 3-17.~      (a) Three aspects of Title VI must be taken as given. First, private individuals may sue to enforce 601. See, e.g., Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 694, 696, 699, 703, 710-711. Second, 601 prohibits only intentional discrimination. See, e.g., Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 293. Third, it must be assumed for purposes of deciding this case that regulations promulgated under 602 may validly proscribe activities that have a disparate impact on racial groups, even though such activities are permissible under 601. Pp. 3-5.~      (b) This Court has not, however, held that Title VI disparate-impact regulations may be enforced through a private right of action. Cannon was decided on the assumption that the respondent there had intentionally discriminated against the petitioner, see 441 U.S., at 680. In Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City, 463 U.S. 582, the Court held that private individuals could not recover compensatory damages under Title VI except for intentional discrimination. Of the five Justices who also voted to uphold disparate-impact regulations, three expressly reserved the question of a direct private right of action to enforce them, 463 U.S., at 645, n. 18. Pp. 5-7.~      (c) Nor does it follow from the three points taken as given that Congress must have intended such a private right of action. There is no doubt that regulations applying 601's ban on intentional discrimination are covered by the cause of action to enforce that section. But the disparate-impact regulations do not simply apply 601-since they forbid conduct that 601 permits-and thus the private right of action to enforce 601 does not include a private right to enforce these regulations. See Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U.S. 164, 173. That right must come, if at all, from the independent force of 602. Pp. 7-10.~      (d) Like substantive federal law itself, private rights of action to enforce federal law must be created by Congress. Touche Ross  Co. v. Redington, 442 U.S. 560, 578. This Court will not revert to the understanding of private causes of action, represented by J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U.S. 426, 433, that held sway when Title VI was enacted. That understanding was abandoned in Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66, 78. Nor does the Court agree with the Government's contention that cases interpreting statutes enacted prior to Cort v. Ash have given dispositive weight to the expectations that the enacting Congress had formed in light of the contemporary legal context. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner  Smith, Inc. v. Curran, 456 U.S. 353, 378-379; Cannon, supra, at 698-699; and Thompson v. Thompson, 484 U.S. 174, distinguished. Pp. 10-12.~      (e) The search for Congress's intent in this case begins and ends with Title VI's text and structure. The \"rights-creating\" language so critical to Cannon's 601 analysis, 441 U.S., at 690, n. 13, is completely absent from 602. Whereas 601 decrees that \"[n]o person ... shall ... be subjected to discrimination,\" 602 limits federal agencies to \"effectuat[ing]\" rights created by 601. And 602 focuses neither on the individuals protected nor even on the funding recipients being regulated, but on the regulating agencies. Hence, there is far less reason to infer a private remedy in favor of individual persons, Cannon, supra, at 690-691. The methods 602 expressly provides for enforcing its regulations, which place elaborate restrictions on agency enforcement, also suggest a congressional intent not to create a private remedy through 602. See, e.g., Karahalios v. Federal Employees, 489 U.S. 527, 533. Pp. 12-15.~      (f) The Court rejects arguments that the regulations at issue contain rights-creating language and so must be privately enforceable; that amendments to Title VI in 1003 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986 and 6 of the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 \"ratified\" decisions finding an implied private right of action to enforce the regulations; and that the congressional intent to create a right of action must be inferred under Curran, supra, at 353, 381-382. Pp. 15-17.~      197 F.3d 484, reversed.~      Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ., joined. Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.~      Opinion of the Court~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT~      Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      This case presents the question whether private individuals may sue to enforce disparate-impact regulations promulgated under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.~    ~    ~      2~      * The Alabama Department of Public Safety (Department), of which petitioner James Alexander is the Director, accepted grants of financial assistance from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and Department of Transportation (DOT) and so subjected itself to the restrictions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 252, as amended, 42 U.S.C.  2000d et seq. Section 601 of that Title provides that no person shall, \"on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity\" covered by Title VI. 42 U.S.C.  2000d. Section 602 authorizes federal agencies \"to effectuate the provisions of [601] ... by issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability,\" 42 U.S.C.  2000d-1, and the DOJ in an exercise of this authority promulgated a regulation forbidding funding recipients to \"utilize criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin ... .\" 28 CFR  42.104(b)(2) (1999). See also 49 CFR  21.5(b)(2) (2000) (similar DOT regulation).~    ~    ~      3~      The State of Alabama amended its Constitution in 1990 to declare English \"the official language of the state of Alabama.\" Amdt. 509. Pursuant to this provision and, petitioners have argued, to advance public safety, the Department decided to administer state driver's license examinations only in English. Respondent Sandoval, as representative of a class, brought suit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama to enjoin the English-only policy, arguing that it violated the DOJ regulation because it had the effect of subjecting non-English speakers to discrimination based on their national origin. The District Court agreed. It enjoined the policy and ordered the Department to accommodate non-English speakers. Sandoval v. Hagan, 7 F. Supp. 2d 1234 (1998). Petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which affirmed. Sandoval v. Hagan, 197 F.3d 484 (1999). Both courts rejected petitioners' argument that Title VI did not provide respondents a cause of action to enforce the regulation.~    ~    ~      4~      We do not inquire here whether the DOJ regulation was authorized by 602, or whether the courts below were correct to hold that the English-only policy had the effect of discriminating on the basis of national origin. The petition for writ of certiorari raised, and we agreed to review, only the question posed in the first paragraph of this opinion: whether there is a private cause of action to enforce the regulation. 530 U.S. 1305 (2000).~    ~    II~    ~      5~      Although Title VI has often come to this Court, it is fair to say (indeed, perhaps an understatement) that our opinions have not eliminated all uncertainty regarding its commands. For purposes of the present case, however, it is clear from our decisions, from Congress's amendments of Title VI, and from the parties' concessions that three aspects of Title VI must be taken as given. First, private individuals may sue to enforce 601 of Title VI and obtain both injunctive relief and damages. In Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677 (1979), the Court held that a private right of action existed to enforce Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373, as amended, 20 U.S.C.  1681 et seq. The reasoning of that decision embraced the existence of a private right to enforce Title VI as well. \"Title IX,\" the Court noted, \"was patterned after Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\" 441 U.S., at 694. And, \"[i]n 1972 when Title IX was enacted, the [parallel] language in Title VI had already been construed as creating a private remedy.\" Id., at 696. That meant, the Court reasoned, that Congress had intended Title IX, like Title VI, to provide a private cause of action. Id., at 699, 703, 710-711. Congress has since ratified Cannon's holding. Section 1003 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, 100 Stat. 1845, 42 U.S.C.  2000d-7, expressly abrogated States' sovereign immunity against suits brought in federal court to enforce Title VI and provided that in a suit against a State \"remedies (including remedies both at law and in equity) are available ... to the same extent as such remedies are available ... in the suit against any public or private entity other than a State,\" 2000d-7(a)(2). We recognized in Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U.S. 60 (1992), that 2000d-7 \"cannot be read except as a validation of Cannon's holding.\" Id., at 72; see also id., at 78 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (same). It is thus beyond dispute that private individuals may sue to enforce 601.~    ~    ~      6~      Second, it is similarly beyond dispute-and no party disagrees-that 601 prohibits only intentional discrimination. In Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978), the Court reviewed a decision of the California Supreme Court that had enjoined the University of California Medical School from \"according any consideration to race in its admissions process.\" Id., at 272. Essential to the Court's holding reversing that aspect of the California court's decision was the determination that 601 \"proscribe[s] only those racial classifications that would violate the Equal Protection Clause or the Fifth Amendment.\" Id., at 287 (opinion of Powell, J.); see also id., at 325, 328, 352 (opinion of Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ.). In Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City, 463 U.S. 582 (1983), the Court made clear that under Bakke only intentional discrimination was forbidden by 601. 463 U.S., at 610-611 (Powell, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 612 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 642 (Stevens, J., joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting). What we said in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 293 (1985), is true today: \"Title VI itself directly reach[es] only instances of intentional discrimination.\"1~    ~    ~      7~      Third, we must assume for purposes of deciding this case that regulations promulgated under 602 of Title VI may validly proscribe activities that have a disparate impact on racial groups, even though such activities are permissible under 601. Though no opinion of this Court has held that, five Justices in Guardians voiced that view of the law at least as alternative grounds for their decisions, see 463 U.S., at 591-592 (opinion of White, J.); id., at 623, n. 15 (Marshall, J., dissenting); id., at 643-645 (Stevens, J., joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting), and dictum in Alexander v. Choate is to the same effect, see 469 U.S., at 293, 295, n. 11. These statements are in considerable tension with the rule of Bakke and Guardians that 601 forbids only intentional discrimination, see, e.g., Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City, supra, at 612-613 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment), but petitioners have not challenged the regulations here. We therefore assume for the purposes of deciding this case that the DOJ and DOT regulations proscribing activities that have a disparate impact on the basis of race are valid.~    ~    ~      8~      Respondents assert that the issue in this case, like the first two described above, has been resolved by our cases. To reject a private cause of action to enforce the disparate-impact regulations, they say, we would \"[have] to ignore the actual language of Guardians and Cannon.\" Brief for Respondents 13. The language in Cannon to which respondents refer does not in fact support their position, as we shall discuss at length below, see infra, at 12-13. But in any event, this Court is bound by holdings, not language. Cannon was decided on the assumption that the University of Chicago had intentionally discriminated against petitioner. See 441 U.S., at 680 (noting that respondents \"admitted arguendo\" that petitioner's \"application for admission to medical school was denied by the respondents because she is a woman\"). It therefore held that Title IX created a private right of action to enforce its ban on intentional discrimination, but had no occasion to consider whether the right reached regulations barring disparate-impact discrimination.2 In Guardians, the Court held that private individuals could not recover compensatory damages under Title VI except for intentional discrimination. Five Justices in addition voted to uphold the disparate-impact regulations (four would have declared them invalid, see 463 U.S., at 611, n. 5 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 612-614 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment)), but of those five, three expressly reserved the question of a direct private right of action to enforce the regulations, saying that \"[w]hether a cause of action against private parties exists directly under the regulations ... [is a] questio[n] that [is] not presented by this case.\" Id., at 645, n. 18 (Stevens, J., dissenting).3 Thus, only two Justices had cause to reach the issue that respondents say the \"actual language\" of Guardians resolves. Neither that case,4 nor any other in this Court, has held that the private right of action exists.~    ~    ~      9~      Nor does it follow straightaway from the three points we have taken as given that Congress must have intended a private right of action to enforce disparate-impact regulations. We do not doubt that regulations applying 601's ban on intentional discrimination are covered by the cause of action to enforce that section. Such regulations, if valid and reasonable, authoritatively construe the statute itself, see NationsBank of N. C., N. A. v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., 513 U.S. 251, 257 (1995); Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843-844 (1984), and it is therefore meaningless to talk about a separate cause of action to enforce the regulations apart from the statute. A Congress that intends the statute to be enforced through a private cause of action intends the authoritative interpretation of the statute to be so enforced as well. The many cases that respondents say have \"assumed\" that a cause of action to enforce a statute includes one to enforce its regulations illustrate (to the extent that cases in which an issue was not presented can illustrate anything) only this point; each involved regulations of the type we have just described, as respondents conceded at oral argument, Tr. of Oral Arg. 33. See National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Smith, 525 U.S. 459, 468 (1999) (regulation defining who is a \"recipient\" under Title IX); School Bd. of Nassau Cty. v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 279-281 (1987) (regulations defining the terms \"physical impairment\" and \"major life activities\" in 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973); Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U.S. 385, 408-409 (1986) (White, J., joined by four other Justices, concurring) (regulation interpreting Title VI to require \"affirmative action\" remedying effects of intentional discrimination); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S., at 299, 309 (regulations clarifying what sorts of disparate impacts upon the handicapped were covered by 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which the Court assumed included some such impacts). Our decision in Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563 (1974), falls within the same category. The Title VI regulations at issue in Lau, similar to the ones at issue here, forbade funding recipients to take actions which had the effect of discriminating on the basis of race, color, or national origin. Id., at 568. Unlike our later cases, however, the Court in Lau interpreted 601 itself to proscribe disparate-impact discrimination, saying that it \"rel[ied] solely on 601 ... to reverse the Court of Appeals,\" id., at 566, and that the disparate-impact regulations simply \"[made] sure that recipients of federal aid ... conduct[ed] any federally financed projects consistently with 601,\" id., at 567.5~    ~    ~      10~      We must face now the question avoided by Lau, because we have since rejected Lau's interpretation of 601 as reaching beyond intentional discrimination. See supra, at 4. It is clear now that the disparate-impact regulations do not simply apply 601-since they indeed forbid conduct that 601 permits-and therefore clear that the private right of action to enforce 601 does not include a private right to enforce these regulations. See Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U.S. 164, 173 (1994) (a \"private plaintiff may not bring a [suit based on a regulation] against a defendant for acts not prohibited by the text of [the statute]\"). That right must come, if at all, from the independent force of 602. As stated earlier, we assume for purposes of this decision that 602 confers the authority to promulgate disparate-impact regulations6; the question remains whether it confers a private right of action to enforce them. If not, we must conclude that a failure to comply with regulations promulgated under 602 that is not also a failure to comply with 601 is not actionable.~    ~    ~      11~      Implicit in our discussion thus far has been a particular understanding of the genesis of private causes of action. Like substantive federal law itself, private rights of action to enforce federal law must be created by Congress. Touche Ross  Co. v. Redington, 442 U.S. 560, 578 (1979) (remedies available are those \"that Congress enacted into law\"). The judicial task is to interpret the statute Congress has passed to determine whether it displays an intent to create not just a private right but also a private remedy. Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U.S. 11, 15 (1979). Statutory intent on this latter point is determinative. See, e.g., Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, 501 U.S. 1083, 1102 (1991); Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson, 478 U.S. 804, 812, n. 9 (1986) (collecting cases). Without it, a cause of action does not exist and courts may not create one, no matter how desirable that might be as a policy matter, or how compatible with the statute. See, e.g., Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U.S. 134, 145, 148 (1985); Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, supra, at 23; Touche Ross  Co. v. Redington, supra, at 575-576. \"Raising up causes of action where a statute has not created them may be a proper function for common-law courts, but not for federal tribunals.\" Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis  Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U.S. 350, 365 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).~    ~    ~      12~      Respondents would have us revert in this case to the understanding of private causes of action that held sway 40 years ago when Title VI was enacted. That understanding is captured by the Court's statement in J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U.S. 426, 433 (1964), that \"it is the duty of the courts to be alert to provide such remedies as are necessary to make effective the congressional purpose\" expressed by a statute. We abandoned that understanding in Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66, 78 (1975)-which itself interpreted a statute enacted under the ancien regime-and have not returned to it since. Not even when interpreting the same Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that was at issue in Borak have we applied Borak's method for discerning and defining causes of action. See Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., supra, at 188; Musick, Peeler  Garrett v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, 508 U.S. 286, 291-293 (1993); Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, supra, at 1102-1103; Touche Ross  Co. v. Redington, supra, at 576-578. Having sworn off the habit of venturing beyond Congress's intent, we will not accept respondents' invitation to have one last drink.~    ~    ~      13~      Nor do we agree with the Government that our cases interpreting statutes enacted prior to Cort v. Ash have given \"dispositive weight\" to the \"expectations\" that the enacting Congress had formed \"in light of the 'contemporary legal context.' \" Brief for United States 14. Only three of our legion implied-right-of-action cases have found this sort of \"contemporary legal context\" relevant, and two of those involved Congress's enactment (or reenactment) of the verbatim statutory text that courts had previously interpreted to create a private right of action. See Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner  Smith, Inc. v. Curran, 456 U.S. 353, 378-379 (1982); Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S., at 698-699. In the third case, this sort of \"contemporary legal context\" simply buttressed a conclusion independently supported by the text of the statute. See Thompson v. Thompson, 484 U.S. 174 (1988). We have never accorded dispositive weight to context shorn of text. In determining whether statutes create private rights of action, as in interpreting statutes generally, see Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U.S. 775, 784 (1991), legal context matters only to the extent it clarifies text.~    ~    ~      14~      We therefore begin (and find that we can end) our search for Congress's intent with the text and structure of Title VI.7 Section 602 authorizes federal agencies \"to effectuate the provisions of [601] ... by issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability.\" 42 U.S.C.  2000d-1. It is immediately clear that the \"rights-creating\" language so critical to the Court's analysis in Cannon of 601, see 441 U.S., at 690 n. 13, is completely absent from 602. Whereas 601 decrees that \"[n]o person ... shall ... be subjected to discrimination,\" 42 U.S.C.  2000d the text of 602 provides that \"[e]ach Federal department and agency ... is authorized and directed to effectuate the provisions of [601],\" 42 U.S.C.  2000d-1. Far from displaying congressional intent to create new rights, 602 limits agencies to \"effectuat[ing]\" rights already created by 601. And the focus of 602 is twice removed from the individuals who will ultimately benefit from Title VI's protection. Statutes that focus on the person regulated rather than the individuals protected create \"no implication of an intent to confer rights on a particular class of persons.\" California v. Sierra Club, 451 U.S. 287, 294 (1981). Section 602 is yet a step further removed: it focuses neither on the individuals protected nor even on the funding recipients being regulated, but on the agencies that will do the regulating. Like the statute found not to create a right of action in Universities Research Assn., Inc. v. Coutu, 450 U.S. 754 (1981), 602 is \"phrased as a directive to federal agencies engaged in the distribution of public funds,\" id., at 772. When this is true, \"[t]here [is] far less reason to infer a private remedy in favor of individual persons,\" Cannon v. University of Chicago, supra, at 690-691. So far as we can tell, this authorizing portion of 602 reveals no congressional intent to create a private right of action.~    ~    ~      15~      Nor do the methods that 602 goes on to provide for enforcing its authorized regulations manifest an intent to create a private remedy; if anything, they suggest the opposite. Section 602 empowers agencies to enforce their regulations either by terminating funding to the \"particular program, or part thereof,\" that has violated the regulation or \"by any other means authorized by law,\" 42 U.S.C.  2000d-1. No enforcement action may be taken, however, \"until the department or agency concerned has advised the appropriate person or persons of the failure to comply with the requirement and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means.\" Ibid. And every agency enforcement action is subject to judicial review. 2000d-2. If an agency attempts to terminate program funding, still more restrictions apply. The agency head must \"file with the committees of the House and Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action.\" 2000d-1. And the termination of funding does not \"become effective until thirty days have elapsed after the filing of such report.\" Ibid. Whatever these elaborate restrictions on agency enforcement may imply for the private enforcement of rights created outside of 602, compare Cannon v. University of Chicago, supra, at 706, n. 41, 712, n. 49; Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S., at 419, n. 26 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), with Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City, 463 U.S., at 609-610 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment); Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, supra, at 382-383 (opinion of White, J.), they tend to contradict a congressional intent to create privately enforceable rights through 602 itself. The express provision of one method of enforcing a substantive rule suggests that Congress intended to preclude others. See, e.g., Karahalios v. Federal Employees, 489 U.S. 527, 533 (1989); Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers, 451 U.S. 77, 93-94 (1981); Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U.S., at 19-20. Sometimes the suggestion is so strong that it precludes a finding of congressional intent to create a private right of action, even though other aspects of the statute (such as language making the would-be plaintiff \"a member of the class for whose benefit the statute was enacted\") suggest the contrary. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U.S., at 145; see id., at 146-147. And as our Rev. Stat. 1979, 42 U.S.C.  1983 cases show, some remedial schemes foreclose a private cause of action to enforce even those statutes that admittedly create substantive private rights. See, e.g., Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Assn., 453 U.S. 1, 19-20 (1981). In the present case, the claim of exclusivity for the express remedial scheme does not even have to overcome such obstacles. The question whether 602's remedial scheme can overbear other evidence of congressional intent is simply not presented, since we have found no evidence anywhere in the text to suggest that Congress intended to create a private right to enforce regulations promulgated under 602.~    ~    ~      16~      Both the Government and respondents argue that the regulations contain rights-creating language and so must be privately enforceable, see Brief for United States 19-20; Brief for Respondents 31, but that argument skips an analytical step. Language in a regulation may invoke a private right of action that Congress through statutory text created, but it may not create a right that Congress has not. Touche Ross  Co. v. Redington, 442 U.S., at 577, n. 18 (\"[T]he language of the statute and not the rules must control\"). Thus, when a statute has provided a general authorization for private enforcement of regulations, it may perhaps be correct that the intent displayed in each regulation can determine whether or not it is privately enforceable. But it is most certainly incorrect to say that language in a regulation can conjure up a private cause of action that has not been authorized by Congress. Agencies may play the sorcerer's apprentice but not the sorcerer himself.~    ~    ~      17~      The last string to respondents' and the Government's bow is their argument that two amendments to Title VI \"ratified\" this Court's decisions finding an implied private right of action to enforce the disparate-impact regulations. See Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, 1003, 42 U.S.C.  2000d-7; Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, 6, 102 Stat. 31, 42 U.S.C.  2000d-4a. One problem with this argument is that, as explained above, none of our decisions establishes (or even assumes) the private right of action at issue here, see supra, at 5-8, which is why in Guardians three Justices were able expressly to reserve the question. See 463 U.S., at 645, n. 18 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Incorporating our cases in the amendments would thus not help respondents. Another problem is that the incorporation claim itself is flawed. Section 1003 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, on which only respondents rely, by its terms applies only to suits \"for a violation of a statute,\" 42 U.S.C.  2000d-7(a)(2) (emphasis added). It therefore does not speak to suits for violations of regulations that go beyond the statutory proscription of 601. Section 6 of the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 is even less on point. That provision amends Title VI to make the term \"program or activity\" cover larger portions of the institutions receiving federal financial aid than it had previously covered, see Grove City College v. Bell, 465 U.S. 555 (1984). It is impossible to understand what this has to do with implied causes of action-which is why we declared in Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U.S., at 73, that 6 did not \"in any way alte[r] the existing rights of action and the corresponding remedies permissible under ... Title VI.\" Respondents point to Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner  Smith, Inc. v. Curran, 456 U.S., at 381-382, which inferred congressional intent to ratify lower court decisions regarding a particular statutory provision when Congress comprehensively revised the statutory scheme but did not amend that provision. But we recently criticized Curran's reliance on congressional inaction, saying that \"[a]s a general matter ... [the] argumen[t] deserve[s] little weight in the interpretive process.\" Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U.S., at 187. And when, as here, Congress has not comprehensively revised a statutory scheme but has made only isolated amendments, we have spoken more bluntly: \"It is 'impossible to assert with any degree of assurance that congressional failure to act represents' affirmative congressional approval of the Court's statutory interpretation.\" Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 175, n. 1 (1989) (quoting Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara Cty., 480 U.S. 616, 671-672 (1987) (Scalia, J., dissenting)).~    ~    ~      18~      Neither as originally enacted nor as later amended does Title VI display an intent to create a freestanding private right of action to enforce regulations promulgated under 602.8 We therefore hold that no such right of action exists. Since we reach this conclusion applying our standard test for discerning private causes of action, we do not address petitioners' additional argument that implied causes of action against States (and perhaps nonfederal state actors generally) are inconsistent with the clear statement rule of Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1 (1981). See Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of Ed., 526 U.S. 629, 656-657, 684-685 (1999) (Kennedy, J., dissenting).~    ~    ~      19~      The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.~    ~    ~      20~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         Since the parties do not dispute this point, it is puzzling to see Justice Stevens go out of his way to disparage the decisions in Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978), and Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City, 463 U.S. 582 (1983), as \"somewhat haphazard,\" post, at 16, particularly since he had already accorded stare decisis effect to the former 18 years ago, see Guardians, 463 U.S., at 639-642 (dissenting opinion), and since he participated in creating the latter, see ibid. Nor does Justice Stevens' reliance on Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), see post, at 17-18, explain his aboutface, since he expressly reaffirms, see post, at 17-18, n. 18, the settled principle that decisions of this Court declaring the meaning of statutes prior to Chevron need not be reconsidered after Chevron in light of agency regulations that were already in force when our decisions were issued, Lechmere, Inc. v. NLRB, 502 U.S. 527, 536-537 (1992); Maislin Industries, U.S., Inc. v. Primary Steel, Inc., 497 U.S. 116, 131 (1990); see also Sullivan v. Everhart, 494 U.S. 83, 103-104, n. 6 (1990) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\"It is, of course, of no importance that [an opinion] predates Chevron ... . As we made clear in Chevron, the interpretive maxims summarized therein were 'well-settled principles' \").~      ~      ~        2~         Although the dissent acknowledges that \"the breadth of [Cannon's] precedent is a matter upon which reasonable jurists may differ,\" post, at 21, it disagrees with our reading of Cannon's holding because it thinks the distinction we draw between disparate-impact and intentional discrimination was \"wholly foreign\" to that opinion, see post, at 5. Cannon, however, was decided less than one year after the Court in Bakke had drawn precisely that distinction with respect to Title VI, see supra, at 4, and it is absurd to think that Cannon meant, without discussion, to ban under Title IX the very disparate-impact discrimination that Bakke said Title VI permitted. The only discussion in Cannon of Title IX's scope is found in Justice Powell's dissenting opinion, which simply assumed that the conclusion that Title IX would be limited to intentional discrimination was \"forgone in light of our holding\" in Bakke. Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 748, n. 19 (1979). The dissent's additional claim that Cannon provided a private right of action for \"all the discrimination prohibited by the regulatory scheme contained in Title IX,\" post, at 5, n. 4 (emphasis added), simply begs the question at the heart of this case, which is whether a right of action to enforce disparate-impact regulations must be independently identified, see infra, at 7-10.~      ~      ~        3~         We of course accept the statement by the author of the dissent that he \"thought\" at the time of Guardians that disparate-impact regulations could be enforced \"in an implied action against private parties,\" post, at 9, n. 6. But we have the better interpretation of what our colleague wrote in Guardians. In the closing section of his opinion, Justice Stevens concluded that because respondents in that case had \"violated the petitioners' rights under [the] regulations ... [t]he petitioners were therefore entitled to the compensation they sought under 42 U.S.C.  1983 and were awarded by the District Court.\" 463 U.S., at 645. The passage omits any mention of a direct private right of action to enforce the regulations, and the footnote we have quoted in text-which appears immediately after this concluding sentence, see id., at 645, n. 18-makes clear that the omission was not accidental.~      ~      ~        4~         Ultimately, the dissent agrees that \"the holding in Guardians does not compel the conclusion that a private right of action exists to enforce the Title VI regulations against private parties ... .\" Post, at 9.~      ~      ~        5~         It is true, as the dissent points out, see post, at 3-4, that three Justices who concurred in the result in Lau relied on regulations promulgated under 602 to support their position, see Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563, 570-571 (1974) (Stewart, J., concurring in result). But the five Justices who made up the majority did not, and their holding is not made coextensive with the concurrence because their opinion does not expressly preclude (is \"consistent with,\" see post, at 4) the concurrence's approach. The Court would be in an odd predicament if a concurring minority of the Justices could force the majority to address a point they found it unnecessary (and did not wish) to address, under compulsion of Justice Stevens' new principle that silence implies agreement.~      ~      ~        6~         For this reason, the dissent's extended discussion of the scope of agencies' regulatory authority under 602, see post, at 13-15, is beside the point. We cannot help observing, however, how strange it is to say that disparate-impact regulations are \"inspired by, at the service of, and inseparably intertwined with\" 601, post, at 15, when 601 permits the very behavior that the regulations forbid. See Guardians, 463 U.S., at 613 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (\"If, as five members of the Court concluded in Bakke, the purpose of Title VI is to proscribe only purposeful discrimination ... , regulations that would proscribe conduct by the recipient having only a discriminatory effect ... do not simply 'further' the purpose of Title VI; they go well beyond that purpose\").~      ~      ~        7~         Although the dissent claims that we \"adop[t] a methodology that blinds itself to important evidence of congressional intent,\" see post, at 21, our methodology is not novel, but well established in earlier decisions (including one authored by Justice Stevens, see Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers, 451 U.S. 77, 94, n. 31 (1981)), which explain that the interpretive inquiry begins with the text and structure of the statute, see id., at 91, and ends once it has become clear that Congress did not provide a cause of action.~      ~      ~        8~         The dissent complains that we \"offe[r] little affirmative support\" for this conclusion. Post, at 24. But as Justice Stevens has previously recognized in an opinion for the Court, \"affirmative\" evidence of congressional intent must be provided for an implied remedy, not against it, for without such intent \"the essential predicate for implication of a private remedy simply does not exist,\" Northwest Airlines, Inc., 451 U.S., at 94. The dissent's assertion that \"petitioners have marshaled substantial affirmative evidence that a private right of action exists to enforce Title VI and the regulations validly promulgated thereunder,\" post, at 24-25, n. 26 (second emphasis added), once again begs the question whether authorization of a private right of action to enforce a statute constitutes authorization of a private right of action to enforce regulations that go beyond what the statute itself requires.~      ~    ~    Stevens, J., dissenting~    ~      21~      Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.~    ~    ~      22~      In 1964, as part of a groundbreaking and comprehensive civil rights Act, Congress prohibited recipients of federal funds from discriminating on the basis of race, ethnicity, or national origin. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 252, 42 U.S.C.  2000d to 2000d-7. Pursuant to powers expressly delegated by that Act, the federal agencies and departments responsible for awarding and administering federal contracts immediately adopted regulations prohibiting federal contractees from adopting policies that have the \"effect\" of discriminating on those bases. At the time of the promulgation of these regulations, prevailing principles of statutory construction assumed that Congress intended a private right of action whenever such a cause of action was necessary to protect individual rights granted by valid federal law. Relying both on this presumption and on independent analysis of Title VI, this Court has repeatedly and consistently affirmed the right of private individuals to bring civil suits to enforce rights guaranteed by Title VI. A fair reading of those cases, and coherent implementation of the statutory scheme, requires the same result under Title VI's implementing regulations.~    ~    ~      23~      In separate lawsuits spanning several decades, we have endorsed an action identical in substance to the one brought in this case, see Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563 (1974); demonstrated that Congress intended a private right of action to protect the rights guaranteed by Title VI, see Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677 (1979); and concluded that private individuals may seek declaratory and injunctive relief against state officials for violations of regulations promulgated pursuant to Title VI, see Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City, 463 U.S. 582 (1983). Giving fair import to our language and our holdings, every Court of Appeals to address the question has concluded that a private right of action exists to enforce the rights guaranteed both by the text of Title VI and by any regulations validly promulgated pursuant to that Title, and Congress has adopted several statutes that appear to ratify the status quo.~    ~    ~      24~      Today, in a decision unfounded in our precedent and hostile to decades of settled expectations, a majority of this Court carves out an important exception to the right of private action long recognized under Title VI. In so doing, the Court makes three distinct, albeit interrelated, errors. First, the Court provides a muddled account of both the reasoning and the breadth of our prior decisions endorsing a private right of action under Title VI, thereby obscuring the conflict between those opinions and today's decision. Second, the Court offers a flawed and unconvincing analysis of the relationship between 601 and 602 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, ignoring more plausible and persuasive explanations detailed in our prior opinions. Finally, the Court badly misconstrues the theoretical linchpin of our decision in Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677 (1979), mistaking that decision's careful contextual analysis for judicial fiat.~    ~    ~      25~      * The majority is undoubtedly correct that this Court has never said in so many words that a private right of action exists to enforce the disparate-impact regulations promulgated under 602. However, the failure of our cases to state this conclusion explicitly does not absolve the Court of the responsibility to canvass our prior opinions for guidance. Reviewing these opinions with the care they deserve, I reach the same conclusion as the Courts of Appeals: This Court has already considered the question presented today and concluded that a private right of action exists.1~    ~    ~      26~      When this Court faced an identical case 27 years ago, all the Justices believed that private parties could bring lawsuits under Title VI and its implementing regulations to enjoin the provision of governmental services in a manner that discriminated against non-English speakers. See Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563 (1974). While five Justices saw no need to go beyond the command of 601, Chief Justice Burger, Justice Stewart, and Justice Blackmun relied specifically and exclusively on the regulations to support the private action, see id., at 569 (Stewart, J., concurring in result) (citing Mourning v. Family Publications Service, Inc., 411 U.S. 356, 369 (1973); Thorpe v. Housing Authority of Durham, 393 U.S. 268, 280-281 (1969)). There is nothing in the majority's opinion in Lau, or in earlier opinions of the Court, that is not fully consistent with the analysis of the concurring Justices or that would have differentiated between private actions to enforce the text of 601 and private actions to enforce the regulations promulgated pursuant to 602. See Guardians, 463 U.S., at 591 (principal opinion of White, J.) (describing this history and noting that, up to that point, no Justice had ever expressed disagreement with Justice Stewart's analysis in Lau).2~    ~    ~      27~      Five years later, we more explicitly considered whether a private right of action exists to enforce the guarantees of Title VI and its gender-based twin, Title IX. See Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677 (1979). In that case, we examined the text of the statutes, analyzed the purpose of the laws, and canvassed the relevant legislative history. Our conclusion was unequivocal: \"We have no doubt that Congress intended to create Title IX remedies comparable to those available under Title VI and that it understood Title VI as authorizing an implied private cause of action for victims of the prohibited discrimination.\" Id., at 703.~    ~    ~      28~      The majority acknowledges that Cannon is binding precedent with regard to both Title VI and Title IX, ante, at 3-4, but seeks to limit the scope of its holding to cases involving allegations of intentional discrimination. The distinction the majority attempts to impose is wholly foreign to Cannon's text and reasoning. The opinion in Cannon consistently treats the question presented in that case as whether a private right of action exists to enforce \"Title IX\" (and by extension \"Title VI\"),3 and does not draw any distinctions between the various types of discrimination outlawed by the operation of those statutes. Though the opinion did not reach out to affirmatively preclude the drawing of every conceivable distinction, it could hardly have been more clear as to the scope of its holding: A private right of action exists for \"victims of the prohibited discrimination.\" 441 U.S., at 703 (emphasis added). Not some of the prohibited discrimination, but all of it.4~    ~    ~      29~      Moreover, Cannon was itself a disparate-impact case. In that case, the plaintiff brought suit against two private universities challenging medical school admissions policies that set age limits for applicants. Plaintiff, a 39-year-old woman, alleged that these rules had the effect of discriminating against women because the incidence of interrupted higher education is higher among women than among men. In providing a shorthand description of her claim in the text of the opinion, we ambiguously stated that she had alleged that she was denied admission \"because she is a woman,\" but we appended a lengthy footnote setting forth the details of her disparate-impact claim. Other than the shorthand description of her claim, there is not a word in the text of the opinion even suggesting that she had made the improbable allegation that the University of Chicago and Northwestern University had intentionally discriminated against women. In the context of the entire opinion (including both its analysis and its uncontested description of the facts of the case), that single ambiguous phrase provides no basis for limiting the case's holding to incidents of intentional discrimination. If anything, the fact that the phrase \"because she is a woman\" encompasses both intentional and disparate-impact claims should have made it clear that the reasoning in the opinion was equally applicable to both types of claims. In any event, the holding of the case certainly applied to the disparate-impact claim that was described in detail in footnote 1 of the opinion, id., at 680.~    ~    ~      30~      Our fractured decision in Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City, 463 U.S. 582 (1983), reinforces the conclusion that this issue is effectively settled. While the various opinions in that case took different views as to the spectrum of relief available to plaintiffs in Title VI cases, a clear majority of the Court expressly stated that private parties may seek injunctive relief against governmental practices that have the effect of discriminating against racial and ethnic minorities. Id., at 594-595, 607 (White, J.); id., at 634 (Marshall, J., dissenting); id., at 638 (Stevens, J., joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting). As this case involves just such an action, its result ought to follow naturally from Guardians.~    ~    ~      31~      As I read today's opinion, the majority declines to accord precedential value to Guardians because the five Justices in the majority were arguably divided over the mechanism through which private parties might seek such injunctive relief.5 This argument inspires two responses. First, to the extent that the majority denies relief to the respondents merely because they neglected to mention 42 U.S.C.  1983 in framing their Title VI claim, this case is something of a sport. Litigants who in the future wish to enforce the Title VI regulations against state actors in all likelihood must only reference 1983 to obtain relief; indeed, the plaintiffs in this case (or other similarly situated individuals) presumably retain the option of re-challenging Alabama's English-only policy in a complaint that invokes 1983 even after today's decision.~    ~    ~      32~      More important, the majority's reading of Guardians is strained even in reference to the broader question whether injunctive relief is available to remedy violations of the Title VI regulations by nongovernmental grantees. As Guardians involved an action against a governmental entity, making 1983 relief available, the Court might have discussed the availability of judicial relief without addressing the scope of the implied private right of action available directly under Title VI. See 463 U. S., at 638 (Stevens, J.) (\"Even if it were not settled by now that Title VI authorizes appropriate relief, both prospective and retroactive, to victims of racial discrimination at the hands of recipients of federal funds, the same result would follow in this case because the petitioners have sought relief under 42 U.S.C.  1983\" (emphasis deleted)). However, the analysis in each of the relevant opinions did not do so.6 Rather than focusing on considerations specific to 1983, each of these opinions looked instead to our opinion in Cannon, to the intent of the Congress that adopted Title VI and the contemporaneous executive decisionmakers who crafted the Disparate-impact regulations, and to general principles of remediation.7~    ~    ~      33~      In summary, there is clear precedent of this Court for the proposition that the plaintiffs in this case can seek injunctive relief either through an implied right of action or through 1983. Though the holding in Guardians does not compel the conclusion that a private right of action exists to enforce the Title VI regulations against private parties, the rationales of the relevant opinions strongly imply that result. When that fact is coupled with our holding in Cannon and our unanimous decision in Lau, the answer to the question presented in this case is overdetermined.8 Even absent my continued belief that Congress intended a private right of action to enforce both Title VI and its implementing regulations, I would answer the question presented in the affirmative and affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals as a matter of stare decisis.9~    ~    II~    ~      34~      Underlying the majority's dismissive treatment of our prior cases is a flawed understanding of the structure of Title VI and, more particularly, of the relationship between 601 and 602. To some extent, confusion as to the relationship between the provisions is understandable, as Title VI is a deceptively simple statute. Section 601 of the Act lays out its straightforward commitment: \"No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" 42 U.S.C.  2000d. Section 602 \"authorize[s] and direct[s]\" all federal departments and agencies empowered to extend federal financial assistance to issue \"rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability\" in order to \"effectuate\" 601's antidiscrimination mandate. 42 U.S.C.  2000d-1.10~    ~    ~      35~      On the surface, the relationship between 601 and 602 is unproblematic-601 states a basic principle, 602 authorizes agencies to develop detailed plans for defining the contours of the principle and ensuring its enforcement. In the context of federal civil rights law, however, nothing is ever so simple. As actions to enforce 601's antidiscrimination principle have worked their way through the courts, we have developed a body of law giving content to 601's broadly worded commitment. E.g., United States v. Fordice, 505 U.S. 717, 732, n. 7 (1992); Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City, 463 U.S. 582 (1983); Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978). As the majority emphasizes today, the Judiciary's understanding of what conduct may be remedied in actions brought directly under 601 is, in certain ways, more circumscribed than the conduct prohibited by the regulations. See, e.g., ante, at 5.~    ~    ~      36~      Given that seeming peculiarity, it is necessary to examine closely the relationship between 601 and 602, in order to understand the purpose and import of the regulations at issue in this case. For the most part, however, the majority ignores this task, assuming that the judicial decisions interpreting 601 provide an authoritative interpretation of its true meaning and treating the regulations promulgated by the agencies charged with administering the statute as poor step-cousins-either parroting the text of 601 (in the case of regulations that prohibit intentional discrimination) or forwarding an agenda untethered to 601's mandate (in the case of disparate-impact regulations).~    ~    ~      37~      The majority's statutory analysis does violence to both the text and the structure of Title VI. Section 601 does not stand in isolation, but rather as part of an integrated remedial scheme. Section 602 exists for the sole purpose of forwarding the antidiscrimination ideals laid out in 601.11 The majority's persistent belief that the two sections somehow forward different agendas finds no support in the statute. Nor does Title VI anywhere suggest, let alone state, that for the purpose of determining their legal effect, the \"rules, regulations, [and] orders of general applicability\" adopted by the agencies are to be bifurcated by the judiciary into two categories based on how closely the courts believe the regulations track the text of 601.~    ~    ~      38~      What makes the Court's analysis even more troubling is that our cases have already adopted a simpler and more sensible model for understanding the relationship between the two sections. For three decades, we have treated 602 as granting the responsible agencies the power to issue broad prophylactic rules aimed at realizing the vision laid out in 601, even if the conduct captured by these rules is at times broader than that which would otherwise be prohibited.~    ~    ~      39~      In Lau, our first Title VI case, the only three Justices whose understanding of 601 required them to reach the question explicitly endorsed the power of the agencies to adopt broad prophylactic rules to enforce the aims of the statute. As Justice Stewart explained, regulations promulgated pursuant to 602 may \"go beyond . . . 601\" as long as they are \"reasonably related\" to its antidiscrimination mandate. 414 U.S., at 571 (Stewart, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Blackmun, J., concurring in result). In Guardians, at least three Members of the Court adopted a similar understanding of the statute. See 463 U.S., at 643 (Stevens, J., joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting). Finally, just 16 years ago, our unanimous opinion in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985), treated this understanding of Title VI's structure as settled law. Writing for the Court, Justice Marshall aptly explained the interpretation of 602's grant of regulatory power that necessarily underlies our prior caselaw: \"In essence, then, we [have] held that Title VI [has] delegated to the agencies in the first instance the complex determination of what sorts of disparate impacts upon minorities constituted sufficiently significant social problems, and [are] readily enough remediable, to warrant altering the practices of the federal grantees that ha[ve] produced those impacts.\" Id., at 293- 294.~    ~    ~      40~      This understanding is firmly rooted in the text of Title VI. As 602 explicitly states, the agencies are authorized to adopt regulations to \"effectuate\" 601's antidiscrimination mandate. 42 U.S.C.  2000d-1. The plain meaning of the text reveals Congress' intent to provide the relevant agencies with sufficient authority to transform the statute's broad aspiration into social reality. So too does a lengthy, consistent, and impassioned legislative history.12~    ~    ~      41~      This legislative design reflects a reasonable-indeed inspired-model for attacking the often-intractable problem of racial and ethnic discrimination. On its own terms, the statute supports an action challenging policies of federal grantees that explicitly or unambiguously violate antidiscrimination norms (such as policies that on their face limit benefits or services to certain races). With regard to more subtle forms of discrimination (such as schemes that limit benefits or services on ostensibly race-neutral grounds but have the predictable and perhaps intended consequence of materially benefiting some races at the expense of others), the statute does not establish a static approach but instead empowers the relevant agencies to evaluate social circumstances to determine whether there is a need for stronger measures.13 Such an approach builds into the law flexibility, an ability to make nuanced assessments of complex social realities, and an admirable willingness to credit the possibility of progress.~    ~    ~      42~      The \"effects\" regulations at issue in this case represent the considered judgment of the relevant agencies that discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, and national origin by federal contractees are significant social problems that might be remedied, or at least ameliorated, by the application of a broad prophylactic rule. Given the judgment underlying them, the regulations are inspired by, at the service of, and inseparably intertwined with 601's antidiscrimination mandate. Contrary to the majority's suggestion, they \"appl[y]\" 601's prohibition on discrimination just as surely as the intentional discrimination regulations the majority concedes are privately enforceable. Ante, at 7.~    ~    ~      43~      To the extent that our prior cases mischaracterize the relationship between 601 and 602, they err on the side of underestimating, not overestimating, the connection between the two provisions. While our cases have explicitly adopted an understanding of 601's scope that is somewhat narrower than the reach of the regulations,14 they have done so in an unorthodox and somewhat haphazard fashion.~    ~    ~      44~      Our conclusion that the legislation only encompasses intentional discrimination was never the subject of thorough consideration by a Court focused on that question. In Bakke, five Members of this Court concluded that 601 only prohibits race-based affirmative action programs in situations where the Equal Protection Clause would impose a similar ban. 438 U.S., at 287 (principal opinion of Powell, J.); id., at 325, 328, 352 (Brennan, J., joined by White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).15 In Guardians, the majority of the Court held that the analysis of those five Justices in Bakke compelled as a matter of stare decisis the conclusion that 601 does not on its own terms reach disparate impact cases. 463 U.S., at 610-611 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 612 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 642 (Stevens, J., joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ.). However, the opinions adopting that conclusion did not engage in any independent analysis of the reach of 601. Indeed, the only writing on this subject came from two of the five Members of the Bakke \"majority,\" each of whom wrote separately to reject the remaining Justices' understanding of their opinions in Bakke and to insist that 601 does in fact reach some instances of unintentional discrimination. 463 U.S., at 589-590 (White, J.); id., at 623-624 (Marshall, J., dissenting).16 The Court's occasional rote invocation of this Guardians majority in later cases ought not obscure the fact that the question whether 601 applies to disparate-impact claims has never been analyzed by this Court on the merits.17~    ~    ~      45~      In addition, these Title VI cases seemingly ignore the well-established principle of administrative law that is now most often described as the \"Chevron doctrine.\" See Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984). In most other contexts, when the agencies charged with administering a broadly-worded statute offer regulations interpreting that statute or giving concrete guidance as to its implementation, we treat their interpretation of the statute's breadth as controlling unless it presents an unreasonable construction of the statutory text. See ibid. While there may be some dispute as to the boundaries of Chevron deference, see, e.g., Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576 (2000), it is paradigmatically appropriate when Congress has clearly delegated agencies the power to issue regulations with the force of law and established formal procedures for the promulgation of such regulations.18~    ~    ~      46~      If we were writing on a blank slate, we might very well conclude that Chevron and similar cases decided both before and after Guardians provide the proper framework for understanding the structure of Title VI. Under such a reading there would be no incongruity between 601 and 602. Instead, we would read 602 as granting the federal agencies responsible for distributing federal funds the authority to issue regulations interpreting 601 on the assumption that their construction will-if reasonable-be incorporated into our understanding of 601's meaning.19~    ~    ~      47~      To resolve this case, however, it is unnecessary to answer the question whether our cases interpreting the reach of 601 should be reinterpreted in light of Chevron. If one understands the relationship between 601 and 602 through the prism of either Chevron or our prior Title VI cases, the question presented all but answers itself. If the regulations promulgated pursuant to 602 are either an authoritative construction of 601's meaning or prophylactic rules necessary to actualize the goals enunciated in 601, then it makes no sense to differentiate between private actions to enforce 601 and private actions to enforce 602. There is but one private action to enforce Title VI, and we already know that such an action exists.20 See Cannon, 441 U.S., at 703.~    ~    III~    ~      48~      The majority couples its flawed analysis of the structure of Title VI with an uncharitable understanding of the substance of the divide between those on this Court who are reluctant to interpret statutes to allow for private rights of action and those who are willing to do so if the claim of right survives a rigorous application of the criteria set forth in Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66 (1975). As the majority narrates our implied right of action jurisprudence, ante, at 10-11, the Court's shift to a more skeptical approach represents the rejection of a common-law judicial activism in favor of a principled recognition of the limited role of a contemporary \"federal tribunal.\" Ante, at 10. According to its analysis, the recognition of an implied right of action when the text and structure of the statute do not absolutely compel such a conclusion is an act of judicial self-indulgence. As much as we would like to help those disadvantaged by discrimination, we must resist the temptation to pour ourselves \"one last drink.\" Ante, at 11. To do otherwise would be to \"ventur[e] beyond Congress's intent.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      49~      Overwrought imagery aside, it is the majority's approach that blinds itself to congressional intent. While it remains true that, if Congress intends a private right of action to support statutory rights, \"the far better course is for it to specify as much when it creates those rights,\" Cannon, 441 U.S., at 717, its failure to do so does not absolve us of the responsibility to endeavor to discern its intent. In a series of cases since Cort v. Ash, we have laid out rules and developed strategies for this task.~    ~    ~      50~      The very existence of these rules and strategies assumes that we will sometimes find manifestations of an implicit intent to create such a right. Our decision in Cannon represents one such occasion. As the Cannon opinion iterated and reiterated, the question whether the plaintiff had a right of action that could be asserted in federal court was a \"question of statutory construction,\" 441 U. S, at 688, see also id., at 717 (Rehnquist, J., concurring), not a question of policy for the Court to decide. Applying the Cort v. Ash factors, we examined the nature of the rights at issue, the text and structure of the statute, and the relevant legislative history.21 Our conclusion was that Congress unmistakably intended a private right of action to enforce both Title IX and Title VI. Our reasoning-and, as I have demonstrated, our holding-was equally applicable to intentional discrimination and disparate impact claims.22~    ~    ~      51~      Underlying today's opinion is the conviction that Cannon must be cabined because it exemplifies an \"expansive rights-creating approach.\" Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U.S. 60, 77 (1992) (Scalia, J. concurring in judgment). But, as I have taken pains to explain, it was Congress, not the Court, that created the cause of action, and it was the Congress that later ratified the Cannon holding in 1986 and again in 1988. See 503 U.S., at 72-73.~    ~    ~      52~      In order to impose its own preferences as to the availability of judicial remedies, the Court today adopts a methodology that blinds itself to important evidence of congressional intent. It is one thing for the Court to ignore the import of our holding in Cannon, as the breadth of that precedent is a matter upon which reasonable jurists may differ. It is entirely another thing for the majority to ignore the reasoning of that opinion and the evidence contained therein, as those arguments and that evidence speak directly to the question at issue today. As I stated above, see n. 21, supra, Cannon carefully explained that both Title VI and Title IX were intended to benefit a particular class of individuals, that the purposes of the statutes would be furthered rather than frustrated by the implication of a private right of action, and that the legislative histories of the statutes support the conclusion that Congress intended such a right. See also Part IV, infra. Those conclusions and the evidence supporting them continue to have force today.~    ~    ~      53~      Similarly, if the majority is genuinely committed to deciphering congressional intent, its unwillingness to even consider evidence as to the context in which Congress legislated is perplexing. Congress does not legislate in a vacuum. As the respondent and the Government suggest, and as we have held several times, the objective manifestations of congressional intent to create a private right of action must be measured in light of the enacting Congress' expectations as to how the judiciary might evaluate the question. See Thompson v. Thompson, 484 U.S. 174 (1988); Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner  Smith, Inc. v. Curran, 456 U.S. 353, 378-379 (1982); Cannon, 441 U.S., at 698-699.23~    ~    ~      54~      At the time Congress was considering Title VI, it was normal practice for the courts to infer that Congress intended a private right of action whenever it passed a statute designed to protect a particular class that did not contain enforcement mechanisms which would be thwarted by a private remedy. See Merrill Lynch, 456 U.S., at 374-375 (discussing this history). Indeed, the very year Congress adopted Title VI, this Court specifically stated that \"it is the duty of the courts to be alert to provide such remedies as are necessary to make effective the congressional purpose.\" J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U.S. 426, 433 (1964). Assuming, as we must, that Congress was fully informed as to the state of the law, the contemporary context presents important evidence as to Congress' intent-evidence the majority declines to consider.~    ~    ~      55~      Ultimately, respect for Congress' prerogatives is measured in deeds, not words. Today, the Court coins a new rule, holding that a private cause of action to enforce a statute does not encompass a substantive regulation issued to effectuate that statute unless the regulation does nothing more than \"authoritatively construe the statute itself.\" Ante, at 7.24 This rule might be proper if we were the kind of \"common-law court\" the majority decries, ante, at 10, inventing private rights of action never intended by Congress. For if we are not construing a statute, we certainly may refuse to create a remedy for violations of federal regulations. But if we are faithful to the commitment to discerning congressional intent that all Members of this Court profess, the distinction is untenable. There is simply no reason to assume that Congress contemplated, desired, or adopted a distinction between regulations that merely parrot statutory text and broader regulations that are authorized by statutory text.25~    ~    IV~    ~      56~      Beyond its flawed structural analysis of Title VI and an evident antipathy toward implied rights of action, the majority offers little affirmative support for its conclusion that Congress did not intend to create a private remedy for violations of the Title VI regulations.26 The Court offers essentially two reasons for its position. First, it attaches significance to the fact that the \"rights-creating\" language in 601 that defines the classes protected by the statute is not repeated in 602. Ante, at 13-14. But, of course, there was no reason to put that language in 602 because it is perfectly obvious that the regulations authorized by 602 must be designed to protect precisely the same people protected by 601. Moreover, it is self-evident that, linguistic niceties notwithstanding, any statutory provision whose stated purpose is to \"effectuate\" the eradication of racial and ethnic discrimination has as its \"focus\" those individuals who, absent such legislation, would be subject to discrimination.~    ~    ~      57~      Second, the Court repeats the argument advanced and rejected in Cannon that the express provision of a fund cut-off remedy \"suggests that Congress intended to preclude others.\" Ante, at 14. In Cannon, 441 U.S., at 704-708, we carefully explained why the presence of an explicit mechanism to achieve one of the statute's objectives (ensuring that federal funds are not used \"to support discriminatory practices\") does not preclude a conclusion that a private right of action was intended to achieve the statute's other principal objective (\"to provide individual citizens effective protection against those practices\"). In support of our analysis, we offered policy arguments, cited evidence from the legislative history, and noted the active support of the relevant agencies. Ibid. In today's decision, the Court does not grapple with-indeed, barely acknowledges-our rejection of this argument in Cannon.~    ~    ~      58~      Like much else in its opinion, the present majority's unwillingness to explain its refusal to find the reasoning in Cannon persuasive suggests that today's decision is the unconscious product of the majority's profound distaste for implied causes of action rather than an attempt to discern the intent of the Congress that enacted Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Its colorful disclaimer of any interest in \"venturing beyond Congress's intent,\" ante, at 11, has a hollow ring.~    ~    V~    ~      59~      The question the Court answers today was only an open question in the most technical sense. Given the prevailing consensus in the Courts of Appeals, the Court should have declined to take this case. Having granted certiorari, the Court should have answered the question differently by simply according respect to our prior decisions. But most importantly, even if it were to ignore all of our post-1964 writing, the Court should have answered the question differently on the merits.~    ~    ~      60~      I respectfully dissent.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         Just about every Court of Appeals has either explicitly or implicitly held that a private right of action exists to enforce all of the regulations issued pursuant to Title VI, including the disparate-impact regulations. For decisions holding so most explicitly, see, e.g. Powell v. Ridge, 189 F.3d 387, 400 (CA3 1999); Chester Residents Concerned for Quality Living v. Seif, 132 F.3d 925, 936-937 (CA3 1997), summarily dism'd, 524 U.S. 974 (1998); David K. v. Lane, 839 F.2d 1265, 1274 (CA7 1988); Sandoval v. Hogan, 197 F.3d 484 (CA11 1999) (case below). See also Latinos Unidos De Chelsea v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, 799 F.2d 774, 785, n. 20 (CA1 1986); New York Urban League, Inc. v. New York, 71 F.3d 1031, 1036 (CA2 1995); Ferguson v. Charleston, 186 F.3d 469 (CA4 1999), rev'd on other grounds, 532 U.S. __ (2001); Castaneda v. Pickard, 781 F.2d 456, 465, n. 11 (CA5 1986); Buchanan v. Bolivar, 99 F.3d 1352, 1356, n. 5 (CA6 1996); Larry P.. v. Riles, 793 F.2d 969, 981-982 (CA9 1986); Villanueva v. Carere, 85 F.3d 481, 486 (CA10 1996). No Court of Appeals has ever reached a contrary conclusion. But cf. New York City Environmental Justice Alliance v. Giuliani, 214 F.3d 65, 72 (CA2 2000) (suggesting that the question may be open).~      ~      ~        2~         Indeed, it would have been remarkable if the majority had offered any disagreement with the concurring analysis as the concurring Justices grounded their argument in wellnbhyph;established principles for determining the availability of remedies under regulations, principles that all but one Member of the Court had endorsed the previous Term. See Mourning v. Family Publications Service, Inc., 411 U.S. 356, 369 (1973); id., at 378 (Douglas, J., joined by Stewart and Rehnquist, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (agreeing with the majority's analysis of the regulation in question); but see id., at 383, n. 1 (Powell, J., dissenting) (reserving analysis of the regulation's validity). The other decision the concurring Justices cited for this well-established principle was unanimous and only five years old. See Thorpe v. Housing Authority of Durham, 393 U.S. 268 (1969).~      ~      ~        3~         See Cannon, 441 U.S., at 687, 699, 702, n. 33, 703, 706, n. 40, 709.~      ~      ~        4~         The majority is undoubtedly correct that Cannon was not a case about the substance of Title IX but rather about the remedies available under that statute. Therefore, Cannon can not stand as a precedent for the proposition either that Title IX and its implementing regulations reach intentional discrimination or that they do not do so. What Cannon did hold is that all the discrimination prohibited by the regulatory scheme contained in Title IX may be the subject of a private lawsuit. As the Court today concedes that Cannon's holding applies to Title VI claims as well as Title IX claims, ante, at 3-4, and assumes that the regulations promulgated pursuant to 602 are validly promulgated antidiscrimination measures, ante, at 5, it is clear that today's opinion is in substantial tension with Cannon's reasoning and holding.~      ~      ~        5~         None of the relevant opinions was absolutely clear as to whether it envisioned such suits as being brought directly under the statute or under 42 U.S.C.  1983. However, a close reading of the opinions leaves little doubt that all of the Justices making up the Guardians majority contemplated the availability of private actions brought directly under the statute. Justice White fairly explicitly rested his conclusion on Cannon's holding that an implied right of action exists to enforce the terms of both Title VI and Title IX. Guardians, 463 U.S., at 594-595. Given that fact and the added consideration that his opinion appears to have equally contemplated suits against private and public parties, it is clear that he envisioned the availability of injunctive relief directly under the statute. Justice Marshall's opinion never mentions 1983 and refers simply to \"Title VI actions.\" Id., at 625. In addition, his opinion can only be read as contemplating suits on equal terms against both public and private grantees, thus also suggesting that he assumed such suits could be brought directly under the statute. That leaves my opinion. Like Justice White, I made it quite clear that I believed the right to sue to enforce the disparate-impact regulations followed directly from Cannon and, hence, was built directly into the statute. 463 U.S., at 635-636, and n. 1. However, I did also note that, in the alternative, relief would be available in that particular case under 1983.~      ~      ~        6~         The Court today cites one sentence in my final footnote in Guardians that it suggests is to the contrary. Ante, at 7 (citing 463 U.S., at 645, n. 18). However, the Court misreads that sentence. In his opinion in Guardians, Justice Powell had stated that he would affirm the judgment for the reasons stated in his dissent in Cannon, see 463 U.S., at 609-610 (opinion concurring in judgment), and that he would also hold that private actions asserting violations of Title VI could not be brought under 1983, id., at 610, and n. 3. One reason that he advanced in support of these conclusions was his view that the standard of proof in a 1983 action against public officials would differ from the standard in an action against private defendants. Id., at 608, n. 1. In a footnote at the end of my opinion, id., at 645, n. 18, I responded (perhaps inartfully) to Justice Powell. I noted that the fact that 1983 authorizes a lawsuit against the police department based on its violation of the governing administrative regulations did not mean, as Justice Powell had suggested, \"that a similar action would be unavailable against a similarly situated private party.\" Ibid. I added the sentence that the Court quotes today, ante at 7, not to reserve a question, but rather to explain that the record did not support Justice Powell's hypothesis regarding the standard of proof. I thought then, as I do now, that a violation of regulations adopted pursuant to Title VI may be established by proof of discriminatory impact in a 1983 action against state actors and also in an implied action against private parties. See n. 5, supra. Contrary to the Court's partial quotation of my opinion, see ante, at 7, n. 3, what I wrote amply reflected what I thought. See 463 U.S., at 635 (\"a private action against recipients of federal funds\"), id., at 636 (\"implied caus[e] of action\"); id., at 638 (\"Title VI authorizes appropriate relief\"). Justice Powell was quite correct in noting that it would be anomalous to assume that Congress would have intended to make it easier to recover from public officials than from private parties. That anomaly, however, does not seem to trouble the majority today.~      ~      ~        7~         See n. 5, supra.~      ~      ~        8~         See also Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U.S. 385 (1986) (per curiam) (adjudicating on the merits a claim brought under Title VI regulations).~      ~      ~        9~         The settled expectations the Court undercuts today derive not only from judicial decisions, but also from the consistent statements and actions of Congress. Congress' actions over the last two decades reflect a clear understanding of the existence of a private right action to enforce Title VI and its implementing regulations. In addition to numerous other small-scale amendments, Congress has twice adopted legislation expanding the reach of Title VI. See Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, 6, 102 Stat. 31 (codified at 42 U.S.C.  2000d-4a) (expanding definition of \"program\"); Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, 1003, 100 Stat. 1845 (codified at 42 U.S.C.  2000d-7) (explicitly abrogating States' Eleventh Amendment immunity in suits under Title VI). Both of these bills were adopted after this Court's decision in Lau, Cannon, and Guardians, and after most of the Courts of Appeals had affirmatively acknowledged an implied private right of action to enforce the disparate impact regulations. Their legislative histories explicitly reflect the fact that both proponents and opponents of the bills assumed that the full breadth of Title VI (including the disparate impact regulations promulgated pursuant to it) would be enforceable in private actions. See, e.g., Civil Rights Act of 1984: Hearings on S. 2658 before the Subcommittee. on the Constitution of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., 530 (1984) (memo from the Office of Management and Budget objecting to the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 because it would bring more entities within the scope of Title VI thereby subjecting them to \"private lawsuits\" to enforce the disparate impact regulations); id. at 532 (same memo warning of a proliferation of \"discriminatory effects\" suits by \"members of the bar\" acting as \"private Attorneys General\"); 134 Cong. Rec. 4257 (1988) (statement of Sen. Hatch) (arguing that the disparate impact regulations go too far and noting that that is a particular problem because \"[o]f course, advocacy groups will be able to bring private lawsuits making the same allegations before federal judges\"); see also Brief for United States 24, n. 16 (collecting testimony of academics advising Congress that private lawsuits were available to enforce the disparate impact regulations under existing precedent). Thus, this case goes well beyond the normal situation in which \"after a comprehensive reeaxmination and significant amendment\" Congress \"left intact the statutory provisions under which the federal courts had implied a private cause of action.\" Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner  Smith, Inc. v. Curran, 456 U.S. 353, 381-382 (1982). Here, there is no need to rest on presumptions of knowledge and ratification, because the direct evidence of Congress' understanding is plentiful.~      ~      ~        10~         The remainder of Title VI provides for judicial and administrative review of agency actions taken pursuant to the statute, 2000d-2; imposes certain limitations not at issue in this case, 2000d-3 to 2000d-4; and defines some of the terms found in the other provisions of the statute, 200d-4a.~      ~      ~        11~         See 42 U.S.C.  2000d-1 (602) (\"Each Federal department and agency which is empowered to extend Federal financial assistance ... is authorized and directed to effectuate the provisions of [601] ... by issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability\").~      ~      ~        12~         See, e.g., 110 Cong. Rec. 6543 (1964) (statement of Sen. Humphrey) (\"Simple justice requires that public funds, to which all taxpayers of all races contribute, not be spent in any fashion which encourages, entrenches, subsidizes, or results in racial discrimination\"); id., at 1520 (statement of Rep. Celler) (describing 602 as requiring federal agencies to \"reexamine\" their programs \"to make sure that adequate action has been taken to preclude ... discrimination\") .~      ~      ~        13~         It is important, in this context, to note that regulations prohibiting policies that have a disparate impact are not necessarily aimed only-or even primarily-at unintentional discrimination. Many policies whose very intent is to discriminate are framed in a race-neutral manner. It is often difficult to obtain direct evidence of this motivating animus. Therefore, an agency decision to adopt disparatenbhyph;impact regulations may very well reflect a determination by that agency that substantial intentional discrimination pervades the industry it is charged with regulating but that such discrimination is difficult to prove directly. As I have stated before: \"Frequently the most probative evidence of intent will be objective evidence of what actually happened rather than evidence describing the subjective state of mind of the actor.\" Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 253 (1976) (concurring opinion). On this reading, Title VI simply accords the agencies the power to decide whether or not to credit such evidence.~      ~      ~        14~         See, e.g., Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 293 (1985) (stating, in dicta, \"Title VI itself directly reach[es] only instances of intentional discrimination\"); Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City, 463 U.S. 582 (1983) (in separate opinions, seven Justices indicate that 601 on its face bars only intentional discrimination).~      ~      ~        15~         Of course, those five Justices divided over the application of the Equal Protection Clause-and by extension Title VI-to affirmative action cases. Therefore, it is somewhat strange to treat the opinions of those five Justices in Bakke as constituting a majority for any particular substantive interpretation of Title VI.~      ~      ~        16~         The fact that Justices Marshall and White both felt that the opinion they coauthored in Bakke did not resolve the question whether Title VI on its face reaches disparate-impact claims belies the majority's assertion that Bakke \"had drawn precisely that distinction,\" ante, at 6, n. 2, much less its implication that it would have been \"absurd\" to think otherwise, ibid.~      ~      ~        17~         In this context, it is worth noting that in a variety of other settings the Court has interpreted similarly ambiguous civil rights provisions to prohibit some policies based on their disparate impact on a protected group. See, e.g., Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 432 (1971) (Title VII); City of Rome v. United States, 446 U.S. 156, 172-173 (1980) (5 of the Voting Rights Act); cf. Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S., at 292-296 (explaining why the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which was modeled after 601, might be considered to reach some instances of disparate impact and then assuming that it does for purposes of deciding the case).~      ~      ~        18~         In relying on the Chevron doctrine, I do not mean to suggest that our decision in Chevron stated a new rule that requires the wholesale reconsideration of our statutory interpretation precedents. Instead, I continue to adhere to my position in Sullivan v. Everhart, 494 U.S. 83, 103-104, n. 6 (1990) (stating that Chevron merely summarized \"well-settled principles\"). In suggesting that, with regard to Title VI, we might reconsider whether our prior decisions gave sufficient deference to the agencies' interpretation of the statute, I do no more than question whether in this particular instance we paid sufficient consideration to those \"well-settled principles.\"~      ~      ~        19~         The legislative history strongly indicates that the Congress that adopted Title VI and the administration that proposed the statute intended that the agencies and departments would utilize the authority granted under 602 to shape the substantive contours of 601. For example, during the hearings that preceded the passage of the statute, Attorney General Kennedy agreed that the administrators of the various agencies would have the power to define \"what constitutes discrimination\" under Title VI and \"what acts or omissions are to be forbidden.\" Civil Rights-The Presidents Program, 1963: Hearings before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., 399-400 (1963); see also Civil Rights: Hearings before the House Committee on the Judiciary, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 4, p. 2740 (1963) (remarks of Attorney General Kennedy) (only after the agencies \"establish the rules\" will recipients \"understand what they can and cannot do\"). It was, in fact, concern for this broad delegation that inspired Congress to amend the pending bill to ensure that all regulations issued pursuant to Title VI would have to be approved by the President. See 42 U.S.C.  2000d-1 (laying out the requirement); 110 Cong. Rec. 2499 (1964) (remarks of Rep. Lindsay introducing the amendment). For further discussion of this legislative history, see Guardians, 463 U.S., at 615-624 (Marshall, J., dissenting); Abernathy, Title VI and the Constitution: A Regulatory Model for Defining \"Discrimination,\" 70 Geo. L. J. 1 (1981).~      ~      ~        20~         The majority twice suggests that I \"be[g] the question\" whether a private right of action to enforce Title VI necessarily encompasses a right of action to enforce the regulations validly promulgated pursuant to the statute. Ante, at 6, n. 2, 17, n. 8. As the above analysis demonstrates, I do no such thing. On the contrary, I demonstrate that the disparate-impact regulations promulgated pursuant to 602 are-and have always been considered to be-an important part of an integrated remedial scheme intended to promote the statute's antidiscrimination goals. Given that fact, there is simply no logical or legal justification for differentiating between actions to enforce the regulations and actions to enforce the statutory text. Furthermore, as my integrated approach reflects the longstanding practice of this Court, see n. 2, supra, it is the majority's largely unexplained assumption that a private right of action to enforce the disparate-impact regulations must be independently established that \"begs the question.\"~      ~      ~        21~         The text of the statute contained \"an unmistakable focus on the benefited class,\" 441 U.S., at 691; its legislative history \"rather plainly indicates that Congress intended to create such a remedy,\" id., at 694; the legislators' repeated references to private enforcement of Title VI reflected \"their intent with respect to Title IX,\" id., at 696-698; and the absence of legislative action to change the prevailing view with respect to Title VI left us with \"no doubt that Congress intended to create Title IX remedies comparable to those available under Title VI and that it understood Title VI as authorizing an implied private cause of action for victims of prohibited discrimination,\" id., at 703.~      ~      ~        22~         We should not overlook the fact that Cannon was decided after the Bakke majority had concluded that the coverage of Title VI was co-extensive with the coverage of the Equal Protection Clause.~      ~      ~        23~         Like any other type of evidence, contextual evidence may be trumped by other more persuasive evidence. Thus, the fact that, when evaluating older statutes, we have at times reached the conclusion that Congress did not imply a private right of action does not have the significance the majority suggests. Ante, at 13-14.~      ~      ~        24~         Only one of this Court's myriad private right of action cases even hints at such a rule. See Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U.S. 164, 173 (1994). Even that decision, however, does not fully support the majority's position for two important reasons. First, it is not at all clear that the majority opinion in that case simply held that the regulation in question could not be enforced by private action; the opinion also permits the reading, assumed by the dissent, that the majority was in effect invalidating the regulation in question. Id., at 200 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\"The majority leaves little doubt that the Exchange Act does not even permit the SEC to pursue aiders and abettors in civil enforcement actions under 10(b) and Rule 10b-5\"). Second, that case involved a right of action that the Court has forthrightly acknowledged was judicially created in exactly the way the majority now condemns. See, e.g., Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S. 723, 737 (1975) (describing private actions under Rule 10b-5 as \"a judicial oak which has grown from little more than a legislative acorn\"). As the action in question was in effect a common-law right, the Court was more within its rights to limit that remedy than it would be in a case, such as this one, where we have held that Congress clearly intended such a right.~      ~      ~        25~         See Guardians, 463 U.S., at 636 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\"It is one thing to conclude, as the Court did in Cannon, that the 1964 Congress, legislating when implied causes of action were the rule rather than the exception, reasonably assumed that the intended beneficiaries of Title VI would be able to vindicate their rights in court. It is quite another thing to believe that the 1964 Congress substantially qualified that assumption but thought it unnecessary to tell the Judiciary about the qualification\").~      ~      ~        26~         The majority suggests that its failure to offer such support is irrelevant, because the burden is on the party seeking to establish the existence of an implied right of action. Ante, at 17, n. 8. That response confuses apples and oranges. Undoubtedly, anyone seeking to bring a lawsuit has the burden of establishing that private individuals have the right to bring such a suit. However, once the courts have examined the statutory scheme under which the individual seeks to bring a suit and determined that a private right of action does exist, judges who seek to impose heretofore unrecognized limits on that right have a responsibility to offer reasoned arguments drawn from the text, structure, or history of that statute in order to justify such limitations. Moreover, in this case, the petitioners have marshaled substantial affirmative evidence that a private right of action exists to enforce Title VI and the regulations validly promulgated thereunder. See supra, at 21-22. It strikes me that it aids rather than hinders their case that this evidence is already summarized in an opinion of this Court. See Cannon, 441 U.S., at 691-703.~      ~    ~    ",

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.HUNT, GOVERNOR OF NORTH CAROLINA, et al.v.CROMARTIE et al.*~    No. 99-1864.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued November 27, 2000~    Decided April 18, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      After this Court found that North Carolina's legislature violated the Constitution by using race as the predominant factor in drawing its Twelfth Congressional District's 1992 boundaries, Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, the State redrew those boundaries. A three-judge District Court subsequently granted appellees summary judgment, finding that the new 1997 boundaries had also been created with racial considerations dominating all others. This Court reversed, finding that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the evidence was consistent with a race-based objective or the constitutional political objective of creating a safe Democratic seat. Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. 541. Among other things, this Court relied on evidence proposed to be submitted by appellants to conclude that, because the State's African-American voters overwhelmingly voted Democratic, one could not easily distinguish a legislative effort to create a majority-minority district from a legislative effort to create a safely Democratic one; that data showing voter registration did not indicate how voters would actually vote; and that data about actual behavior could affect the litigation's outcome. Id., at 547-551. On remand, the District Court again held, after a 3-day trial, that the legislature had used race driven criteria in drawing the 1997 boundaries. It based that conclusion on three findings-the district's shape, its splitting of towns and counties, and its heavily African-American voting population-that this Court had considered when it found summary judgment inappropriate, and on the new finding that the legislature had drawn the boundaries to collect precincts with a high racial, rather than political, identification.~      Held: The District Court's conclusion that the State violated the Equal Protection Clause in drawing the 1997 boundaries is based on clearly erroneous findings. Pp. 5-23.~      (a) The issue here is evidentiary: whether there is adequate support for the District Court's finding that race, rather than politics, drove the legislature's districting decision. Those attacking the district have the demanding burden of proof to show that a facially neutral law is unexplainable on grounds other than race. Cromartie, supra, at 546. Because the underlying districting decision falls within a legislature's sphere of competence, Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 915, courts must exercise extraordinary caution in adjudicating claims such as this one, id., at 916, especially where, as here, the State has articulated a legitimate political explanation for its districting decision and the voting population is one in which race and political affiliation are highly coordinated, see Cromartie, supra, at 551-552. This Court will review the District Court's findings only for \"clear error,\" asking whether \"on the entire evidence\" the Court is \"left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\" United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395. An extensive review of the District Court's findings is warranted here because there was no intermediate court review, the trial was not lengthy, the key evidence consisted primarily of documents and expert testimony, and credibility evaluations played a minor role. Pp. 5-7.~      (b) The critical District Court determination that \"race, not politics,\" predominantly explains the 1997 boundaries rests upon the three findings that this Court found insufficient to support summary judgment, and which cannot in and of themselves, as a matter of law, support the District Court's judgment here. See Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952, 968. Its determination also rests upon five new subsidiary findings, which this Court also cannot accept as adequate. First, the District Court primarily relied on evidence of voting registration, not voting behavior, which is precisely the kind of evidence that this Court found inadequate the last time the case was here. White registered Democrats \"cross-over\" to vote Republican more often than do African-Americans, who register and vote Democratic between 95% and 97% of the time. Thus, a legislature trying to secure a safe Democratic seat by placing reliable Democratic precincts within a district may end up with a district containing more heavily African-American precincts for political, not racial, reasons. Second, the evidence to which appellees' expert, Dr. Weber, pointed-that a reliably Democratic voting population of 60% is necessary to create a safe Democratic seat, but this district was 63% reliable; that certain white-Democratic precincts were excluded while African-American-Democratic precincts were included; that one precinct was split between Districts 9 and 12; and that other plans would have created a safely Democratic district with fewer African-American precincts-simply does not provide significant additional support for the District Court's conclusion. Also, portions of Dr. Weber's testimony not cited by the District Court undercut his conclusions. Third, the District Court, while not accepting the contrary conclusion of appellants' expert, Dr. Peterson, did not (and as far as the record reveals, could not) reject much of the significant supporting factual information he provided, which showed that African-American Democratic voters were more reliably Democratic and that District 12's boundaries were drawn to include reliable Democrats. Fourth, a statement about racial balance made by Senator Cooper, the legislative redistricting leader, shows that the legislature considered race along with other partisan and geographic considerations, but says little about whether race played a predominant role. And an e-mail sent by Gerry Cohen, a legislative staff member responsible for drafting districting plans, offers some support for the District Court's conclusion, but is less persuasive than the kinds of direct evidence that this Court has found significant in other redistricting cases. Fifth, appellees' maps summarizing voting behavior evidence tend to refute the District Court's \"race, not politics,\" conclusion. Pp. 7-22.~      (c) The modicum of evidence supporting the District Court's conclusion-the Cohen e-mail, Senator Cooper's statement, and some aspects of Dr. Weber's testimony-taken together, does not show that racial considerations predominated in the boundaries' drawing, because race in this case correlates closely with political behavior. Where majority-minority districts are at issue and racial identification correlates highly with political affiliation, the party attacking the boundaries must show at the least that the legislature could have achieved its legitimate political objectives in alternative ways that are comparably consistent with traditional districting principles and that those alternatives would have brought about significantly greater racial balance. Because appellees failed to make any such showing here, the District Court's contrary findings are clearly erroneous. Pp. 22-23.~      Reversed.~      ~        ~          NOTES:~        ~        ~          *~           Together with No. 99-1865, Smallwood et al. v. Cromartie et al., also on appeal from the same court.~        ~      ~      ON APPEALS FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA~      Breyer, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Stevens, O'Connor, Souter, and Ginsburg, JJ., joined. Thomas, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and Scalia and Kennedy, JJ., joined.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      In this appeal, we review a three-judge District Court's determination that North Carolina's legislature used race as the \"predominant factor\" in drawing its 12th Congressional District's 1997 boundaries. The court's findings, in our view, are clearly erroneous. We therefore reverse its conclusion that the State violated the Equal Protection Clause. U.S. Const., Amdt. 14, 1.~    ~    ~      2~      * This \"racial districting\" litigation is before us for the fourth time. Our first two holdings addressed North Carolina's former Congressional District 12, one of two North Carolina congressional districts drawn in 1992 that contained a majority of African-American voters. See Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630 (1993) (Shaw I); Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899 (1996) (Shaw II).~    ~    ~      3~      * In Shaw I, the Court considered whether plaintiffs' factual allegation-that the legislature had drawn the former district's boundaries for race-based reasons-if true, could underlie a legal holding that the legislature had violated the Equal Protection Clause. The Court held that it could. It wrote that a violation may exist where the legislature's boundary drawing, though \"race neutral on its face,\" nonetheless can be understood only as an effort to \"separate voters into different districts on the basis of race,\" and where the \"separation lacks sufficient justification.\" 509 U.S., at 649.~    ~    ~      4~      In Shaw II, the Court reversed a subsequent three-judge District Court's holding that the boundary-drawing law in question did not violate the Constitution. This Court found that the district's \"unconventional,\" snakelike shape, the way in which its boundaries split towns and counties, its predominately African-American racial make-up, and its history, together demonstrated a deliberate effort to create a \"majority-black\" district in which race \"could not be compromised,\" not simply a district designed to \"protec[t] Democratic incumbents.\" 517 U.S., at 902-903, 905-907. And the Court concluded that the legislature's use of racial criteria was not justified. Id., at 909-918.~    ~    B~    ~      5~      Our third holding focused on a new District 12, the boundaries of which the legislature had redrawn in 1997. Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. 541 (1999). A three-judge District Court, with one judge dissenting, had granted summary judgment in favor of those challenging the district's boundaries. The court found that the legislature again had \"used criteria . . . that are facially race driven,\" in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. App. to Juris. Statement 262a. It based this conclusion upon \"uncontroverted material facts\" showing that the boundaries created an unusually shaped district, split counties and cities, and in particular placed almost all heavily Democratic-registered, predominantly African-American voting precincts, inside the district while locating some heavily Democratic-registered, predominantly white precincts, outside the district. This latter circumstance, said the court, showed that the legislature was trying to maximize new District 12's African-American voting strength, not the district's Democratic voting strength. Ibid.~    ~    ~      6~      This Court reversed. We agreed with the District Court that the new district's shape, the way in which it split towns and counties, and its heavily African-American voting population all helped the plaintiffs' case. 526 U.S., at 547-549. But neither that evidence by itself, nor when coupled with the evidence of Democratic registration, was sufficient to show, on summary judgment, the unconstitutional race-based objective that plaintiffs claimed. That is because there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the evidence also was consistent with a constitutional political objective, namely, the creation of a safe Democratic seat. Id., at 549-551.~    ~    ~      7~      We pointed to the affidavit of an expert witness for defendants, Dr. David W. Peterson. Dr. Peterson offered to show that, because North Carolina's African-American voters are overwhelmingly Democratic voters, one cannot easily distinguish a legislative effort to create a majority-African-American district from a legislative effort to create a safely Democratic district. Id., at 550. And he also provided data showing that registration did not indicate how voters would actually vote. Id., at 550-551. We agreed that data showing how voters actually behave, not data showing only how those voters are registered, could affect the outcome of this litigation. Ibid. We concluded that the case was \"not suited for summary disposition\" and we reversed the District Court. Id., at 554.~    ~    C~    ~      8~      On remand, the parties undertook additional discovery. The three-judge District Court held a 3-day trial. And the court again held (over a dissent) that the legislature had unconstitutionally drawn District 12's new 1997 boundaries. It found that the legislature had tried \"(1) [to] cur[e] the [previous district's] constitutional defects\" while also \"(2) drawing the plan to maintain the existing partisan balance in the State's congressional delegation.\" App. to Juris. Statement 11a. It added that to \"achieve the second goal,\" the legislature \"drew the new plan (1) to avoid placing two incumbents in the same district and (2) to preserve the partisan core of the existing districts.\" Ibid. The court concluded that the \"plan as enacted largely reflects these directives.\" Ibid. But the court also found \"as a matter of fact that the General Assembly . . . used criteria . . . that are facially race driven\" without any compelling justification for doing so. Id., at 28a.~    ~    ~      9~      The court based its latter, constitutionally critical, conclusion in part upon the district's snakelike shape, the way in which it split cities and towns, and its heavily African-American (47%) voting population, id., at 11a-17a-all matters that this Court had considered when it found summary judgment inappropriate, Cromartie, supra, at 544. The court also based this conclusion upon a specific finding-absent when we previously considered this litigation-that the legislature had drawn the boundaries in order \"to collect precincts with high racial identification rather than political identification.\" App. to Juris. Statement 28a-29a (emphasis added).~    ~    ~      10~      This last-mentioned finding rested in turn upon five subsidiary determinations:~    ~    ~      11~      (1) that \"the legislators excluded many heavily-Democratic precincts from District 12, even when those precincts immediately border the Twelfth and would have established a far more compact district,\" id., at 25a; see also id., at 29a (\"more heavily Democratic precincts ... were bypassed ... in favor of precincts with a higher African-American population\");~    ~    ~      12~      (2) that \"[a]dditionally, Plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Weber, showed time and again how race trumped party affiliation in the construction of the 12th District and how political explanations utterly failed to explain the composition of the district,\" id., at 26a;~    ~    ~      13~      (3) that Dr. Peterson's testimony was \" 'unreliable' and not relevant,\" id., at 27a (citing testimony of Dr. Weber);~    ~    ~      14~      (4) that a legislative redistricting leader, Senator Roy Cooper, had alluded at the time of redistricting \"to a need for 'racial and partisan' balance,\" ibid.; and~    ~    ~      15~      (5) that the Senate's redistricting coordinator, Gerry Cohen, had sent Senator Cooper an e-mail reporting that Cooper had \"moved Greensboro Black community into the 12th, and now need[ed] to take [about] 60,000 out of the 12th,\" App. 369; App. to Juris. Statement 27a-28a.~    ~    ~      16~      The State and intervenors filed a notice of appeal. 28 U.S.C.  1253. We noted probable jurisdiction. 530 U.S. 1260 (2000). And we now reverse.~    ~    II~    ~      17~      The issue in this case is evidentiary. We must determine whether there is adequate support for the District Court's key findings, particularly the ultimate finding that the legislature's motive was predominantly racial, not political. In making this determination, we are aware that, under Shaw I and later cases, the burden of proof on the plaintiffs (who attack the district) is a \"demanding one.\" Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 928 (1995) (O'Connor, J., concurring). The Court has specified that those who claim that a legislature has improperly used race as a criterion, in order, for example, to create a majority-minority district, must show at a minimum that the \"legislature subordinated traditional race-neutral districting principles . . . to racial considerations.\" Id., at 916 (majority opinion). Race must not simply have been \"a motivation for the drawing of a majority minority district,\" Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952, 959 (1996) (O'Connor, J., principal opinion) (emphasis in original), but \"the 'predominant factor' motivating the legislature's districting decision,\" Cromartie, 526 U.S., at 547 (quoting Miller, supra, at 916) (emphasis added). Plaintiffs must show that a facially neutral law \" 'is \"unexplainable on grounds other than race.\" ' \" Cromartie, supra, at 546 (quoting Shaw I, 509 U.S., at 644, in turn quoting Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 266 (1977)).   The Court also has made clear that the underlying districting decision is one that ordinarily falls within a legislature's sphere of competence. Miller, 515 U.S., at 915. Hence, the legislature \"must have discretion to exercise the political judgment necessary to balance competing interests,\" ibid., and courts must \"exercise extraordinary caution in adjudicating claims that a State has drawn district lines on the basis of race,\" id., at 916 (emphasis added). Caution is especially appropriate in this case, where the State has articulated a legitimate political explanation for its districting decision, and the voting population is one in which race and political affiliation are highly correlated. See Cromartie, supra, at 551-552 (noting that \"[e]vidence that blacks constitute even a supermajority in one congressional district while amounting to less than a plurality in a neighboring district will not, by itself, suffice to prove that a jurisdiction was motivated by race in drawing its district lines when the evidence also shows a high correlation between race and party preference\").~    ~    ~      18~      We also are aware that we review the District Court's findings only for \"clear error.\" In applying this standard, we, like any reviewing court, will not reverse a lower court's finding of fact simply because we \"would have decided the case differently.\" Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573 (1985). Rather, a reviewing court must ask whether \"on the entire evidence,\" it is \"left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\" United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395 (1948).~    ~    ~      19~      Where an intermediate court reviews, and affirms, a trial court's factual findings, this Court will not \"lightly overturn\" the concurrent findings of the two lower courts. E.g., Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 193, n. 3 (1972). But in this instance there is no intermediate court, and we are the only court of review. Moreover, the trial here at issue was not lengthy and the key evidence consisted primarily of documents and expert testimony. Credibility evaluations played a minor role. Accordingly, we find that an extensive review of the District Court's findings, for clear error, is warranted. See Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 500-501 (1984). That review leaves us \"with the definite and firm conviction,\" United States Gypsum Co., supra, at 395, that the District Court's key findings are mistaken.~    ~    III~    ~      20~      The critical District Court determination-the matter for which we remanded this litigation-consists of the finding that race rather than politics predominantly explains District 12's 1997 boundaries. That determination rests upon three findings (the district's shape, its splitting of towns and counties, and its high African-American voting population) that we previously found insufficient to support summary judgment. Cromartie, supra, at 547-549. Given the undisputed evidence that racial identification is highly correlated with political affiliation in North Carolina, these facts in and of themselves cannot, as a matter of law, support the District Court's judgment. See Vera, 517 U.S., at 968 (O'Connor, J., principal opinion) (\"If district lines merely correlate with race because they are drawn on the basis of political affiliation, which correlates with race, there is no racial classification to justify\"). The District Court rested, however, upon five new subsidiary findings to conclude that District 12's lines are the product of no \"mer[e] correlat[ion],\" ibid., but are instead a result of the predominance of race in the legislature's line-drawing process. See supra, at 5.~    ~    ~      21~      In considering each subsidiary finding, we have given weight to the fact that the District Court was familiar with this litigation, heard the testimony of each witness, and considered all the evidence with care. Nonetheless, we cannot accept the District Court's findings as adequate for reasons which we shall spell out in detail and which we can summarize as follows:~    ~    ~      22~      First, the primary evidence upon which the District Court relied for its \"race, not politics,\" conclusion is evidence of voting registration, not voting behavior; and that is precisely the kind of evidence that we said was inadequate the last time this case was before us. See infra, at 9-10. Second, the additional evidence to which appellees' expert, Dr. Weber, pointed, and the statements made by Senator Cooper and Gerry Cohen, simply do not provide significant additional support for the District Court's conclusion. See infra, at 10-15, 17-19. Third, the District Court, while not accepting the contrary conclusion of appellants' expert, Dr. Peterson, did not (and as far as the record reveals, could not) reject much of the significant supporting factual information he provided. See infra, at 15-17. Fourth, in any event, appellees themselves have provided us with charts summarizing evidence of voting behavior and those charts tend to refute the court's \"race not politics\" conclusion. See infra, at 19-21; Appendixes, infra.~    ~    ~      23~      * The District Court primarily based its \"race, not politics,\" conclusion upon its finding that \"the legislators excluded many heavily-Democratic precincts from District 12, even when those precincts immediately border the Twelfth and would have established a far more compact district.\" App. to Juris. Statement 25a; see also id., at 29a (\"[M]ore heavily Democratic precincts ... were bypassed ... in favor of precincts with a higher African-American population\"). This finding, however-insofar as it differs from the remaining four-rests solely upon evidence that the legislature excluded heavily white precincts with high Democratic Party registration, while including heavily African-American precincts with equivalent, or lower, Democratic Party registration. See id., at 13a-14a, 17a. Indeed, the District Court cites at length figures showing that the legislature included \"several precincts with racial compositions of 40 to 100 percent African-American,\" while excluding certain adjacent precincts \"with less than 35 percent African-American population\" but which contain between 54% and 76% registered Democrats. Id., at 13a-14a.~    ~    ~      24~      As we said before, the problem with this evidence is that it focuses upon party registration, not upon voting behavior. And we previously found the same evidence, compare ibid. (District Court's opinion after trial) with id., at 249a-250a (District Court's summary judgment opinion), inadequate because registration figures do not accurately predict preference at the polls. See id., at 174a; see also Cromartie, 526 U.S., at 550-551 (describing Dr. Peterson's analysis as \"more thorough\" because in North Carolina, \"party registration and party preference do not always correspond\"). In part this is because white voters registered as Democrats \"cross-over\" to vote for a Republican candidate more often than do African-Americans, who register and vote Democratic between 95% and 97% of the time. See Record, Deposition of Gerry Cohen 37-42 (discussing data); App. 304 (stating that white voters cast about 60% to 70% of their votes for Republican candidates); id., at 139 (Dr. Weber's testimony that 95% to 97% of African-Americans register and vote as Democrats); see also id., at 118 (testimony by Dr. Weber that registration data were the least reliable information upon which to predict voter behavior). A legislature trying to secure a safe Democratic seat is interested in Democratic voting behavior. Hence, a legislature may, by placing reliable Democratic precincts within a district without regard to race, end up with a district containing more heavily African-American precincts, but the reasons would be political rather than racial.~    ~    ~      25~      Insofar as the District Court relied upon voting registration data, particularly data that were previously before us, it tells us nothing new; and the data do not help answer the question posed when we previously remanded this litigation. Cromartie, supra, at 551.~    ~    B~    ~      26~      The District Court wrote that \"[a]dditionally, [p]laintiffs' expert, Dr. Weber, showed time and again how race trumped party affiliation in the construction of the 12th District and how political explanations utterly failed to explain the composition of the district.\" App. to Juris. Statement 26a. In support of this conclusion, the court relied upon six different citations to Dr. Weber's trial testimony. We have examined each reference.~    ~    ~      27~      * At the first cited pages of the trial transcript, Dr. Weber says that a reliably Democratic voting population of 60% is sufficient to create a safe Democratic seat. App. 91. Yet, he adds, the legislature created a more-than-60% reliable Democratic voting population in District 12. Hence (we read Dr. Weber to infer), the legislature likely was driven by race, not politics. Tr. 163; App. 314-315.~    ~    ~      28~      The record indicates, however, that, although Dr. Weber is right that District 12 is more than 60% reliably Democratic, it exceeds that figure by very little. Nor did Dr. Weber ask whether other districts, unchallenged by appellees, were significantly less \"safe\" than was District 12. Id., at 148. In fact the figures the legislature used showed that District 12 would be 63% reliably Democratic. App. to Juris. Statement 80a (Democratic vote over three representative elections averaged 63%). By the same measures, at least two Republican districts (Districts 6 and 10) are 61% reliably Republican. Ibid. And, as Dr. Weber conceded, incumbents might have urged legislators (trying to maintain a six/six Democrat/Republican delegation split) to make their seats, not 60% safe, but as safe as possible. App. 149. In a field such as voting behavior, where figures are inherently uncertain, Dr. Weber's tiny calculated percentage differences are simply too small to carry significant evidentiary weight.~    ~    2~    ~      29~      The District Court cited two parts of the transcript where Dr. Weber testified about a table he had prepared listing all precincts in the six counties, portions of which make up District 12. Tr. 204-205, 262. Dr. Weber said that District 12 contains between 39% and 56% of the precincts (depending on the county) that are more-than-40% reliably Democratic, but it contains almost every precinct with more-than-40% African-American voters. Id., at 204-205. Why, he essentially asks, if the legislature had had politics primarily in mind, would its effort to place reliably Democratic precincts within District 12 not have produced a greater racial mixture?~    ~    ~      30~      Dr. Weber's own testimony provides an answer to this question. As Dr. Weber agreed, the precincts listed in the table were at least 40% reliably Democratic, but virtually all the African-American precincts included in District 12 were more than 40% reliably Democratic. Moreover, none of the excluded white precincts were as reliably Democratic as the African-American precincts that were included in the district. App. 140. Yet the legislature sought precincts that were reliably Democratic, not precincts that were 40%-reliably Democratic, for obvious political reasons.~    ~    ~      31~      Neither does the table specify whether the excluded white-reliably-Democratic precincts were located near enough to District 12's boundaries or each other for the legislature as a practical matter to have drawn District 12's boundaries to have included them, without sacrificing other important political goals. The contrary is suggested by the fact that Dr. Weber's own proposed alternative plan, see id., at 106-107, would have pitted two incumbents against each other (Sue Myrick, a Republican from former District 9 and Mel Watt, a Democrat from former District 12). Dr. Weber testified that such a result-\"a very competitive race with one of them losing their seat\"-was desirable. Id., at 153. But the legislature, for political, not racial, reasons, believed the opposite. And it drew its plan to protect incumbents-a legitimate political goal recognized by the District Court. App. to Juris. Statement 11a.~    ~    ~      32~      For these reasons, Dr. Weber's table offers little insight into the legislature's true motive.~    ~    3~    ~      33~      The next part of the transcript the District Court cited contains Dr. Weber's testimony about a Mecklenburg County precinct (precinct 77) which the legislature split between Districts 9 and 12. Tr. 221. Dr. Weber apparently thought that the legislature did not have to split this precinct, placing the more heavily African-American segment within District 12-unless, of course, its motive was racial rather than political. But Dr. Weber simultaneously conceded that he had not considered whether District 9's incumbent Republican would have wanted the whole of precinct 77 left in her own district where it would have burdened her with a significant additional number of reliably Democratic voters. App. 156-157. Nor had Dr. Weber \"test[ed]\" his conclusion that this split helped to show a racial (rather than political) motive, say, by adjusting other boundary lines and determining the political, or other nonracial, consequences of such adjustments. Id., at 132.~    ~    ~      34~      The maps in evidence indicate that to have placed all of precinct 77 within District 12 would have created a District 12 peninsula that invaded District 9, neatly dividing that latter district in two, see id., at 496-a conclusive nonracial reason for the legislature's decision not to do so.~    ~    4~    ~      35~      The District Court cited Dr. Weber's conclusion that \"race is the predominant factor.\" Tr. 251. But this statement of the conclusion is no stronger than the evidence that underlies it.~    ~    5~    ~      36~      The District Court's final citation is to Dr. Weber's assertion that there are other ways in which the legislature could have created a safely Democratic district without placing so many primarily African-American districts within District 12. Id., at 288. And we recognize that some such other ways may exist. But, unless the evidence also shows that these hypothetical alternative districts would have better satisfied the legislature's other nonracial political goals as well as traditional nonracial districting principles, this fact alone cannot show an improper legislative motive. After all, the Constitution does not place an affirmative obligation upon the legislature to avoid creating districts that turn out to be heavily, even majority, minority. It simply imposes an obligation not to create such districts for predominantly racial, as opposed to political or traditional, districting motivations. And Dr. Weber's testimony does not, at the pages cited, provide evidence of a politically practical alternative plan that the legislature failed to adopt predominantly for racial reasons.~    ~    6~    ~      37~      In addition, we have read the whole of Dr. Weber's testimony, including portions not cited by the District Court. Some of those portions further undercut Dr. Weber's conclusions. Dr. Weber said, for example, that he had developed those conclusions while under the erroneous impression that the legislature's computer-based districting program provided information about racial, but not political, balance. App. 137-138; see also id., at 302 (reflecting Dr. Weber's erroneous impression in the declaration he submitted to the District Court). He also said he was not aware of \"anything about political dynamics going on in the [l]egislature involving\" District 12, id., at 135, sometimes expressing disdain for a process that we have cautioned courts to respect, id., at 150-151; Miller, 515 U.S., at 915-916.~    ~    ~      38~      Other portions support Dr. Weber's conclusions. Dr. Weber testified, for example, about a different alternative plan that, in his view, would have provided both greater racial balance and political security, namely, a plan that the legislature did enact in 1998, and which has been in effect during the time the courts have been reviewing the constitutionality of the 1997 plan. App. 156-157. The existence of this alternative plan, however, cannot help appellees significantly. Although it created a somewhat more compact district, it still divides many communities along racial lines, while providing fewer reliably Democratic District 12 voters and transferring a group of highly Democratic precincts into two safely Republican districts, namely, the 5th and 6th Districts, which political result the 1997 plan sought to avoid. See Tr. 352, 355. Furthermore, the 1997 plan before this Court, unlike the 1998 plan, joined three major cities in a manner legislators regarded as reflecting \"a real commonality of urban interests, with inner city schools, urban health care ... problems, public housing problems.\" App. 430 (statement of Sen. Winner); see also id., at 421 (statement of Sen. Martin). Consequently, we cannot tell whether the existence of the 1998 plan shows that the 1997 plan was drawn with racial considerations predominant. And, in any event, the District Court did not rely upon the existence of the 1998 plan to support its ultimate conclusion. See Kelley v. Everglades Drainage Dist., 319 U.S. 415, 420-422 (1943) (per curiam).~    ~    ~      39~      We do not see how Dr. Weber's testimony, taken as a whole, could have provided more than minimal support for the District Court's conclusion that race predominantly underlay the legislature's districting decision.~    ~    C~    ~      40~      The District Court found that the testimony of the State's primary expert, Dr. Peterson, was \" 'unreliable' and not relevant.\" App. to Juris. Statement 27a (quoting Dr. Weber and citing Tr. 222-224, 232). Dr. Peterson's testimony was designed to show that African-American Democratic voters were more reliably Democratic and that District 12's boundaries were drawn to include reliable Democrats. Specifically, Dr. Peterson compared precincts immediately within District 12 and those immediately without to determine whether the boundaries of the district corresponded better with race than with politics. The principle underlying Dr. Peterson's analysis is that if the district were drawn with race predominantly in mind, one would expect the boundaries of the district to correlate with race more than with politics.~    ~    ~      41~      The pages cited in support of the District Court's rejection of Dr. Peterson's conclusions contain testimony by Dr. Weber, who says that Dr. Peterson's analysis is unreliable because (1) it \"ignor[es] the core\" of the district, id., at 223, and (2) it fails to take account of the fact that different precincts have different populations, id., at 223-224. The first matter-ignoring the \"core\"-apparently reflects Dr. Weber's view that in context the fact that District 12's heart or \"core\" is heavily African-American by itself shows that the legislature's motive was predominantly racial, not political. The District Court did not argue that the racial makeup of a district's \"core\" is critical. Nor do we see why \"core\" makeup alone could help the court discern the relevant legislative motive. Nothing here suggests that only \"core\" makeup could answer the \"political/racial\" question that this Court previously found critical. Cromartie, 526 U.S., at 551-552.~    ~    ~      42~      The second matter-that Dr. Peterson's boundary segment analysis did not account for differences in population between precincts-relates to one aspect of Dr. Peterson's testimony. Appellants presented Dr. Peterson's testimony and data in support of four propositions: first, that registration figures do not accurately reflect actual voting behavior, see App. to Juris. Statement 173a-174a; second, that African-Americans are more reliable Democrats than whites, see id., at 159a-160a; third, that political affiliation explains splitting cities and counties as well as does race, see id., at 189a, 191a-192a, 182a-185a; and fourth, that differences in the racial and political makeup of the precincts just inside and outside the boundaries of District 12 show that politics is as good an explanation as is race for the district's boundaries, see id., at 161a-167a; 181a-182a. The District Court's criticism of Dr. Peterson's testimony at most affects the reliability of the fourth element of Dr. Peterson's testimony, his special boundary segment analysis. The District Court's criticism of Dr. Peterson's boundary segment analysis does not undermine the data related to the split communities. The criticism does not undercut Dr. Peterson's presentation of statistical evidence showing that registration was a poor indicator of party preference and that African-Americans are much more reliably Democratic voters, nor have we found in the record any significant evidence refuting that data.~    ~    ~      43~      At the same time, appellees themselves have used the information available in the record to create maps comparing the district's boundaries with Democrat/Republican voting behavior. See Appendixes A, B, and C, infra. Because no one challenges the accuracy of these maps, we assume that they are reliable; and we can assume that Dr. Peterson's testimony is reliable insofar as it confirms what the maps themselves contain and appellees themselves concede. Those maps, with certain exceptions discussed below, see infra, at 19-21, further indicate that the legislature drew boundaries that, in general, placed more-reliably Democratic voters inside the district, while placing less-reliably Democratic voters outside the district. And that fact, in turn, supports the State's answers to the questions we previously found critical.~    ~    D~    ~      44~      The District Court also relied on two pieces of \"direct\" evidence of discriminatory intent.~    ~    ~      45~      * The court found that a legislative redistricting leader, Senator Roy Cooper, when testifying before a legislative committee in 1997, had said that the 1997 plan satisfies a \"need for 'racial and partisan' balance.\" App. to Juris. Statement 27a. The court concluded that the words \"racial balance\" referred to a 10-to-2 Caucasian/African-American balance in the State's 12-member congressional delegation. Ibid. Hence, Senator Cooper had admitted that the legislature had drawn the plan with race in mind.~    ~    ~      46~      Senator Cooper's full statement reads as follows:~    ~    ~      47~      \"Those of you who dealt with Redistricting before realize that you cannot solve each problem that you encounter and everyone can find a problem with this Plan. However, I think that overall it provides for a fair, geographic, racial and partisan balance throughout the State of North Carolina. I think in order to come to an agreement all sides had to give a little bit, but I think we've reached an agreement that we can live with.\" App. 460.~    ~    ~      48~      We agree that one can read the statement about \"racial ... balance\" as the District Court read it-to refer to the current congressional delegation's racial balance. But even as so read, the phrase shows that the legislature considered race, along with other partisan and geographic considerations; and as so read it says little or nothing about whether race played a predominant role comparatively speaking. See Vera, 517 U.S., at 958 (O'Connor, J., principal opinion) (\"Strict scrutiny does not apply merely because redistricting is performed with consciousness of race\"); see also Miller, 515 U.S., at 916 (legislatures \"will ... almost always be aware of racial demographics\"); Shaw I, 509 U.S., at 646 (same).~    ~    2~    ~      49~      The second piece of \"direct\" evidence relied upon by the District Court is a February 10, 1997, e-mail sent from Gerry Cohen, a legislative staff member responsible for drafting districting plans, to Senator Cooper and Senator Leslie Winner. Cohen wrote: \"I have moved Greensboro Black community into the 12th, and now need to take [about] 60,000 out of the 12th. I await your direction on this.\" App. 369.~    ~    ~      50~      The reference to race-i.e., \"Black community\"-is obvious. But the e-mail does not discuss the point of the reference. It does not discuss why Greensboro's African-American voters were placed in the 12th District; it does not discuss the political consequences of failing to do so; it is addressed only to two members of the legislature; and it suggests that the legislature paid less attention to race in respect to the 12th District than in respect to the 1st District, where the e-mail provides a far more extensive, detailed discussion of racial percentages. It is less persuasive than the kinds of direct evidence we have found significant in other redistricting cases. See Vera, supra, at 959 (O'Connor, J., principal opinion) (State conceded that one of its goals was to create a majority-minority district); Miller, supra, at 907 (State set out to create majority-minority district); Shaw II, 517 U.S., at 906 (recounting testimony by Cohen that creating a majority-minority district was the \"principal reason\" for the 1992 version of District 12). Nonetheless, the e-mail offers some support for the District Court's conclusion.~    ~    E~    ~      51~      As we have said, we assume that the maps appended to appellees' brief reflect the record insofar as that record describes the relation between District 12's boundaries and reliably Democratic voting behavior. Consequently we shall consider appellees' related claims, made on appeal, that the maps provide significant support for the District Court, in that they show how the legislature might have \"swapped\" several more heavily African-American District 12 precincts for other less heavily African-American adjacent precincts-without harming its basic \"safely Democratic\" political objective. Cf. supra, at 10-11.~    ~    ~      52~      First, appellees suggest, without identifying any specific swap, that the legislature could have brought within District 12 several reliably Democratic, primarily white, precincts in Forsyth County. See Brief for Appellees 30. None of these precincts, however, is more reliably Democratic than the precincts immediately adjacent and within District 12. See Appendix A, infra (showing Demo-cratic strength reflected by Republican victories in each precinct); App. 484 (showing Democratic strength re-flected by Democratic registration). One of them, the Brown/Douglas Recreation Precinct, is heavily African-American. See ibid. And the remainder form a buffer between the home precinct of Fifth District Representative Richard Burr and the District 12 border, such that their removal from District 5 would deprive Representative Burr of a large portion of his own hometown, making him more vulnerable to a challenge from elsewhere within his district. App. to Juris. Statement 209a; App. 623. Consequently the Forsyth County precincts do not significantly help appellees' \"race not politics\" thesis.~    ~    ~      53~      Second, appellees say that the legislature might have swapped two District 12 Davidson County precincts (Thomasville 1 and Lexington 3) for a District 6 Guilford County precinct (Greensboro 17). See Brief for Appellees 30, n. 25. Whatever the virtues of such a swap, however, it would have diminished the size of District 12, geographically producing an unusually narrow isthmus linking District 12's north with its south and demographically producing the State's smallest district, deviating by about 1,300 below the legislatively endorsed ideal mean of 552,386 population. Traditional districting considerations consequently militated against any such swap. See Record, Deposition of Linwood Lee Jones 122 (stating that legislature's goal was to keep deviations from ideal population to less than 1,000); App. 199 (testimony of Sen. Cooper to same effect).~    ~    ~      54~      Third, appellees suggest that, in Mecklenburg County, two District 12 precincts (Charlotte 81 and LCI-South) be swapped with two District 9 precincts (Charlotte 10 and 21). See Brief for Appellees 30, n. 25. This suggestion is difficult to evaluate, as the parties provide no map that specifically identifies each precinct in Mecklenburg County by name. Nonetheless, from what we can tell, such a swap would make the district marginally more white (decreasing the African-American population by about 300 persons) while making the shape more questionable, leaving the precinct immediately to the south of Charlotte 81 jutting out into District 9. We are not convinced that this proposal materially advances appellees' claim.~    ~    ~      55~      Fourth, appellees argue that the legislature could have swapped two reliably Democratic Greensboro precincts outside District 12 (11 and 14) for four reliably Republican High Point precincts (1, 13, 15, and 19) placed within District 12. See ibid. The swap would not have improved racial balance significantly, however, for each of the six precincts have an African-American population of less than 35%. Additionally, it too would have altered the shape of District 12 for the worse. See Appendix D, infra; see also App. 622 (testimony of Gerry Cohen). And, in any event, the decision to exclude the two Greensboro precincts seems to reflect the legislature's decision to draw boundaries that follow main thoroughfares in Guilford County. App. to Juris. Statement 205a; App. 575.~    ~    ~      56~      Even if our judgments in respect to a few of these precincts are wrong, a showing that the legislature might have \"swapped\" a handful of precincts out of a total of 154 precincts, involving a population of a few hundred out of a total population of about half a million, cannot significantly strengthen appellees' case.~    ~    IV~    ~      57~      We concede the record contains a modicum of evidence offering support for the District Court's conclusion. That evidence includes the Cohen e-mail, Senator Cooper's reference to \"racial balance,\" and to a minor degree, some aspects of Dr. Weber's testimony. The evidence taken together, however, does not show that racial considerations predominated in the drawing of District 12's boundaries. That is because race in this case correlates closely with political behavior. The basic question is whether the legislature drew District 12's boundaries because of race rather than because of political behavior (coupled with traditional, nonracial districting considerations). It is not, as the dissent contends, see post, at 9, whether a legislature may defend its districting decisions based on a \"stereotype\" about African-American voting behavior. And given the fact that the party attacking the legislature's decision bears the burden of proving that racial considerations are \"dominant and controlling,\" Miller, 515 U.S., at 913, given the \"demanding\" nature of that burden of proof, id., at 929 (O'Connor, J., concurring), and given the sensitivity, the \"extraordinary caution,\" that district courts must show to avoid treading upon legislative prerogatives, id., at 916 (majority opinion), the attacking party has not successfully shown that race, rather than politics, predominantly accounts for the result. The record leaves us with the \"definite and firm conviction,\" United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S., at 395, that the District Court erred in finding to the contrary. And we do not believe that providing appellees a further opportunity to make their \"precinct swapping\" arguments in the District Court could change this result.~    ~    ~      58~      We can put the matter more generally as follows: In a case such as this one where majority-minority districts (or the approximate equivalent) are at issue and where racial identification correlates highly with political affiliation, the party attacking the legislatively drawn boundaries must show at the least that the legislature could have achieved its legitimate political objectives in alternative ways that are comparably consistent with traditional districting principles. That party must also show that those districting alternatives would have brought about significantly greater racial balance. Appellees failed to make any such showing here. We conclude that the District Court's contrary findings are clearly erroneous. Because of this disposition, we need not address appellants' alternative grounds for reversal.~    ~    ~      59~      The judgment of the District Court is Reversed.       Thomas, J., dissenting~    ~    ~      60~      Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy join, dissenting.~    ~    ~      61~      The issue for the District Court was whether racial considerations were predominant in the design of North Carolina's Congressional District 12. The issue for this Court is simply whether the District Court's factual finding-that racial considerations did predominate-was clearly erroneous. Because I do not believe the court below committed clear error, I respectfully dissent.~    ~    ~      62~      * The District Court's conclusion that race was the predominant factor motivating the North Carolina Legislature is a factual finding. See Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. 541, 549 (1999); Lawyer v. Department of Justice, 521 U.S. 567, 580 (1997); Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 905 (1996); Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 910 (1995). See also Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573 (1985) (\"[I]ntentional discrimination is a finding of fact ...\"). Accordingly, we should not overturn the District Court's determination unless it is clearly erroneous. See Lawyer, supra, at 580; Shaw, supra, at 910; Miller, supra, at 917. We are not permitted to reverse the court's finding \"simply because [we are] convinced that [we] would have decided the case differently.\" Anderson, supra, at 573. \"Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\" 470 U.S., at 574. We should upset the District Court's finding only if we are \" 'left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.' \" Id., at 573 (quoting United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395 (1948)).~    ~    ~      63~      The Court does cite cases that address the correct standard of review, see ante, at 7, and does couch its conclusion in \"clearly erroneous\" terms, see ante, at 22-23. But these incantations of the correct standard are empty gestures, contradicted by the Court's conclusion that it must engage in \"extensive review.\" See ante, at 7. In several ways, the Court ignores its role as a reviewing court and engages in its own factfinding enterprise.1 First, the Court suggests that there is some significance to the absence of an intermediate court in this action. See ibid. This cannot be a legitimate consideration. If it were legitimate, we would have mentioned it in prior redistricting cases. After all, in Miller and Shaw, we also did not have the benefit of intermediate appellate review. See also United States v. Oregon State Medical Soc., 343 U.S. 326, 330, 332 (1952) (engaging in clear error review of factual findings in a Sherman Act case where there was no intermediate appellate review). In these cases, we stated that the standard was simply \"clearly erroneous.\" Moreover, the implication of the Court's argument is that intermediate courts, because they are the first reviewers of the factfinder's conclusions, should engage in a level of review more rigorous than clear error review. This suggestion is not supported by law. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a) (\"Findings of fact, whether based on oral or documentary evidence, shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous ...\"). In fact, the very case the Court cited to articulate clear error review discussed the standard as it applied to an intermediate appellate court, which obviously did not have the benefit of another layer of review. See ante, at 7 (citing Anderson, supra, at 573).~    ~    ~      64~      Second, the Court appears to discount clear error review here because the trial was \"not lengthy.\" Ante, at 7. Even if considerations such as the length of the trial were relevant in deciding how to review factual findings, an assumption about which I have my doubts,2 these considerations would not counsel against deference in this action. The trial was not \"just a few hours\" long, Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 500 (1984); it lasted for three days in which the court heard the testimony of 12 witnesses. And quite apart from the total trial time, the District Court sifted through hundreds of pages of deposition testimony and expert analysis, including statistical analysis. It also should not be forgotten that one member of the panel has reviewed the iterations of District 12 since 1992. If one were to calibrate clear error review according to the trier of fact's familiarity with the case, there is simply no question that the court here gained a working knowledge of the facts of this litigation in myriad ways over a period far longer than three days.~    ~    ~      65~      Third, the Court downplays deference to the District Court's finding by highlighting that the key evidence was expert testimony requiring no traditional credibility determinations. See ante, at 7. As a factual matter, the Court overlooks the District Court's express assessment of the legislative redistricting leader's credibility. See App. to Juris. Statement in No. 99-1864, pp. 27a, 28a, n. 8. It is also likely that the court's interpretation of the e-mail written by Gerry Cohen, the primary drafter of District 12, was influenced by its evaluation of Cohen as a witness. See id., at 28a, n. 8. See also App. 261-268. And, as a legal matter, the Court's emphasis on the technical nature of the evidence misses the mark. Although we have recognized that particular weight should be given to a trial court's credibility determinations, we have never held that factual findings based on documentary evidence and expert testimony justify \"extensive review,\" ante, at 7. On the contrary, we explained in Anderson that \"[t]he rationale for deference ... is not limited to the superiority of the trial judge's position to make determinations of credibility.\" 470 U.S., at 574. See also Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a) (specifically referring to oral and documentary evidence). Instead, the rationale for deference extends to all determinations of fact because of the trial judge's \"expertise\" in making such determinations. 470 U.S., at 574. Accordingly, deference to the factfinder \"is the rule, not the exception,\" id., at 575, and I see no reason to depart from this rule in the case before us now.~    ~    ~      66~      Finally, perhaps the best evidence that the Court has emptied clear error review of meaningful content in the redistricting context (and the strongest testament to the fact that the District Court was dealing with a complex fact pattern) is the Court's foray into the minutiae of the record. I do not doubt this Court's ability to sift through volumes of facts or to argue its interpretation of those facts persuasively. But I do doubt the wisdom, efficiency, increased accuracy, and legitimacy of an extensive review that is any more searching than clear error review. See id., 574-575 (\"Duplication of the trial judge's efforts . . . would very likely contribute only negligibly to the accuracy of fact determination at a huge cost in diversion of judicial resources\"). Thus, I would follow our precedents and simply review the District Court's finding for clear error.~    ~    II~    ~      67~      Reviewing for clear error, I cannot say that the District Court's view of the evidence was impermissible.3 First, the court relied on objective measures of compactness, which show that District 12 is the most geographically scattered district in North Carolina, to support its conclusion that the district's design was not dictated by traditional districting concerns. App. to Juris. Statement in No. 99-1864, p. 26a. Although this evidence was available when we held that summary judgment was inappropriate, we certainly did not hold that it was irrelevant in determining whether racial gerrymandering occurred. On the contrary, we determined that there was a triable issue of fact. Moreover, although we acknowledged \"that a district's unusual shape can give rise to an inference of political motivation,\" we \"doubt[ed] that a bizarre shape equally supports a political inference and a racial one.\" Hunt, 526 U.S., at 547, n. 3. As we explained, \"[s]ome districts ... are 'so highly irregular that [they] rationally cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to segregat[e] ... voters' on the basis of race.\" Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).~    ~    ~      68~      Second, the court relied on the expert opinion of Dr. Weber, who interpreted statistical data to conclude that there were Democratic precincts with low black populations excluded from District 12, which would have created a more compact district had they been included.4 App. to Juris. Statement in No. 99-1864, p. 25a. And contrary to the Court's assertion, Dr. Weber did not merely examine the registration data in reaching his conclusions. Dr. Weber explained that he refocused his analysis on performance. He did so in response to our concerns, when we reversed the District Court's summary judgment finding, that voter registration might not be the best measure of the Democratic nature of a precinct. See id., at 26a (citing Trial Tr., which appears at App. 90-92, 105-107, 156-157). This fact was not lost on the District Court, which specifically referred to those pages of the record covering Dr. Weber's analysis of performance.~    ~    ~      69~      Third, the court credited Dr. Weber's testimony that the districting decisions could not be explained by political motives.5 App. to Juris. Statement in No. 99-1864, p. 26a. In the first instance, I, like the Court, ante, at 11, might well have concluded that District 12 was not significantly \"safer\" than several other districts in North Carolina merely because its Democratic reliability exceeded the optimum by only 3 percent. And I might have concluded that it would make political sense for incumbents to adopt a \"the more reliable the better\" policy in districting. However, I certainly cannot say that the court's inference from the facts was impermissible.6~    ~    ~      70~      Fourth, the court discredited the testimony of the State's witness, Dr. Peterson. App. to Juris. Statement in No. 99-1864, p. 27a (explaining that Dr. Weber testified that Dr. Peterson's analysis \"ignor[ed] the core,\" \"ha[d] not been appropriately done,\" and was \"unreliable\"). Again, like the Court, if I were a district court judge, I might have found that Dr. Weber's insistence that one could not ignore the core was unpersuasive.7 However, even if the core could be ignored, it seems to me that Dr. Weber's testimony-that Dr. Peterson had failed to analyze all of the segments and thus that his analysis was incomplete, App. 119-120-reasonably could have supported the court's conclusion.~    ~    ~      71~      Finally, the court found that other evidence demonstrated that race was foremost on the legislative agenda: an e-mail from the drafter of the 1992 and 1997 plans to senators in charge of legislative redistricting, the computer capability to draw the district by race, and statements made by Senator Cooper that the legislature was going to be able to avoid Shaw's majority-minority trigger by ending just short of the majority.8 App. to Juris. Statement in No. 99-1864, p. 28a. The e-mail, in combination with the indirect evidence, is evidence ample enough to support the District Court's finding for purposes of clear error review. The drafter of the redistricting plans reported in the bluntest of terms: \"I have moved Greensboro Black community into the 12th [District], and now need to take ... 60,000 out of the 12th [District].\" App. 369. Certainly the District Court was entitled to believe that the drafter was targeting voters and shifting district boundaries purely on the basis of race. The Court tries to belittle the import of this evidence by noting that the e-mail does not discuss why blacks were being targeted. See ante, at 18-19.~    ~    ~      72~      However, the District Court was assigned the task of determining whether, not why, race predominated. As I see it, this inquiry is sufficient to answer the constitutional question because racial gerrymandering offends the Constitution whether the motivation is malicious or benign. It is not a defense that the legislature merely may have drawn the district based on the stereotype that blacks are reliable Democratic voters. And regardless of whether the e-mail tended to show that the legislature was operating under an even stronger racial motivation when it was drawing District 1 than when it was drawing District 12, cf. ante, at 19, I am convinced that the District Court permissibly could have accorded great weight to this e-mail as direct evidence of a racial motive. Surely, a decision can be racially motivated even if another decision was also racially motivated.~    ~    ~      73~      If I were the District Court, I might have reached the same conclusion that the Court does, that \"[t]he evidence taken together . . . does not show that racial considerations predominated in the drawing of District 12's boundaries,\" ante, at 22. But I am not the trier of fact, and it is not my role to weigh evidence in the first instance. The only question that this Court should decide is whether the District Court's finding of racial predominance was clearly erroneous. In light of the direct evidence of racial motive and the inferences that may be drawn from the circumstantial evidence, I am satisfied that the District Court's finding was permissible, even if not compelled by the record.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         Despite its citation of Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U.S. 485 (1984), ante, at 7, I do not read the Court's opinion to suggest that the predominant factor inquiry, like the actual malice inquiry in Bose, should be reviewed de novo because it is a \"constitutional fac[t].\" 466 U.S., at 515 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). Nor could it, given our holdings in Lawyer v. Department of Justice, 521 U.S. 567 (1997), Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900 (1995), and Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899 (1996).~      ~      ~        2~         Bose, which the Court cites to support its discounting of clear error review, ante, at 7, does state that \"the likelihood that the appellate court will rely on the presumption [of correctness of factual findings] tends to increase when trial judges have lived with the controversy for weeks or months instead of just a few hours.\" 466 U.S., at 500. It is unclear, however, what bearing this statement of fact-that appellate courts will defer to factual findings more often when the trial was long-had on our understanding of the scope of clear error review. In Bose, we held that a lower court's \"actual malice\" finding must be reviewed de novo, see id., at 514, not that clear error review must be calibrated to the length of trial.~      ~      ~        3~         I assume, because the District Court did, that the goal of protecting incumbents is legitimate, even where, as here, individuals are incumbents by virtue of their election in an unconstitutional racially gerrymandered district. No doubt this assumption is a questionable proposition. Because the issue was not presented in this action, however, I do not read the Court's opinion as addressing it.~      ~      ~        4~         I do not think it necessary to impose a new burden on appellees to show that districting alternatives would have brought about \"significantly greater racial balance.\" Ante, at 22. I cannot say that it was impermissible for the court to conclude that race predominated in this action even if only a slightly better district could be drawn absent racial considerations. The District Court may reasonably have found that racial motivations predominated in selecting one alternative over another even if the net effect on racial balance was not \"significant.\"~      ~      ~        5~         Dr. Weber admitted that, when he first concluded that race was the motivating factor, he was under the mistaken impression that the legislature's computer program provided only racial, not political, data. The Court finds that this admission undercut the validity of Dr. Weber's conclusions. See ibid. Although the District Court could have found that this impression was a sufficiently significant assumption in Dr. Weber's analysis that the conclusions drawn from the analysis were suspect, it was not required to do so as a matter of logic. The court reasonably could have believed that the false impression had very little to do with the statistical analysis that was largely responsible for Dr. Weber's conclusions.~        In addition, the Court discounts Dr. Weber's testimony because he \"express[ed] disdain for a process that we have cautioned courts to respect,\" ibid. Dr. Weber did openly state that he believes that the best districts he had seen in the 1990's were those drawn by judges, not by legislatures. App. 150-151. However, whether Dr. Weber was simply stating the conclusions he has reached through his experience or was expressing a feeling of contempt toward the legislature is precisely the kind of tone, demeanor, and bias determination that even the Court acknowledges should be left to the factfinder, cf. ante, at 7.~      ~      ~        6~         The Court also criticizes Dr. Weber's testimony that Precinct 77's split was racially motivated and his proposed alternative that all of Precinct 77 could have been moved into District 9. Apparently the Court believes that it is obvious that the Republican incumbent in District 9 would not have wanted the whole of Precinct 77 in her district. See ante, at 12-13. But the Court addresses only part of Dr. Weber's alternative of how the districts could have been drawn in a race-neutral fashion. Dr. Weber explained that the alternative was not simply to move Precinct 77 into District 9. The alternative would also include moving other reliably Democratic precincts out of District 9 and into District 12, which presumably would have satisfied the incumbent. App. 157. This move would have had the result, not only of keeping Precinct 77 intact, but also of widening the corridor between the eastern and western portions of District 9 and thereby increasing the functional contiguity. The Court's other criticism, that moving all of Precinct 77 into District 12 would not work, is simply a red herring. Dr. Weber talked only of moving all of Precinct 77 into District 9, not of moving all of Precinct 77 into District 12.~      ~      ~        7~         Of course, considering that District 12 has never been constitutionally drawn, Dr. Weber's criticism-that the problem with the district lies not just at its edges, but at its core-is not without force.~      ~      ~        8~         The court also relied on the statement of legislative redistricting leader Senator Cooper to the North Carolina Legislature, see App. to Juris. Statement in No. 99-1864, p. 27a, in which the senator mentioned the goals of geographical, political, and racial balance, App. 460. In isolation, this statement does appear to support only the finding that race was a motive. Unlike this Court, however, the District Court had the advantage of listening to and watching Senator Cooper testify. I therefore am in no position to question the court's likely analysis that, although Senator Cooper mentioned all three motives, the predominance of race was apparent. This determination was made all the more reasonable by the fact that the District Court found the senator's claim regarding the \"happenstance\" final composition of the district to lack credibility in light of the e-mail.

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.C  L ENTERPRISES, INC., PETITIONERSv.CITIZEN BAND POTAWATOMI INDIAN TRIBE OF OKLAHOMA~    No. 00-292.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued March 19, 2001~    Decided April 30, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      Respondent, a federally recognized Indian Tribe, proposed and entered into a standard form construction contract with petitioner C  L Enterprises, Inc. (C  L), for the installation of a roof on a Tribe-owned commercial building in Oklahoma. The property in question lies outside the Tribe's reservation and is not held by the Federal Government in trust for the Tribe. The contract contains two key provisions. First, a clause provides that \"[a]ll ... disputes ... arising out of ... the Contract ... shall be decided by arbitration in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ... . The award rendered by the arbitrator ... shall be final, and judgment may be entered upon it in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\" The referenced American Arbitration Association Rules provide: \"Parties to these rules shall be deemed to have consented that judgment upon the arbitration award may be entered in any federal or state court having jurisdiction thereof.\" Second, the contract includes a choice-of-law clause that reads: \"The contract shall be governed by the law of the place where the Project is located.\" Oklahoma has adopted a Uniform Arbitration Act, which instructs that \"[t]he making of an agreement ... providing for arbitration in this state confers jurisdiction on the court to enforce the agreement under this act and to enter judgment on an award thereunder.\" The Act defines \"court\" as \"any court of competent jurisdiction of this state.\" After execution of the contract but before C  L commenced performance, the Tribe decided to change the roofing material specified in the contract. The Tribe solicited new bids and retained another company to install the roof. C  L, claiming that the Tribe had dishonored the contract, submitted an arbitration demand. The Tribe asserted sovereign immunity and declined to participate in the arbitration proceeding. It notified the arbitrator, however, that it had several substantive defenses to C  L's claim. The arbitrator received evidence and rendered an award in favor of C  L. The contractor filed suit to enforce the award in the District Court of Oklahoma County, a state court of general, first instance, jurisdiction. The Tribe appeared in court for the limited purpose of moving to dismiss the action on the ground that, as a sovereign, it was immune from suit. The District Court denied the motion and entered a judgment confirming the award. The Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals affirmed. While the Tribe's certiorari petition was pending here, this Court decided Kiowa Tribe of Okla. v. Manufacturing Technologies, Inc., 523 U.S. 751, holding that an Indian tribe is not subject to suit in a state court-even for breach of contract involving off-reservation commercial conduct-unless \"Congress has authorized the suit or the tribe has waived its immunity,\" id., at 754, 760. On remand for reconsideration in light of Kiowa, the Court of Civil Appeals held that the Tribe here was immune from suit on its contract with C  L. Although noting that the arbitration agreement and the contract language as to judicial enforcement seem to indicate the Tribe's willingness to expose itself to suit on the contract, the court concluded that the Tribe had not waived its suit immunity with the requisite clarity. The court therefore instructed the trial court to dismiss the case.~      Held: By the clear import of the arbitration clause, the Tribe is amenable to a state-court suit to enforce an arbitral award in favor of C  L. Like Kiowa, this case arises out of the breach of a commercial, off-reservation contract by a federally recognized Indian Tribe. C  L does not contend that Congress has abrogated tribal immunity in this setting. The question presented is whether the Tribe has waived its immunity. To relinquish its immunity, a tribe's waiver must be \"clear.\" Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Tribe of Okla., 498 U.S. 505, 509. The construction contract's arbitration provision and related prescriptions lead to the conclusion that the Tribe in this case has waived its immunity with the requisite clarity. The arbitration clause requires resolution of all contract-related disputes between the parties by binding arbitration; ensuing arbitral awards may be reduced to judgment \"in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\" For governance of arbitral proceedings, the clause specifies American Arbitration Association Rules, under which \"the arbitration award may be entered in any federal or state court having jurisdiction thereof.\" The contract's choice-of-law clause makes it plain enough that a \"court having jurisdiction\" to enforce the award in question is the Oklahoma state court in which C  L filed suit. By selecting Oklahoma law (\"the law of the place where the Project is located\") to govern the contract, the parties have effectively consented to confirmation of the award \"in accordance with\" the Oklahoma Uniform Arbitration Act, which prescribes that, when \"an agreement ... provid[es] for arbitration in\" Oklahoma, jurisdiction to enforce the agreement vests in \"any court of competent jurisdiction of this state.\" On any sensible reading of the Act, the District Court of Oklahoma County, a local court of general jurisdiction, fits that statutory description.~      This Court rejects the Tribe's contention that an arbitration clause is not a waiver of immunity from suit, but simply a waiver of the parties' rights to a court trial of contractual disputes. Under the clause, the Tribe recognizes, the parties must arbitrate. The clause no doubt memorializes the Tribe's commitment to adhere to the contract's dispute resolution regime. That regime has a real world objective; it is not designed for regulation of a game lacking practical consequences. And to the real world end, the contract specifically authorizes judicial enforcement of the resolution arrived at through arbitration. Also rejected is the Tribe's assertion that a form contract, designed principally for private parties who have no immunity to waive, cannot establish a clear waiver of tribal suit immunity. In appropriate cases, this Court applies the common-law rule of contract interpretation that a court should construe ambiguous language against the interest of the party that drafted it. That rule is inapposite here for two evident reasons. First, the contract is not ambiguous. Second, the Tribe did not find itself holding the short end of an adhesion contract stick: The Tribe proposed and prepared the contract; C  L foisted no form on the Tribe. Pp. 5-11.~      Reversed and remanded.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CIVIL APPEALS OF OKLAHOMA, SECOND DIVISION~      Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      In Kiowa Tribe of Okla. v. Manufacturing Technologies, Inc., 523 U.S. 751 (1998), this Court held that an Indian tribe is not subject to suit in a state court-even for breach of contract involving off-reservation commercial conduct-unless \"Congress has authorized the suit or the tribe has waived its immunity.\" Id., at 754. This case concerns the impact of an arbitration agreement on a tribe's plea of suit immunity. The document on which the case centers is a standard form construction contract signed by the parties to govern the installation of a foam roof on a building, the First Oklahoma Bank, in Shawnee, Oklahoma. The building and land are owned by an Indian Tribe, the Citizen Potawatomi Nation (Tribe). The building is commercial, and the land is off-reservation, nontrust property. The form contract, which was proposed by the Tribe and accepted by the contractor, C  L Enterprises, Inc. (C  L), contains an arbitration clause.~    ~    ~      2~      The question presented is whether the Tribe waived its immunity from suit in state court when it expressly agreed to arbitrate disputes with C  L relating to the contract, to the governance of Oklahoma law, and to the enforcement of arbitral awards \"in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\" We hold that, by the clear import of the arbitration clause, the Tribe is amenable to a state-court suit to enforce an arbitral award in favor of contractor C  L.~    ~    ~      3~      * Respondent Citizen Potawatomi Nation is a federally recognized Indian Tribe. In 1993, it entered into a contract with petitioner C  L for the installation of a roof on a Shawnee, Oklahoma, building owned by the Tribe. The building, which housed the First Oklahoma Bank, is not on the Tribe's reservation or on land held by the Federal Government in trust for the Tribe.~    ~    ~      4~      The contract at issue is a standard form agreement copyrighted by the American Institute of Architects. The Tribe proposed the contract; details not set out in the form were inserted by the Tribe and its architect. Two provisions of the contract are key to this case. First, the contract contains an arbitration clause:~    ~    ~      5~      \"All claims or disputes between the Contractor [C  L] and the Owner [the Tribe] arising out of or relating to the Contract, or the breach thereof, shall be decided by arbitration in accordance with the Construction [I]ndustry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association currently in effect unless the parties mutually agree otherwise ... . The award rendered by the arbitrator or arbitrators shall be final, and judgment may be entered upon it in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 46.~    ~    ~      6~      The American Arbitration Association Rules to which the clause refers provide: \"Parties to these rules shall be deemed to have consented that judgment upon the arbitration award may be entered in any federal or state court having jurisdiction thereof.\" American Arbitration Association, Construction Industry Dispute Resolution Procedures, R-48(c) (Sept. 1, 2000).~    ~    ~      7~      Second, the contract includes a choice-of-law clause that reads: \"The contract shall be governed by the law of the place where the Project is located.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 56. Oklahoma has adopted a Uniform Arbitration Act, which instructs that \"[t]he making of an agreement ... providing for arbitration in this state confers jurisdiction on the court to enforce the agreement under this act and to enter judgment on an award thereunder.\" Okla. Stat., Tit. 15, 802.B (1993). The Act defines \"court\" as \"any court of competent jurisdiction of this state.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      8~      After execution of the contract but before C  L commenced performance, the Tribe decided to change the roofing material from foam (the material specified in the contract) to rubber guard. The Tribe solicited new bids and retained another company to install the roof. C  L, claiming that the Tribe had dishonored the contract, submitted an arbitration demand. The Tribe asserted sovereign immunity and declined to participate in the arbitration proceeding. It notified the arbitrator, however, that it had several substantive defenses to C  L's claim. On consideration of C  L's evidence, the arbitrator rendered an award in favor of C  L for $25,400 in damages (close to 30% of the contract price), plus attorney's fees and costs.~    ~    ~      9~      Several weeks later, C  L filed suit to enforce the arbitration award in the District Court of Oklahoma County, a state court of general, first instance, jurisdiction. The Tribe appeared specially for the limited purpose of moving to dismiss the action on the ground that the Tribe was immune from suit. The District Court denied the motion and entered a judgment confirming the award.~    ~    ~      10~      The Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals affirmed, holding that the Tribe lacked immunity because the contract giving rise to the suit was \"between an Indian tribe and a non-Indian\" and was \"executed outside of Indian Country.\" Id., at 14 (citation omitted). The Oklahoma Supreme Court denied review, and the Tribe petitioned for certiorari in this Court.~    ~    ~      11~      While the Tribe's petition was pending here, the Court decided Kiowa, holding: \"Tribes enjoy immunity from suits on contracts, whether those contracts involve governmental or commercial activities and whether they were made on or off a reservation.\" 523 U.S., at 760. Kiowa reconfirmed: \"[A]n Indian tribe is subject to suit only where Congress has authorized the suit or the tribe has waived its immunity.\" Id., at 754. Thereafter, we granted the Tribe's petition in this case, vacated the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals, and remanded for reconsideration in light of Kiowa. 524 U.S. 901 (1998).~    ~    ~      12~      On remand, the Court of Civil Appeals changed course. It held that, under Kiowa, the Tribe here was immune from suit on its contract with C  L, despite the contract's off-reservation subject matter. App. to Pet. for Cert. 4-5. The court then addressed whether the Tribe had waived its immunity. \"The agreement of [the] Tribe to arbitration, and the contract language regarding enforcement in courts having jurisdiction,\" the court observed, \"seem to indicate a willingness on [the] Tribe's part to expose itself to suit on the contract.\" Id., at 7. But, the court quickly added, \"the leap from that willingness to a waiver of immunity is one based on implication, not an unequivocal expression.\" Ibid. Concluding that the Tribe had not waived its suit immunity with the requisite clarity, the appeals court instructed the trial court to dismiss the case. The Oklahoma Supreme Court denied C  L's petition for review.~    ~    ~      13~      Conflicting with the Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals' current decision, several state and federal courts have held that an arbitration clause, kin to the one now before us, expressly waives tribal immunity from a suit arising out of the contract. See Sokaogon Gaming Enterprise Corp. v. Tushie-Montgomery Associates, Inc., 86 F.3d 656, 661 (CA7 1996) (clause requiring arbitration of contractual disputes and authorizing entry of judgment upon arbitral award \"in any court having jurisdiction thereof\" expressly waived Tribe's immunity); Native Village of Eyak v. GC Contractors, 658 P.2d 756 (Alaska 1983) (same); Val/Del, Inc. v. Superior Court, 145 Ariz. 558, 703 P.2d 502 (Ct. App. 1985) (same). But cf. Pan American Co. v. Sycuan Band of Mission Indians, 884 F.2d 416 (CA9 1989) (clause requiring arbitration of contractual disputes did not expressly waive Tribe's immunity). We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict, 531 U.S. 956 (2000), and now reverse.~    ~    II~    ~      14~      Kiowa, in which we reaffirmed the doctrine of tribal immunity, involved an off-reservation, commercial agreement (a stock purchase) by a federally recognized Tribe. The Tribe signed a promissory note agreeing to pay the seller $285,000 plus interest. The note recited: \"Nothing in this Note subjects or limits the sovereign rights of the Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma.\" 523 U.S., at 753-754. The Tribe defaulted, the seller sued on the note in state court, and the Tribe asserted sovereign immunity. We upheld the plea. Tribal immunity, we ruled in Kiowa, extends to suits on off-reservation commercial contracts. Id., at 754-760. The Kiowa Tribe was immune from suit for defaulting on the promissory note, we held, because \"Congress ha[d] not abrogated [the Tribe's] immunity, nor ha[d] petitioner waived it.\" Id., at 760.~    ~    ~      15~      Like Kiowa, this case arises out of the breach of a commercial, off-reservation contract by a federally recognized Indian Tribe. The petitioning contractor, C  L, does not contend that Congress has abrogated tribal immunity in this setting. The question presented is whether the Tribe has waived its immunity.~    ~    ~      16~      To abrogate tribal immunity, Congress must \"unequivocally\" express that purpose. Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49, 58 (1978) (citing United States v. Testen, 424 U.S. 392, 399 (1976)). Similarly, to relinquish its immunity, a tribe's waiver must be \"clear.\" Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Tribe of Okla., 498 U.S. 505, 509 (1991). We are satisfied that the Tribe in this case has waived, with the requisite clarity, immunity from the suit C  L brought to enforce its arbitration award.~    ~    ~      17~      The construction contract's provision for arbitration and related prescriptions lead us to this conclusion. The arbitration clause requires resolution of all contract-related disputes between C  L and the Tribe by binding arbitration; ensuing arbitral awards may be reduced to judgment \"in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 46. For governance of arbitral proceedings, the arbitration clause specifies American Arbitration Association Rules for the construction industry, ibid., and under those Rules, \"the arbitration award may be entered in any federal or state court having jurisdiction thereof,\" American Arbitration Association, Construction Industry Dispute Resolution Procedures, R-48(c) (Sept. 1, 2000).~    ~    ~      18~      The contract's choice-of-law clause makes it plain enough that a \"court having jurisdiction\" to enforce the award in question is the Oklahoma state court in which C  L filed suit. By selecting Oklahoma law (\"the law of the place where the Project is located\") to govern the contract, App. to Pet. for Cert. 56, the parties have effectively consented to confirmation of the award \"in accordance with\" the Oklahoma Uniform Arbitration Act, id. at 46 (\"judgment may be entered upon [the arbitration award] in accordance with applicable law\"); Okla. Stat., Tit. 15, 802.A (1993) (\"This act shall apply to ... a provision in a written contract to submit to arbitration any controversy thereafter arising between the parties.\").1~    ~    ~      19~      The Uniform Act in force in Oklahoma prescribes that, when \"an agreement ... provid[es] for arbitration in this state,\" i.e., in Oklahoma, jurisdiction to enforce the agreement vests in \"any court of competent jurisdiction of this state.\" 802.B. On any sensible reading of the Act, the District Court of Oklahoma County, a local court of general jurisdiction, fits that statutory description.2~    ~    ~      20~      In sum, the Tribe agreed, by express contract, to adhere to certain dispute resolution procedures. In fact, the Tribe itself tendered the contract calling for those procedures. The regime to which the Tribe subscribed includes entry of judgment upon an arbitration award in accordance with the Oklahoma Uniform Arbitration Act. That Act concerns arbitration in Oklahoma and correspondingly designates as enforcement forums \"court[s] of competent jurisdiction of [Oklahoma].\" Ibid. C  L selected for its enforcement suit just such a forum. In a case involving an arbitration clause essentially indistinguishable from the one to which the Tribe and C  L agreed, the Seventh Circuit stated:~    ~    ~      21~      \"There is nothing ambiguous about th[e] language [of the arbitration clause]. The tribe agrees to submit disputes arising under the contract to arbitration, to be bound by the arbitration award, and to have its submission and the award enforced in a court of law.~    ~    ~      22~      . . . . .~    ~    ~      23~      \"The [tribal immunity] waiver ... is implicit rather than explicit only if a waiver of sovereign immunity, to be deemed explicit, must use the words 'sovereign immunity.' No case has ever held that.\" Sokaogon, 86 F.3d, at 659-660.~    ~    ~      24~      That cogent observation holds as well for the case we confront.3~    ~    ~      25~      The Tribe strenuously urges, however, that an arbitration clause simply \"is not a waiver of immunity from suit.\" Brief for Respondent 13. The phrase in the clause providing for enforcement of arbitration awards \"in any court having jurisdiction thereof,\" the Tribe maintains, \"begs the question of what court has jurisdiction.\" Id., at 22. As counsel for the Tribe clarified at oral argument, the Tribe's answer is \"no court,\" on earth or even on the moon. Tr. of Oral Arg. 32-33. No court-federal, state, or even tribal-has jurisdiction over C  L's suit, the Tribe insists, because it has not expressly waived its sovereign immunity in any judicial forum. Ibid.; cf. Sokaogon, 86 F.3d, at 660 (facing a similar argument, Seventh Circuit gleaned that counsel meant only a statement to this effect will do: \"The tribe will not assert the defense of sovereign immunity if sued for breach of contract.\").4~    ~    ~      26~      Instead of waiving suit immunity in any court, the Tribe argues, the arbitration clause waives simply and only the parties' rights to a court trial of contractual disputes; under the clause, the Tribe recognizes, the parties must instead arbitrate. Brief for Respondent 21 (\"An arbitration clause is what it is: a clause submitting contractual disputes to arbitration.\"). The clause no doubt memorializes the Tribe's commitment to adhere to the contract's dispute resolution regime. That regime has a real world objective; it is not designed for regulation of a game lacking practical consequences. And to the real world end, the contract specifically authorizes judicial enforcement of the resolution arrived at through arbitration. See Eyak, 658 P.2d, at 760 (\"[W]e believe it is clear that any dispute arising from a contract cannot be resolved by arbitration, as specified in the contract, if one of the parties intends to assert the defense of sovereign immunity... . The arbitration clause ... would be meaningless if it did not constitute a waiver of whatever immunity [the Tribe] possessed.\"); Val/Del, 145 Ariz., at 565, 703 P.2d, at 509 (because the Tribe has \"agree[d] that any dispute would be arbitrated and the result entered as a judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction, we find that there was an express waiver of the tribe's sovereign immunity\"); cf. Rosebud Sioux Tribe v. Val-U Constr. Co., 50 F.3d 560, 562 (CA8 1995) (agreement to arbitrate contractual disputes did not contain provision for court enforcement; court nonetheless observed that \"disputes could not be resolved by arbitration if one party intended to assert sovereign immunity as a defense\").5~    ~    ~      27~      The Tribe also asserts that a form contract, designed principally for private parties who have no immunity to waive, cannot establish a clear waiver of tribal suit immunity. Brief for Respondent 20; Tr. of Oral Arg. 27-28. In appropriate cases, we apply \"the common-law rule of contract interpretation that a court should construe ambiguous language against the interest of the party that drafted it.\" Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U.S. 52, 62 (1995) (construing form contract containing arbitration clause). That rule, however, is inapposite here. The contract, as we have explained, is not ambiguous. Nor did the Tribe find itself holding the short end of an adhesion contract stick: The Tribe proposed and prepared the contract; C  L foisted no form on a quiescent Tribe. Cf. United States v. Bankers Ins. Co., __ F.3d __, __, No. 00-1342, 2001 WL 293669, *3 (CA4, Mar. 27, 2001) (where federal agency prepared agreement, including its arbitration provision, sovereign immunity does not shield the agency from engaging in the arbitration process).6~    ~    ~      28~      * * *~    ~    ~      29~      For the reasons stated, we conclude that under the agreement the Tribe proposed and signed, the Tribe clearly consented to arbitration and to the enforcement of arbitral awards in Oklahoma state court; the Tribe thereby waived its sovereign immunity from C  L's suit. The judgment of the Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      30~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      ~        Notes~      ~      ~        1~         The United States, as amicus supporting the Tribe, urges us to remain within the \"four corners of the contract\" and refrain from reliance on \"secondary sources.\" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19, and n. 7. The American Arbitration Association Rules and the Uniform Arbitration Act, however, are not secondary interpretive aides that supplement our reading of the contract; they are prescriptions incorporated by the express terms of the agreement itself.~      ~      ~        2~         The United States argues that the Oklahoma Uniform Arbitration Act is inapplicable in this case because it does not reach all arbitrations properly held in Oklahoma, but only those in which the agreement explicitly \"provide[s] for arbitration in [Oklahoma].\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 47-48 (referring to 802.B). No Oklahoma authority is cited for this constricted reading of an Act that expressly \"appl[ies] to ... a provision in a written contract to submit to arbitration any controversy thereafter arising between the parties.\" 802.A. We decline to attribute to the Oklahoma lawmakers and interpreters a construction that so severely shrinks the Act's domain.~      ~      ~        3~         Instructive here is the law governing waivers of immunity by foreign sovereigns. Cf. Kiowa Tribe of Okla. v. Manufacturing Technologies, Inc., 523 U.S. 751, 759 (1998) (\"In considering Congress' role in reforming tribal immunity, we find instructive the problems of sovereign immunity for foreign countries.\"). \"Under the law of the United States ... an agreement to arbitrate is a waiver of immunity from jurisdiction in ... an action to enforce an arbitral award rendered pursuant to the agreement ... .\" Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States 456(2)(b)(ii) (1987).~      ~      ~        4~         Relying on our state sovereign immunity jurisprudence, the United States maintains that \"courts must be especially reluctant to construe ambiguous expressions as consent by a Tribe to be sued in state court.\" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23; see also id., at 25 (arguing that a State's generalized consent to suit, without an express selection of the forum in which suit may proceed, \"should be construed narrowly as the State's consent to be sued in its own courts of competent jurisdiction, and not its consent to be subjected to suits in another sovereign's courts\") (citing, e.g., Kennecott Copper Corp. v. State Tax Comm'n, 327 U.S. 573 (1946) (State statute authorizing suits against State in \"any court of competent jurisdiction\" did not waive State's immunity from suit in federal court)). But in this case, as we explained supra, at 6-7, the Tribe has plainly consented to suit in Oklahoma state court. We therefore have no occasion to decide whether parallel principles govern state and tribal waivers of immunity.~      ~      ~        5~         The Tribe's apparent concession-that the arbitration clause embodies the parties' agreement to resolve disputes through arbitration-is not altogether consistent with the Tribe's refusal to participate in the arbitration proceedings.~      ~      ~        6~         The Tribe alternatively urges affirmance on the grounds that the contract is void under 25 U.S.C.  81 and that the members of the Tribe who executed the contract lacked the authority to do so on the Tribe's behalf. These issues were not aired in the Oklahoma courts and are not within the scope of the questions on which we granted review. We therefore decline to address them.~      ~    ~    ",

Readers are requested to notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D. C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.COOPER INDUSTRIES, INC., PETITIONERv.LEATHERMAN TOOL GROUP, INC.~    No. 99-2035.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued February 26, 2001~    Decided May 14, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      Respondent Leatherman Tool Group, Inc., manufactures a multifunction tool which improves on the classic Swiss army knife. When petitioner Cooper Industries, Inc., used photographs of a modified version of Leatherman's tool in posters, packaging, and advertising materials introducing a competing tool, Leatherman filed this action asserting, inter alia, violations of the Trademark Act of 1946 (Lanham Act). Ultimately, a trial jury awarded Leatherman $50,000 in compensatory damages and $4.5 million in punitive damages. Rejecting Cooper's arguments that the punitive damages were grossly excessive under BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, the District Court entered judgment. As relevant here, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the punitive damages award, concluding that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in declining to reduce that award.~      Held: Courts of Appeals should apply a de novo standard when reviewing district court determinations of the constitutionality of punitive damages awards. The Ninth Circuit erred in applying the less demanding abuse-of-discretion standard in this case. Pp. 6-18.~      (a) Compensatory damages redress the concrete loss that a plaintiff has suffered by reason of the defendant's wrongful conduct, but punitive damages are private fines intended to punish the defendant and deter future wrongdoing. A jury's assessment of the former is essentially a factual determination, but its imposition of the latter is an expression of its moral condemnation. States have broad discretion in imposing criminal penalties and punitive damages. Thus, when no constitutional issue is raised, a federal appellate court reviews the trial court's determination under an abuse-of-discretion standard. Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U.S. 257, 279. However, the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause imposes substantive limits on the States' discretion, making the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against excessive fines and cruel and unusual punishments applicable to the States, Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, and prohibiting States from imposing \"grossly excessive\" punishments on tortfeasors, e.g., Gore, 517 U.S., at 562. The cases in which such limits were enforced involved constitutional violations predicated on judicial determinations that the punishments were grossly disproportional to the gravity of the offense. E.g., United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U.S. 321, 334. The relevant constitutional line is inherently imprecise, id., at 336, but, in deciding whether that line has been crossed, this Court has focused on the same three criteria: (1) the degree of the defendant's reprehensibility or culpability; (2) the relationship between the penalty and the harm to the victim caused by the defendant's actions; and (3) the sanctions imposed in other cases for comparable misconduct. See, e.g., Gore, 517 U.S., at 575-585; Bajakajian, 524 U.S., at 337, 339, and 340-343. Moreover, and of greatest relevance for the instant issue, in each case the Court has engaged in an independent examination of the relevant criteria. See, e.g., id., at 337-344; Gore, 517 U.S., at 575-586. The reasons supporting the Court's holding in Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, that trial judges' reasonable suspicion and probable cause determinations should be reviewed de novo-that \"reasonable suspicion\" and \"probable cause\" are fluid concepts that take their substantive content from the particular contexts in which the standards are being expressed; that, because such concepts acquire content only through case-by-case application, independent review is necessary if appellate courts are to maintain control of, and clarify, legal principles; and that de novo review tends to unify precedent and stabilize the law-are equally applicable when passing on district court determinations of the constitutionality of punitive damages awards. Pp. 6-12.~      (b) Because a jury's award of punitive damages is not a finding of \"fact,\" appellate review of the District Court's determination that an award is consistent with due process does not implicate the Seventh Amendment concerns raised by Leatherman and its amici. Pp. 12-16.~      (c) It seems likely in this case that a thorough, independent review of the District Court's rejection of Cooper's due process objections to the punitive damages award might have led the Ninth Circuit to reach a different result. In fact, this Court's own consideration of the three Gore factors reveals questionable conclusions by the District Court that may not survive de novo review and illustrates why the Ninth Circuit's answer to the constitutional question may depend on the standard of review.

Ginsburg, J., filed a dissenting opinion.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      A jury found petitioner guilty of unfair competition and awarded respondent $50,000 in compensatory damages and $4.5 million in punitive damages. The District Court held that the punitive damages award did not violate the Federal Constitution. The Court of Appeals concluded that \"the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to reduce the amount of punitive damages.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a. The issue in this case is whether the Court of Appeals applied the wrong standard of review in considering the constitutionality of the punitive damages award.~    ~    ~      2~      * The parties are competing tool manufacturers. In the 1980's, Leatherman Tool Group, Inc. (Leatherman or respondent), introduced its Pocket Survival Tool (PST). The Court of Appeals described the PST as an \"ingenious multi-function pocket tool which improves on the classic 'Swiss army knife' in a number of respects. Not the least of the improvements was the inclusion of pliers, which, when unfolded, are nearly equivalent to regular full-sized pliers... . Leatherman apparently created largely and undisputedly now dominates the market for multifunction pocket tools which generally resemble the PST.\" Leatherman Tool Group v. Cooper Industries, 199 F.3d 1009, 1010 (CA9 1999).~    ~    ~      3~      In 1995, Cooper Industries, Inc. (Cooper or petitioner), decided to design and market a competing multifunction tool. Cooper planned to copy the basic features of the PST, add a few features of its own, and sell the new tool under the name \"ToolZall.\" Cooper hoped to capture about 5% of the multifunction tool market. The first ToolZall was designed to be virtually identical to the PST,1 but the design was ultimately modified in response to this litigation. The controversy to be resolved in this case involves Cooper's improper advertising of its original ToolZall design.~    ~    ~      4~      Cooper introduced the original ToolZall in August 1996 at the National Hardware Show in Chicago. At that show, it used photographs in its posters, packaging, and advertising materials that purported to be of a ToolZall but were actually of a modified PST. When those materials were prepared, the first of the ToolZalls had not yet been manufactured. A Cooper employee created a ToolZall \"mock-up\" by grinding the Leatherman trademark from handles and pliers of a PST and substituting the unique fastenings that were to be used on the ToolZall. At least one of photographs was retouched to remove a curved indentation where the Leatherman trademark had been. The photographs were used, not only at the trade show, which normally draws an audience of over 70,000 people, but also in the marketing materials and catalogs used by Cooper's sales force throughout the United States. Cooper also distributed a touched-up line drawing of a PST to its international sales representatives.2~    ~    ~      5~      Shortly after the trade show, Leatherman filed this action asserting claims of trade-dress infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising under 43(a) of the Trademark Act of 1946 (Lanham Act), 60 Stat. 441, as amended, 15 U.S.C.  1125(a) (1994 ed. and Supp. V), and a common-law claim of unfair competition for advertising and selling an \"imitation\" of the PST. In December 1996, the District Court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting Cooper from marketing the ToolZall and from using pictures of the modified PST in its advertising. Cooper withdrew the original ToolZall from the market and developed a new model with plastic coated handles that differed from the PST. In November 1996, it had anticipatorily sent a notice to its sales personnel ordering a recall of all promotional materials containing pictures of the PST, but it did not attempt to retrieve the materials it had sent to its customers until the following April. As a result, the offending promotional materials continued to appear in catalogs and advertisements well into 1997.~    ~    ~      6~      After a trial conducted in October 1997, the jury returned a verdict that answered several special interrogatories. With respect to the Lanham Act infringement claims, the jury found that Leatherman had trademark rights in the overall appearance of the PST and that the original ToolZall infringed those rights but that the infringement had not damaged Leatherman. It then found that the modified ToolZall did not infringe Leatherman's trademark rights in the PST. With respect to the advertising claims, it found Cooper guilty of passing off, false advertising, and unfair competition and assessed aggregate damages of $50,000 on those claims. It then answered \"Yes\" to the following interrogatory: \"Has Leatherman shown by clear and convincing evidence that by engaging in false advertising or passing off, Cooper acted with malice, or showed a reckless and outrageous indifference to a highly unreasonable risk of harm and has acted with a conscious indifference to Leatherman's rights?\" App. 18. Because it answered this question in the affirmative, the jury was instructed to determine the \"amount of punitive damages [that] should be awarded to Leatherman.\" Ibid. The jury awarded $4.5 million. Ibid.~    ~    ~      7~      After the jury returned its verdict, the District Court considered, and rejected, arguments that the punitive damages were \"grossly excessive\" under our decision in BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559 (1996). See App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a. It then entered its judgment, which provided that 60% of the punitive damages would be paid to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Account of the State of Oregon. The judgment also permanently enjoined Cooper from marketing its original ToolZall in the United States or in 22 designated foreign countries.~    ~    ~      8~      On appeal, Cooper challenged both the District Court's injunction against copying the PST and the punitive damages award. The Court of Appeals issued two opinions. In its published opinion it set aside the injunction. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc. v. Cooper Industries, Inc., supra. It held that the overall appearance of the PST was not protected under the trademark laws because its distinguishing features, and the combination of those features, were functional. Accordingly, even though Cooper had deliberately copied the PST, it acted lawfully in doing so.3~    ~    ~      9~      In its unpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed the punitive damages award. It first rejected Cooper's argument that the Oregon Constitution, which has been interpreted to prohibit awards of punitive damages for torts that impose liability for speech, precluded the jury's award of such damages in this case. It then reviewed the District Court's finding that the award \"was proportional and fair, given the nature of the conduct, the evidence of intentional passing off, and the size of an award necessary to create deterrence to an entity of Cooper's size\" and concluded \"that the award did not violate Cooper's due process rights\" under the Federal Constitution. App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a, judgt. order reported at 205 F.3d 1351 (CA9 1999). It noted that the \"passing off\" in this case was \"very unusual\" because \"even assuming PST is a superior product,\" no superior features of the PST were perceivable in the photographs. App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a. \"Any customer who bought based on what the photographs showed would have received essentially that for which he or she paid.\" Ibid. Thus, Cooper's use of the photographs of the PST did not involve \"the same sort of potential harm to Leatherman or to customers as that which may arise from traditional passing off.\" Id., at 4a. The Court of Appeals made clear, however, that it did not condone the passing off. \"[A]t a minimum,\" it observed, \"[the passing off] gave Cooper an unfair advantage\" by allowing it to use Leatherman's work product \"to obtain a 'mock-up' more cheaply, easily, and quickly\" than if it had waited until its own product was ready. Ibid. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals concluded, \"the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to reduce the amount of punitive damages.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      10~      Cooper's petition for a writ of certiorari asked us to decide whether the Court of Appeals reviewed the constitutionality of the punitive damages award under the correct standard and also whether the award violated the criteria we articulated in Gore. We granted the petition to resolve confusion among the Courts of Appeals on the first question.4 531 U.S. 923 (2000). We now conclude that the constitutional issue merits de novo review. Because the Court of Appeals applied an \"abuse of discretion\" standard, we remand the case for determination of the second question under the proper standard.~    ~    II~    ~      11~      Although compensatory damages and punitive damages are typically awarded at the same time by the same decisionmaker, they serve distinct purposes. The former are intended to redress the concrete loss that the plaintiff has suffered by reason of the defendant's wrongful conduct. See Restatement (Second) of Torts 903, pp. 453-454 (1979); Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U.S. 1, 54 (1991) (O'Connor, J., dissenting). The latter, which have been described as \"quasi-criminal,\" id., at 19, operate as \"private fines\" intended to punish the defendant and to deter future wrongdoing. A jury's assessment of the extent of a plaintiff's injury is essentially a factual determination, whereas its imposition of punitive damages is an expression of its moral condemnation. See Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 350 (1974) (\"[Punitive damages] are not compensation for injury. Instead, they are private fines levied by civil juries to punish reprehensible conduct and to deter its future occurrence\"); Haslip, 499 U.S., at 54 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (\"[P]unitive damages are specifically designed to exact punishment in excess of actual harm to make clear that the defendant's misconduct was especially reprehensible\").5~    ~    ~      12~      Legislatures have extremely broad discretion in defining criminal offenses, Schall v. Martin, 467 U.S. 253, 268-269, n. 18 (1984), and in setting the range of permissible punishments for each offense, ibid.; Solem v. Helm, 463 U.S. 277, 290 (1983). Judicial decisions that operate within these legislatively-enacted guidelines are typically reviewed for abuse of discretion. See, e.g., Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 96, 99-100 (1996); cf. Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 481 (2000) (it is permissible \"for judges to exercise discretion ... in imposing a judgment within the range prescribed by statute\").~    ~    ~      13~      As in the criminal sentencing context, legislatures enjoy broad discretion in authorizing and limiting permissible punitive damages awards. Cf. Gore, 517 U.S., at 568 (\"States necessarily have considerable flexibility in determining the level of punitive damages that they will allow in different classes of cases and in any particular case\"). A good many States have enacted statutes that place limits on the permissible size of punitive damages awards.6 When juries make particular awards within those limits, the role of the trial judge is \"to determine whether the jury's verdict is within the confines set by state law, and to determine, by reference to federal standards developed under Rule 59, whether a new trial or remittitur should be ordered.\" Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U.S. 257, 279 (1989). If no constitutional issue is raised, the role of the appellate court, at least in the federal system, is merely to review the trial court's \"determination under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\" Ibid.7~    ~    ~      14~      Despite the broad discretion that States possess with respect to the imposition of criminal penalties and punitive damages, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution imposes substantive limits on that discretion. That Clause makes the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against excessive fines and cruel and unusual punishments applicable to the States. Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972) (per curiam). The Due Process Clause of its own force also prohibits the States from imposing \"grossly excessive\" punishments on tortfeasors, Gore, 517 U.S., at 562; TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U.S. 443, 453-455 (1993) (plurality opinion).~    ~    ~      15~      The Court has enforced those limits in cases involving deprivations of life, Enmund v. Florida, 458 U.S. 782, 787, 801 (1982) (death is not \"a valid penalty under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments for one who neither took life, attempted to take life, nor intended to take life\"); Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 584, 592 (1977) (opinion of White, J.) (sentence of death is \"grossly disproportionate\" and excessive punishment for the crime of rape);8 deprivations of liberty, Solem v. Helm, 463 U.S., at 279, 303 (life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for nonviolent felonies is \"significantly disproportionate\"); and deprivations of property, United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U.S. 321, 324 (1998) (punitive forfeiture of $357,144 for violating reporting requirement was \"grossly disporportional\" to the gravity of the offense); Gore, 517 U.S., at 585-586 ($2 million punitive damages award for fail- ing to advise customers of minor predelivery repairs to new automobiles was \"grossly excessive\" and therefore unconstitutional).~    ~    ~      16~      In these cases, the constitutional violations were predicated on judicial determinations that the punishments were \"grossly disproportional to the gravity of ... defendant[s'] offense[s].\" Bajakajian, 524 U.S., at 334; see also Gore, 517 U.S., at 585-586; Solem, 463 U.S., at 303; Coker, 433 U.S., at 592 (opinion of White, J.). We have recognized that the relevant constitutional line is \"inherently imprecise,\" Bajakajian, 524 U.S., at 336, rather than one \"marked by a simple mathematical formula,\" Gore, 517 U.S., at 582. But in deciding whether that line has been crossed, we have focused on the same general criteria: the degree of the defendant's reprehensibility or culpability, see, e.g., Bajakajian, 524 U.S., at 337; Gore, 517 U.S., at 575-580; Solem, 463 U.S., at 290-291; Enmund, 458 U.S., at 798; Coker, 433 U.S., at 598 (opinion of White, J.); the relationship between the penalty and the harm to the victim caused by the defendant's actions, see, e.g., Bajakajian, 524 U.S., at 339; Gore, 517 U.S., at 580-583; Solem, 463 U.S., at 293; Enmund, 458 U.S., at 798; Coker, 433 U.S., at 598 (opinion of White, J.); and the sanctions imposed in other cases for comparable misconduct, see, e.g., Bajakajian, 524 U.S., at 340-343; Gore, 517 U.S., at 583-585; Solem, 463 U.S., at 291; Enmund, 458 U.S., at 789-796; Coker, 433 U.S., at 593-597 (opinion of White, J.). Moreover, and of greatest relevance for the issue we address today, in each of these cases we have engaged in an independent examination of the relevant criteria. See, e.g., Bajakajian, 524 U.S., at 337-344; Gore, 517 U.S., at 575-586; Solem, 463 U.S., at 295-300; Enmund, 458 U.S., at 788-801; Coker, 433 U.S., at 592-600 (opinion of White, J.).~    ~    ~      17~      In Bajakajian, we expressly noted that the courts of appeals must review the proportionality determination \"de novo\" and specifically rejected the suggestion of the respondent, who had prevailed in the District Court, that the trial judge's determination of excessiveness should be reviewed only for an abuse of discretion. \"The factual findings made by the district courts in conducting the excessiveness inquiry, of course, must be accepted unless clearly erroneous... . But the question whether a fine is constitutionally excessive calls for the application of a constitutional standard to the facts of a particular case, and in this context de novo review of that question is appropriate.\" 524 U.S., at 336-337, n. 10 (citing Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 697 (1996)).~    ~    ~      18~      Likewise, in Ornelas, we held that trial judges' determinations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause should be reviewed de novo on appeal. The reasons we gave in support of that holding are equally applicable in this case. First, as we observed in Ornelas, the precise meaning of concepts like \"reasonable suspicion\" and \"probable cause\" cannot be articulated with precision; they are \"fluid concepts that take their substantive content from the particular contexts in which the standards are being assessed.\" Id., at 696. That is, of course, also a characteristic of the concept of \"gross excessiveness.\" Second, \"the legal rules for probable cause and reasonable suspicion acquire content only through application. Independent review is therefore necessary if appellate courts are to maintain control of, and to clarify, the legal principles.\" Id., at 697. Again, this is also true of the general criteria set forth in Gore; they will acquire more meaningful content through case-by-case application at the appellate level. \"Finally, de novo review tends to unify precedent\" and \" 'stabilize the law.' \" Id., at 697-698. Justice Breyer made a similar point in his concurring opinion in Gore:~    ~    ~      19~      \"Requiring the application of law, rather than a decisionmaker's caprice, does more than simply provide citizens notice of what actions may subject them to punishment; it also helps to assure the uniform treatment of similarly situated persons that is the essence of law itself.\" 517 U.S., at 587. Our decisions in analogous cases, together with the reasoning that produced those decisions, thus convince us that courts of appeals should apply a de novo standard of review when passing on district courts' determinations of the constitutionality of punitive damages awards.9~    ~    III~    ~      20~      \"Unlike the measure of actual damages suffered, which presents a question of historical or predictive fact, see, e.g., [St. Louis, I. M.  S. R. Co. v. Craft, 237 U.S. 648 (1915)], the level of punitive damages is not really a 'fact' 'tried' by the jury.\" Gasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc., 518 U.S. 415, 459 (1996) (Scalia, J., dissenting). Because the jury's award of punitive damages does not constitute a finding of \"fact,\" appellate review of the District Court's determination that an award is consistent with due process does not implicate the Seventh Amendment concerns raised by respondent and its amicus.10 See Brief for Respondent 18-24; Brief for Association of Trial Lawyers of America as Amicus Curiae 17-20. Our decisions in Gasperini and Hetzel v. Prince William County, 523 U.S. 208 (1998) (per curiam), both of which concerned compensatory damages, are not to the contrary.11~    ~    ~      21~      It might be argued that the deterrent function of punitive damages suggests that the amount of such damages awarded is indeed a \"fact\" found by the jury and that, as a result, the Seventh Amendment is implicated in appellate review of that award. Some scholars, for example, assert that punitive damages should be used to compensate for the underdeterrence of unlawful behavior that will result from a defendant's evasion of liability. See Polinsky  Shavell, Punitive Damages: An Economic Analysis, 111 Harv. L. Rev. 869, 890-891 (1998) (in order to obtain optimal deterrence, \"punitive damages should equal the harm multiplied by ... the ratio of the injurer's chance of escaping liability to his chance of being found liable\"); see also Ciraolo v. New York, 216 F.3d 236, 244-245 (CA2 2000) (Calabresi, J., concurring). \"The efficient deterrence theory thus regards punitive damages as merely an augmentation of compensatory damages designed to achieve economic efficiency.\" Galanter  Luban, Poetic Justice: Punitive Damages and Legal Pluralism, 42 Am. U. L. Rev. 1393, 1449 (1993).~    ~    ~      22~      However attractive such an approach to punitive damages might be as an abstract policy matter, it is clear that juries do not normally engage in such a finely tuned exercise of deterrence calibration when awarding punitive damages. See Sunstein, Schkade,  Kahneman, Do People Want Optimal Deterrence?, 29 J. Legal Studies 237, 240 (2000). After all, deterrence is not the only purpose served by punitive damages. See supra, at 6-7. And there is no dispute that, in this case, deterrence was but one of four concerns the jury was instructed to consider when setting the amount of punitive damages.12 Moreover, it is not at all obvious that even the deterrent function of punitive damages can be served only by economically \"optimal deterrence.\" \"[C]itizens and legislators may rightly insist that they are willing to tolerate some loss in economic efficiency in order to deter what they consider morally offensive conduct, albeit cost-beneficial morally offensive conduct; efficiency is just one consideration among many.\" Galanter  Luban, 42 Am. U. L. Rev., at 1450.13    Differences in the institutional competence of trial judges and appellate judges are consistent with our conclusion. In Gore, we instructed courts evaluating a punitive damages award's consistency with due process to consider three criteria: (1) the degree or reprehensibility of the defendant's misconduct, (2) the disparity between the harm (or potential harm) suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award, and (3) the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases. 517 U.S., at 574-575. Only with respect to the first Gore inquiry do the district courts have a somewhat superior vantage over courts of appeals, and even then the advantage exists primarily with respect to issues turning on witness credibility and demeanor.14 Trial courts and appellate courts seem equally capable of analyzing the second factor. And the third Gore criterion, which calls for a broad legal comparison, seems more suited to the expertise of appellate courts. Considerations of institutional competence therefore fail to tip the balance in favor of deferential appellate review.~    ~    IV~    ~      23~      It is possible that the standard of review applied by the Court of Appeals will affect the result of the Gore analysis in only a relatively small number of cases. See Brief for Respondent 46-48; Brief for Association of American Railroads as Amicus Curiae 18; see also Gasperini, 518 U.S., at 448 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Nonetheless, it does seem likely that in this case a thorough, independent review of the District Court's rejection of petitioner's due process objections to the punitive damages award might well have led the Court of Appeals to reach a different result. Indeed, our own consideration of each of the three Gore factors reveals a series of questionable conclusions by the District Court that may not survive de novo review.~    ~    ~      24~      When the jury assessed the reprehensibility of Cooper's misconduct, it was guided by instructions that characterized the deliberate copying of the PST as wrongful. The jury's selection of a penalty to deter wrongful conduct may, therefore, have been influenced by an intent to deter Cooper from engaging in such copying in the future. Similarly, the District Court's belief that Cooper acted unlawfully in deliberately copying the PST design might have influenced its consideration of the first Gore factor. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a. But, as the Court of Appeals correctly held, such copying of the functional features of an unpatented product is lawful. See TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays, Inc., 532 U.S. ___ (2001). The Court of Appeals recognized that the District Court's award of attorney's fees could not be supported if based on the premise that the copying was unlawful, but it did not consider whether that improper predicate might also have undermined the basis for the jury's large punitive damages award.~    ~    ~      25~      In evaluating the second Gore factor, the ratio between the size of the award of punitive damages and the harm caused by Cooper's tortious conduct, the District Court might have been influenced by respondent's submission that it was not the actual injury-which the jury assessed at $50,000-that was relevant, but rather \"the potential harm Leatherman would have suffered had Cooper succeeded in its wrongful conduct.\" See Brief for Respondent 7, see also Record Doc. No. 323, p. 23. Respondent calculated that \"potential harm\" by referring to the fact that Cooper had anticipated \"gross profits of approximately $3 million during the first five years of sales.\" Brief for Respondent 7; see also Record Doc. No. 323, at 23. Even if that estimate were correct, however, it would be unrealistic to assume that all of Cooper's sales of the ToolZall would have been attributable to its misconduct in using a photograph of a modified PST in its initial advertising materials. As the Court of Appeals pointed out, the picture of the PST did not misrepresent the features of the original ToolZall and could not have deceived potential customers in any significant way. Its use was wrongful because it enabled Cooper to expedite the promotion of its tool, but that wrongdoing surely could not be treated as the principal cause of Cooper's entire sales volume for a 5-year period.~    ~    ~      26~      With respect to the third Gore factor, respondent argues that Cooper would have been subject to a comparable sanction under Oregon's Unlawful Trade Practices Act. Brief for Respondent 49. In a suit brought by a State under that Act, a civil penalty of up to $25,000 per violation may be assessed. Ore. Rev. Stat. 646.642(3) (1997). In respondent's view, each of the thousands of pieces of promotional material containing a picture of the PST that Cooper distributed warranted the maximum fine. Brief for Respondent 49. Petitioner, on the other hand, argues that its preparation of a single \"mock-up\" for use in a single distribution would have been viewed as a single violation under the state statute. Reply Brief for Petitioner 2-3. The Court of Appeals expressed no opinion on this dispute. It did, however, observe that the unfairness in Cooper's use of the picture apparently had nothing to do with misleading customers but was related to its inability to obtain a \"mock-up\" quickly and cheaply. App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a. This observation is more consistent with the single-violation theory than with the notion that the statutory violation would have been sanctioned with a multimillion dollar fine.~    ~    ~      27~      We have made these comments on issues raised by application of the three Gore guidelines to the facts of this case, not to prejudge the answer to the constitutional question, but rather to illustrate why we are persuaded that the Court of Appeals' answer to that question may depend upon the standard of review. The de novo standard should govern its decision. Because the Court of Appeals applied a less demanding standard in this case, we vacate the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      28~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      29~      Justice Thomas, concurring.~    ~    ~      30~      Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment.~    ~    ~      31~      Justice Ginsburg, dissenting.~    ~    ~      ~        Notes~      ~      ~        1~         The ToolZall was marked with a different name than the PST, was held together with different fasteners, and, in the words of the Court of Appeals, \"included a serrated blade and certain other small but not particularly visible differences.\" Leatherman Tool Group v. Cooper Industries, 199 F.3d 1009, 1010 (CA9 1999).~      ~      ~        2~         To \"create\" the drawing, a Cooper manager photocopied a line-art drawing of a PST and then \"whited out\" Leatherman's trademark. App. 43-47.~      ~      ~        3~         Because this holding removed the predicate for the award of fees under the Lanham Act, see n. 2, supra, the Court of Appeals set aside that award and directed the District Court, on remand, to consider whether the evidence of passing off, standing alone, was sufficient to warrant a fee award. The Court of Appeals noted that the jury verdict form did not distinguish between passing off as a Lanham Act claim and passing off as a matter of state law. Although a fee award under 35(a) could not be supported unless the federal statute was violated, there is no reason to believe that any possible difference between federal and state passing off would affect the constitutionality of the punitive damages award.~      ~      ~        4~         Respondent and its amicus at times appear to conflate the question of the proper standard for reviewing the District Court's due process determination with the question of the substantive standard for determining the jury award's conformity with due process in the first instance. See Brief for Arthur F. McEvoy as Amicus Curiae 13 (\"[O]n appeal the litigant's objection to the substance of the jury's holding-whether on liability or damages-should be evaluated under a 'rational factfinder' standard ...\"); Brief for Respondent 13. The former is the question we agreed to review. The latter question has already been answered in BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 599 (1996). Thus, our rejection in TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U.S. 443 (1993), of \"heightened scrutiny\" of punitive damages awards, see id., at 456, is not only wholly consistent with our decision today, it is irrelevant to our resolution of the question presented.~      ~      ~        5~         See also Sunstein, Kahneman,  Schkade, Assessing Punitive Damages (With Notes on Cognition and Valuation in Law), 107 Yale L. J. 2071, 2074 (1998) (\"[P]unitive damages may have a retributive or expressive function, designed to embody social outrage at the action of serious wrongdoers\").~      ~      ~        6~         See Gore, 517 U.S., at 614-619 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Since our decision in Gore, four additional States have added punitive damages caps: Alabama, Alaska, North Carolina, and Ohio. See Ala. Code 6-11-21 (Supp. 2000); Alaska Stat. Ann. 09.17.020 (2000); N. C. Gen. Stat. 1D-25 (1999); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. 2315.21 (Supp. 2000).~      ~      ~        7~         In Browning-Ferris, the petitioner did argue that the award violated the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment, but we held the Clause inapplicable to punitive damages. The petitioner's reliance on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was unavailing because that argument had not been raised in the District Court, the Court of Appeals, or the certiorari petition. See 492 U.S., at 276-277.~      ~      ~        8~         Although disagreeing with the specific holding in Coker, Chief Justice Burger and then-Justice Rehnquist accepted the proposition that the \"concept of disproportionality bars the death penalty for minor crimes.\" 433 U.S., at 604 (Burger, C. J., dissenting).~      ~      ~        9~         Contrary to respondent's assertion, Brief for Respondent 12-13, our decision today is supported by our reasoning in Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U.S. 1, 20-21 (1991). In that case, we emphasized the importance of appellate review to ensuring that a jury's award of punitive damages comports with due process. See id., at 20-21 (\"[A]ppellate review makes certain that the punitive damages are reasonable in their amount and rational in light of their purpose to punish what has occurred and to deter its repetition\").~      ~      ~        10~         Respondent argues that our decision in Honda Motor Co. v. Oberg, 512 U.S. 415 (1994), rests upon the assumption that punitive damages awards are findings of fact. In that case, we held that the Oregon Constitution, which prohibits the reexamination of any \"fact tried by a jury,\" Ore. Const., Art. VII, 3, violated due process because it did not allow for any review of the constitutionality of punitive damages awards. Respondent claims that, because we considered this provision of the Oregon Constitution to cover punitive damages, we implicitly held that punitive damages are a \"fact tried by a jury.\" Brief for Respondent 27-28. It was the Oregon Supreme Court's interpretation of that provision, however, and not our own, that compelled the treatment of punitive damages as covered. See Oberg, 512 U.S., at 427; see also Van Lom v. Schneiderman, 187 Ore. 89, 93, 210 P.2d 461, 462 (1949) (construing the Oregon Constitution).~      ~      ~        11~         Nor does the historical material upon which respondent relies so extensively, see Brief for Respondent 19-24, conflict with our decision to require de novo review. Most of the sources respondent cites merely stand for the proposition that, perhaps because it is a fact-sensitive undertaking, determining the amount of punitive damages should be left to the discretion of the jury. See, e.g., Barry v. Edmunds, 116 U.S. 550, 565 (1886) (\"[I]t is the peculiar function of the jury\" to set the amount of punitive damages); Day v. Woodworth, 13 How. 363, 371 (1852) (punitive damages should be \"left to the discretion of the jury\"). They do not, however, indicate that the amount of punitive damages imposed by the jury is itself a \"fact\" within the meaning of the Seventh Amendment's Reexamination Clause. See Gasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc., 518 U.S. 415, 432 (1996) (distinguishing between the \"Trial by Jury\" Clause, which \"bears ... on the allocation of trial functions between judge and jury,\" and the \"Reexamination\" Clause, which \"controls the allocation of authority to review verdicts\"); see also id., at 447-448 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (same). In any event, punitive damages have evolved somewhat since the time of respondent's sources. Until well into the 19th century, punitive damages frequently operated to compensate for intangible injuries, compensation which was not otherwise available under the narrow conception of compensatory damages prevalent at the time. See Haslip, 499 U.S., at 61 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); see also Note, Exemplary Damages in the Law of Torts, 70 Harv. L. Rev. 517, 520 (1957) (observing a \"vacillation\" in the 19th-century cases between \"compensatory\" and \"punitive\" theories of \"exemplary damages\"). As the types of compensatory damages available to plaintiffs have broadened, see, e.g., 1 J. Nates, C. Kimball, D. Axelrod,  R. Goldstein, Damages in Tort Actions 3.01[3][a] (2000) (pain and suffering are generally available as species of compensatory damages), the theory behind punitive damages has shifted towards a more purely punitive (and therefore less factual) understanding. Cf. Note, 70 Harv. L. Rev., at 520 (noting a historical shift away from a compensatory-and towards a more purely punitive-conception of punitive damages).~      ~      ~        12~         The jury was instructed to consider the following factors: (1) \"The character of the defendant's conduct that is the subject of Leatherman's unfair competition claims\"; (2) \"The defendant's motive\"; (3) \"The sum of money that would be required to discourage the defendant and others from engaging in such conduct in the future\"; and (4) \"The defendant's income and assets.\" App. 14. Although the jury's application of these instructions may have depended on specific findings of fact, nothing in our decision today suggests that the Seventh Amendment would permit a court, in reviewing a punitive damages award, to disregard such jury findings. See, e.g., Gore, 517 U.S., at 579-580.~      ~      ~        13~         We express no opinion on the question whether Gasperini would govern-and de novo review would be inappropriate-if a State were to adopt a scheme that tied the award of punitive damages more tightly to the jury's finding of compensatory damages. This might be the case, for example, if the State's scheme constrained a jury to award only the exact amount of punitive damages it determined were necessary to obtain economically optimal deterrence or if it defined punitive damages as a multiple of compensatory damages (e.g., treble damages).~      ~      ~        14~         While we have determined that the Court of Appeals must review the District Court's application of the Gore test de novo, it of course remains true that Court of Appeals should defer to the District Court's findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. See United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U.S. 321, 336-337, n. 10 (1998).~      ~    ~    Thomas, J., concurring~    ~      32~      I continue to believe that the Constitution does not constrain the size of punitive damages awards. See BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 599 (1996) (Scalia, J., joined by Thomas, J., dissenting). For this reason, given the opportunity, I would vote to overrule BMW. This case, however, does not present such an opportunity. The only issue before us today is what standard should be used to review a trial court's ruling on a BMW challenge. Because I agree with the Court's resolution of that issue, I join the opinion of the Court.~    ~    Scalia, J., concurring~    ~      33~      I was (and remain) of the view that excessive punitive damages do not violate the Due Process Clause; but the Court held otherwise. See BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559 (1996); id., at 598 (Scalia, J., dissenting). And I was of the view that we should review for abuse of discretion (rather than de novo) fact-bound constitutional issues which, in their resistance to meaningful generalization, resemble the question of excessiveness of punitive damages-namely, whether there exists reasonable suspicion for a stop and probable cause for a search; but the Court held otherwise. See Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690 (1996); id., at 700 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Finally, in a case in which I joined a dissent that made it unnecessary for me to reach the issue, the Court categorically stated that \"the question whether a fine is constitutionally excessive calls for ... de novo review.\" United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U.S. 321, 336-337, n. 10 (1998); see id., at 344 (Kennedy, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor and Scalia, JJ., dissenting). Given these precedents, I agree that de novo review of the question of excessive punitive damages best accords with our jurisprudence. Accordingly, I concur in the judgment of the Court.~    ~    Ginsburg, J., dissenting~    ~      34~      In Gasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc., 518 U.S. 415 (1996), we held that appellate review of a federal trial court's refusal to set aside a jury verdict as excessive is reconcilable with the Seventh Amendment if \"appellate control [is] limited to review for 'abuse of discretion.' \" Id., at 419. Gasperini was a diversity action in which the defendant had challenged a compensatory damages award as excessive under New York law. The reasoning of that case applies as well to an action challenging a punitive damages award as excessive under the Constitution. I would hold, therefore, that the proper standard of appellate oversight is not de novo review, as the Court today concludes, but review for abuse of discretion.~    ~    ~      35~      \"An essential characteristic of [the federal court] system is the manner in which, in civil common-law actions, it distributes trial functions between judge and jury and, under the influence-if not the command-of the Seventh Amendment, assigns the decisions of disputed questions of fact to the jury.\" Id., at 432 (citing Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Cooperative, Inc., 356 U.S. 525, 537 (1958)). The Seventh Amendment provides: \"In Suits at common law ... the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.\" In Gasperini, we observed that although trial courts traditionally had broad authority at common law to set aside jury verdicts and to grant new trials, 518 U.S., at 432-433, \"appellate review of a federal trial court's denial of a motion to set aside a jury's verdict as excessive is a relatively late, and less secure, development,\" id., at 434. We ultimately concluded that the Seventh Amendment does not preclude such appellate review, id., at 436, but explained that \"[w]ithin the federal system, practical reasons combine with Seventh Amendment constraints to lodge in the district court, not the court of appeals, primary responsibility for application of [an excessiveness standard],\" id., at 438. \"Trial judges have the unique opportunity to consider the evidence in the living courtroom context,\" we said, \"while appellate judges see only the cold paper record.\" Ibid. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \"If [courts of appeals] reverse, it must be because of an abuse of discretion... . The very nature of the problem counsels restraint... . [Appellate courts] must give the benefit of every doubt to the judgment of the trial judge.\" Id., at 438-439 (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Dagnello v. Long Island R. Co., 289 F.2d 797, 806 (CA2 1961)).~    ~    ~      36~      Although Gasperini involved compensatory damages, I see no reason why its logic should be abandoned when punitive damages are alleged to be excessive. At common law, as our longstanding decisions reiterate, the task of determining the amount of punitive damages \"has [always been] left to the discretion of the jury.\" Day v. Woodworth, 13 How. 363, 371 (1852); see Barry v. Edmunds, 116 U.S. 550, 565 (1886) (\"[N]othing is better settled than that ... it is the peculiar function of the jury to determine the amount [of punitive damages] by their verdict.\"). The commitment of this function to the jury, we have explained, reflects the historical understanding that \"the degree of punishment to be thus inflicted must depend on the peculiar circumstances of each case.\" Day, 13 How., at 371. The relevant factors include \"the conduct and motives of the defendant\" and whether, \"in committing the wrong complained of, he acted recklessly, or wilfully and maliciously, with a design to oppress and injure the plaintiff.\" 1 J. Sutherland, Law of Damages 720 (1882). Such inquiry, the Court acknowledges, \"is a fact-sensitive undertaking.\" Ante, at 13, n. 11.~    ~    ~      37~      The Court nevertheless today asserts that a \"jury's award of punitive damages does not constitute a finding of 'fact' \" within the meaning of the Seventh Amendment. Ante, at 12. An ultimate award of punitive damages, it is true, involves more than the resolution of matters of historical or predictive fact. See ibid. (citing Gasperini, 518 U.S., at 459 (Scalia, J., dissenting)). But there can be no question that a jury's verdict on punitive damages is fundamentally dependent on determinations we characterize as factfindings-e.g., the extent of harm or potential harm caused by the defendant's misconduct, whether the defendant acted in good faith, whether the misconduct was an individual instance or part of a broader pattern, whether the defendant behaved negligently, recklessly, or maliciously. Punitive damages are thus not \"[u]nlike the measure of actual damages suffered,\" ante, at 12 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), in cases of intangible, noneconomic injury. One million dollars' worth of pain and suffering does not exist as a \"fact\" in the world any more or less than one million dollars' worth of moral outrage. Both derive their meaning from a set of underlying facts as determined by a jury. If one exercise in quantification is properly regarded as factfinding, see St. Louis, I. M.  S. R. Co. v. Craft, 237 U.S. 648, 661 (1915) (compensation for pain and suffering \"involves only a question of fact\"), it seems to me the other should be so regarded as well.~    ~    ~      38~      In Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U.S. 257 (1989), we approved application of an abuse-of-discretion standard for appellate review of a district court's ruling on a motion to set aside a punitive damages award as excessive. See id., at 279. Browning-Ferris reserved the question whether even such deferential appellate review might run afoul of the Seventh Amendment. At that time (i.e., pre-Gasperini), the Court \"ha[d] never held expressly that the Seventh Amendment allows appellate review of a district court's denial of a motion to set aside an award as excessive.\" 492 U.S., at 279, n. 25. We found it unnecessary to reach the Seventh Amendment question in Browning-Ferris because the jury verdict there survived lower court review intact. Id., at 279, n. 25, 280. Browning-Ferris, in short, signaled our recognition that appellate review of punitive damages, if permissible at all, would involve at most abuse-of-discretion review. \"[P]articularly ... because the federal courts operate under the strictures of the Seventh Amendment,\" we were \"reluctant to stray too far from traditional common-law standards, or to take steps which ultimately might interfere with the proper role of the jury.\" Id., at 280, n. 26.~    ~    ~      39~      The Court finds no incompatibility between this case and Browning-Ferris, observing that Browning-Ferris presented for our review an excessiveness challenge resting solely on state law, not on the Constitution. See ante, at 8, and n. 7. It is unclear to me why this distinction should make a difference. Of the three guideposts BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559 (1996), established for assessing constitutional excessiveness, two were derived from common-law standards that typically inform state law. See id., at 575, n. 24 (\"The principle that punishment should fit the crime is deeply rooted and frequently repeated in common-law jurisprudence.\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); id., at 580 (\"The principle that exemplary damages must bear a 'reasonable relationship' to compensatory damages has a long pedigree.\"). The third guidepost-comparability of sanctions for comparable misconduct-is not similarly rooted in common law, nor is it similarly factbound. As the Court states, \"the third Gore criterion ... calls for a broad legal comparison.\" Ante, at 16. But to the extent the inquiry is \"legal\" in character, there is little difference between review de novo and review for abuse of discretion. Cf. Gasperini, 518 U.S., at 448 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\"[I]t is a familiar ... maxim that deems an error of law an abuse of discretion.\").1~    ~    ~      40~      Apart from \"Seventh Amendment constraints,\" an abuse-of-discretion standard also makes sense for \"practical reasons.\" Id., at 438. With respect to the first Gore inquiry (i.e., reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct), district courts have an undeniably superior vantage over courts of appeals. As earlier noted, supra, at 2, district courts view the evidence not on a \"cold paper record,\" but \"in the living courtroom context,\" Gasperini, 518 U.S., at 438. They can assess from the best seats the vital matter of witness credibility. And \"it of course remains true that [a] Court of Appeals should defer to the District Court's findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous.\" Ante, at 15, n. 14.2~    ~    ~      41~      The Court recognizes that district courts have the edge on the first Gore factor, ante, at 15, but goes on to say that \"[t]rial courts and appellate courts seem equally capable of analyzing the second [Gore] factor\" (i.e., whether punitive damages bear a reasonable relationship to the actual harm inflicted), ante, at 16. Only \"the third Gore criterion [i.e., intrajurisdictional and interjurisdictional comparisons] ... seems more suited to the expertise of appellate courts.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      42~      To the extent the second factor requires a determination of \"the actual harm inflicted on the plaintiff,\" Gore, 517 U.S., at 580, district courts may be better positioned to conduct the inquiry, especially in cases of intangible injury. I can demur to the Court's assessment of relative institutional strengths, however, for even accepting that assessment, I would disagree with the Court's conclusion that \"[c]onsiderations of institutional competence ... fail to tip the balance in favor of deferential appellate review,\" ante, at 16. Gore itself assigned particular importance to the first inquiry, characterizing \"degree of reprehensibility\" as \"[p]erhaps the most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award.\" 517 U.S., at 575. District courts, as just noted, supra, at 5, have a superior vantage over courts of appeals in conducting that fact-intensive inquiry. Therefore, in the typical case envisioned by Gore, where reasonableness is primarily tied to reprehensibility, an appellate court should have infrequent occasion to reverse.~    ~    ~      43~      This observation, I readily acknowledge, suggests that the practical difference between the Court's approach and my own is not large. An abuse-of-discretion standard, as I see it, hews more closely to \"the strictures of the Seventh Amendment,\" Browning-Ferris, 492 U.S., at 280, n. 26. The Court's de novo standard is more complex. It requires lower courts to distinguish between ordinary common-law excessiveness and constitutional excessiveness, ante, at 8, and to separate out factfindings that qualify for \"clearly erroneous\" review, ante, at 15, n. 14. See also ante, at 15, n. 13 (suggesting abuse-of-discretion review might be in order \"if a State were to adopt a scheme that tied the award of punitive damages more tightly to the jury's finding of compensatory damages\"). The Court's approach will be challenging to administer. Complex as it is, I suspect that approach and mine will yield different outcomes in few cases.~    ~    ~      44~      The Ninth Circuit, I conclude, properly identified abuse of discretion as the appropriate standard in reviewing the District Court's determination that the punitive damages awarded against Cooper were not grossly excessive. For the Seventh Amendment and practical reasons stated, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.~    ~    ~      ~        Notes:~      ~      ~        1~         Appellate courts, following our instruction, apply de novo review to trial court determinations of reasonable suspicion, probable cause, and excessiveness of fines. See ante, at 10-11 (citing United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U.S. 321, 336-337, n. 10 (1998), and Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 696-698 (1996)). But such determinations typically are made without jury involvement, see, e.g., Bajakajian, 524 U.S., at 325-326; Ornelas, 517 U.S., at 694, and surely do not implicate the Seventh Amendment. Moreover, although Bajakajian said \"the question whether a [criminal] fine is constitutionally excessive calls for ... de novo review,\" 524 U.S., at 336-337, n. 10, Bajakajian did not disturb our holding in Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U.S. 257 (1989), that the \"Excessive Fines Clause does not apply to awards of punitive damages in [civil] cases between private parties,\" id., at 260.~      ~      ~        2~         An appellate court might be at a loss to accord such deference to jury findings of fact absent trial court employment of either a special verdict or a general verdict accompanied by written interrogatories.

ROGERS, PETITIONERv.TENNESSEE~    No. 99-6218.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued November 1, 2000~    Decided May 14, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      Following James Bowdery's death some 15 months after petitioner stabbed him, petitioner was convicted in Tennessee state court of second degree murder under the State's criminal homicide statute. Although that statute makes no mention of the common law \"year and a day rule\"-under which no defendant could be convicted of murder unless his victim died by the defendant's act within a year and a day of the act, see, e.g., Louisville, E.  St. L. R. Co. v. Clarke, 152 U.S. 230, 239-petitioner argued on appeal that the rule persisted as part of the State's common law and, as such, precluded his conviction. The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals disagreed and affirmed the conviction. In affirming, the State Supreme Court abolished the rule, finding that the reasons for recognizing the rule at common law no longer existed. The court disagreed with petitioner's contention that application of its decision abolishing the rule to his case would violate the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions, observing that those provisions refer only to legislative Acts. The court also concluded that application of its decision to petitioner would not run afoul of Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347, 354, in which this Court held that due process prohibits retroactive application of any judicial construction of a criminal statute that is unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which has been expressed prior to the conduct in issue.~      Held: The Tennessee Supreme Court's retroactive application to petitioner of its decision abolishing the year and a day rule did not deny petitioner due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 4-15.~      (a) To the extent petitioner argues that the Due Process Clause incorporates the specific prohibitions of the Ex Post Facto Clause, he misreads Bouie. Bouie contains some dicta suggestive of the broad interpretation for which petitioner argues, see, e.g., 378 U.S., at 353-354, but the decision was rooted firmly in well established notions of due process. Its rationale rested on core due process concepts of notice, foreseeability, and, in particular, the right to fair warning as those concepts bear on the constitutionality of attaching criminal penalties to what previously had been innocent conduct, see, e.g., id., at 351, 352, 354, 354-355. Subsequent decisions have not interpreted Bouie as extending so far as petitioner suggests, but have uniformly viewed Bouie as restricted to its traditional due process roots. In doing so, they have applied Bouie's check on retroactive judicial decisionmaking not by reference to the scope of the Ex Post Facto Clause, but, rather, in accordance with the more basic and general principle of fair warning that Bouie so clearly articulated. See, e.g., United States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 266. While petitioner's assertion that the two Clauses safeguard common interests is undoubtedly correct, he is mistaken to suggest that these considerations compel extending the Ex Post Facto Clause's strictures to the context of common law judging through the rubric of due process. Such an extension would circumvent the Ex Post Facto Clause's clear text, which expressly applies only to legislatures; would evince too little regard for the important institutional and contextual differences between legislating and common law decisionmaking; would be incompatible with the resolution of uncertainty that marks any evolving legal system; and would unduly impair the incremental and reasoned development of precedent that is the foundation of the common law system. It was on account of such concerns that Bouie restricted due process limitations on the retroactive application of judicial interpretations of criminal statutes to those that are unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in issue. See 378 U.S., at 354. That restriction adequately serves the common law context as well. Pp. 4-11.~      (b) The Tennessee court's abolition of the year and a day rule was not unexpected and indefensible. Advances in medical and related science have so undermined the rule's usefulness as to render it without question obsolete, and it has been legislatively or judicially abolished in the vast majority of jurisdictions recently to have addressed the issue. Despite petitioner's argument to the contrary, the fact that a vast number of jurisdictions outside Tennessee have abolished the rule is surely relevant to whether its abolition in his case, which involves the continuing viability of a common law rule, can be said to be unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law as it then existed. Bouie, supra, at 359-360, distinguished. Perhaps most importantly, at the time of petitioner's crime the rule had only the most tenuous foothold as part of Tennessee's criminal law. It did not exist as part of the State's statutory criminal code, and while the Tennessee Supreme Court concluded that the rule persisted at common law, it also pointedly observed that the rule had never once served as a ground of decision in any murder prosecution in the State. Indeed, in all the reported Tennessee cases, the rule has been mentioned only three times, and each time in dicta. These cases hardly suggest that the Tennessee court's decision was \"unexpected and indefensible\" such that it offended the due process principle of fair warning articulated in Bouie and its progeny. There is nothing to indicate that abolition of the rule in petitioner's case represented an exercise of the sort of unfair and arbitrary judicial action against which the Due Process Clause aims to protect. Far from a marked and unpredictable departure from prior precedent, the court's decision was a routine exercise of common law decisionmaking that brought the law into conformity with reason and common sense. Pp. 11-15.~      992 S.

J., and Kennedy, Souter, and Ginsburg, JJ., joined. Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion. Scalia, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Stevens and Thomas, JJ., joined, and in which Breyer, J., joined as to Part II. Breyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      This case concerns the constitutionality of the retroactive application of a judicial decision abolishing the common law \"year and a day rule.\" At common law, the year and a day rule provided that no defendant could be convicted of murder unless his victim had died by the defendant's act within a year and a day of the act. See, e.g., Louisville, E.  St. L. R. Co. v. Clarke, 152 U.S. 230, 239 (1894); 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 197-198 (1769). The Supreme Court of Tennessee abolished the rule as it had existed at common law in Tennessee and applied its decision to petitioner to uphold his conviction. The question before us is whether, in doing so, the court denied petitioner due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.~    ~    ~      2~      * Petitioner Wilbert K. Rogers was convicted in Tennessee state court of second degree murder. According to the undisputed facts, petitioner stabbed his victim, James Bowdery, with a butcher knife on May 6, 1994. One of the stab wounds penetrated Bowdery's heart. During surgery to repair the wound to his heart, Bowdery went into cardiac arrest, but was resuscitated and survived the procedure. As a result, however, he had developed a condition known as \"cerebral hypoxia,\" which results from a loss of oxygen to the brain. Bowdery's higher brain functions had ceased, and he slipped into and remained in a coma until August 7, 1995, when he died from a kidney infection (a common complication experienced by comatose patients). Approximately 15 months had passed between the stabbing and Bowdery's death which, according to the undisputed testimony of the county medical examiner, was caused by cerebral hypoxia \" 'secondary to a stab wound to the heart.' \" 992 S. W. 2d 393, 395 (Tenn. 1999).~    ~    ~      3~      Based on this evidence, the jury found petitioner guilty under Tennessee's criminal homicide statute. The statute, which makes no mention of the year and a day rule, defines criminal homicide simply as \"the unlawful killing of another person which may be first degree murder, second degree murder, voluntary manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide or vehicular homicide.\" Tenn. Code Ann. 39-13-201 (1997). Petitioner appealed his conviction to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, arguing that, despite its absence from the statute, the year and a day rule persisted as part of the common law of Tennessee and, as such, precluded his conviction. The Court of Criminal Appeals rejected that argument and affirmed the conviction. The court held that Tennessee's Criminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1989 (1989 Act), which abolished all common law defenses in criminal actions in Tennessee, had abolished the rule. See Tenn. Code Ann. 39-11-203(e)(2) (1997). The court also rejected petitioner's further contention that the legislative abolition of the rule constituted an ex post facto violation, noting that the 1989 Act had taken effect five years before petitioner committed his crime. No. 02C01-9611-CR-00418 (Tenn. Crim. App., Oct. 17, 1997), App. 7.~    ~    ~      4~      The Supreme Court of Tennessee affirmed on different grounds. The court observed that it had recognized the viability of the year and a day rule in Tennessee in Percer v. State, 118 Tenn. 765, 103 S. W. 780 (1907), and that, \"[d]espite the paucity of case law\" on the rule in Tennessee, \"both parties ... agree that the ... rule was a part of the common law of this State.\" 992 S. W. 2d, at 396. Turning to the rule's present status, the court noted that the rule has been legislatively or judicially abolished by the \"vast majority\" of jurisdictions recently to have considered the issue. Id., at 397. The court concluded that, contrary to the conclusion of the Court of Criminal Appeals, the 1989 Act had not abolished the rule. After reviewing the justifications for the rule at common law, however, the court found that the original reasons for recognizing the rule no longer exist. Accordingly, the court abolished the rule as it had existed at common law in Tennessee. Id., at 399-401.~    ~    ~      5~      The court disagreed with petitioner's contention that application of its decision abolishing the rule to his case would violate the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions. Those constitutional provisions, the court observed, refer only to legislative Acts. The court then noted that in Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347 (1964), this Court held that due process prohibits retroactive application of any \" 'judicial construction of a criminal statute [that] is unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which has been expressed prior to the conduct in issue.' \" 992 S. W. 2d, at 402 (quoting Bouie v. City of Columbia, supra, at 354) (alteration in original). The court concluded, however, that application of its decision to petitioner would not offend this principle. 992 S. W. 2d, at 402. We granted certiorari, 529 U.S. 1129 (2000), and we now affirm.~    ~    II~    ~      6~      Although petitioner's claim is one of due process, the Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause figures prominently in his argument. The Clause provides simply that \"[n]o State shall ... pass any ... ex post facto Law.\" Art. I, 10, cl. 1. The most well-known and oft-repeated explanation of the scope of the Clause's protection was given by Justice Chase, who long ago identified, in dictum, four types of laws to which the Clause extends:~    ~    ~      7~      \"1st. Every law that makes an action done before the passing of the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal; and punishes such action. 2d. Every law that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was, when committed. 3d. Every law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed. 4th. Every law that alters the legal rules of evidence, and receives less, or different, testimony, than the law required at the time of the commission of the offense, in order to convict the offender.\" Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390 (1798) (seriatim opinion of Chase, J.).~    ~    ~      8~      Accord, Carmell v. Texas, 529 U.S. 513, 521-525 (2000); Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U.S. 37, 41-42, 46 (1990). As the text of the Clause makes clear, it \"is a limitation upon the powers of the Legislature, and does not of its own force apply to the Judicial Branch of government.\" Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 191 (1977) (citation omitted).~    ~    ~      9~      We have observed, however, that limitations on ex post facto judicial decisionmaking are inherent in the notion of due process. In Bouie v. City of Columbia, we considered the South Carolina Supreme Court's retroactive application of its construction of the State's criminal trespass statute to the petitioners in that case. The statute prohibited \"entry upon the lands of another ... after notice from the owner or tenant prohibiting such entry ... .\" 378 U.S., at 349, n. 1 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The South Carolina court construed the statute to extend to patrons of a drug store who had received no notice prohibiting their entry into the store, but had refused to leave the store when asked. Prior to the court's decision, South Carolina cases construing the statute had uniformly held that conviction under the statute required proof of notice before entry. None of those cases, moreover, had given the \"slightest indication that that requirement could be satisfied by proof of the different act of remaining on the land after being told to leave.\" Id., at 357.~    ~    ~      10~      We held that the South Carolina court's retroactive application of its construction to the store patrons violated due process. Reviewing decisions in which we had held criminal statutes \"void for vagueness\" under the Due Process Clause, we noted that this Court has often recognized the \"basic principle that a criminal statute must give fair warning of the conduct that it makes a crime.\" Id., at 350; see id., at 350-352 (discussing, inter alia, United States v. Harriss, 347 U.S. 612 (1954), Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451 (1939), and Connally v. General Constr. Co., 269 U.S. 385 (1926)). Deprivation of the right to fair warning, we continued, can result both from vague statutory language and from an unforeseeable and retroactive judicial expansion of statutory language that appears narrow and precise on its face. Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S., at 352. For that reason, we concluded that \"[i]f a judicial construction of a criminal statute is 'unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in issue,' [the construction] must not be given retroactive effect.\" Id., at 354 (quoting J. Hall, General Principles of Criminal Law 61 (2d ed. 1960)). We found that the South Carolina court's construction of the statute violated this principle because it was so clearly at odds with the statute's plain language and had no support in prior South Carolina decisions. 378 U.S., at 356.~    ~    ~      11~      Relying largely upon Bouie, petitioner argues that the Tennessee court erred in rejecting his claim that the retroactive application of its decision to his case violates due process. Petitioner contends that the Ex Post Facto Clause would prohibit the retroactive application of a decision abolishing the year and a day rule if accomplished by the Tennessee Legislature. He claims that the purposes behind the Clause are so fundamental that due process should prevent the Supreme Court of Tennessee from accomplishing the same result by judicial decree. Brief for Petitioner 8-18. In support of this claim, petitioner takes Bouie to stand for the proposition that \"[i]n evaluating whether the retroactive application of a judicial decree violates Due Process, a critical question is whether the Constitution would prohibit the same result attained by the exercise of the state's legislative power.\" Brief for Petitioner 12.~    ~    ~      12~      To the extent petitioner argues that the Due Process Clause incorporates the specific prohibitions of the Ex Post Facto Clause as identified in Calder, petitioner misreads Bouie. To be sure, our opinion in Bouie does contain some expansive language that is suggestive of the broad interpretation for which petitioner argues. Most prominent is our statement that \"[i]f a state legislature is barred by the Ex Post Facto Clause from passing ... a law, it must follow that a State Supreme Court is barred by the Due Process Clause from achieving precisely the same result by judicial construction.\" 378 U.S., at 353-354; see also id., at 353 (\"[A]n unforeseeable judicial enlargement of a criminal statute, applied retroactively, operates precisely like an ex post facto law\"); id., at 362 (\"The Due Process Clause compels the same result\" as would the constitutional proscription against ex post facto laws \"where the State has sought to achieve precisely the same [impermissible] effect by judicial construction of the statute\"). This language, however, was dicta. Our decision in Bouie was rooted firmly in well established notions of due process. See supra, at 5. Its rationale rested on core due process concepts of notice, foreseeability, and, in particular, the right to fair warning as those concepts bear on the constitutionality of attaching criminal penalties to what previously had been innocent conduct. See, e.g., 378 U.S., at 351, 352, 354, 354-355. And we couched its holding squarely in terms of that established due process right, and not in terms of the ex post facto-related dicta to which petitioner points. Id., at 355 (concluding that \"the South Carolina Code did not give [the petitioners] fair warning, at the time of their conduct ... , that the act for which they now stand convicted was rendered criminal by the statute\"). Contrary to petitioner's suggestion, nowhere in the opinion did we go so far as to incorporate jot-for-jot the specific categories of Calder into due process limitations on the retroactive application of judicial decisions.~    ~    ~      13~      Nor have any of our subsequent decisions addressing Bouie-type claims interpreted Bouie as extending so far. Those decisions instead have uniformly viewed Bouie as restricted to its traditional due process roots. In doing so, they have applied Bouie's check on retroactive judicial decisionmaking not by reference to the ex post facto categories set out in Calder, but, rather, in accordance with the more basic and general principle of fair warning that Bouie so clearly articulated. See, e.g., United States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 266 (1997) (\"[D]ue process bars courts from applying a novel construction of a criminal statute to conduct that neither the statute nor any prior judicial decision has fairly disclosed to be within its scope\"); Marks v. United States, 430 U.S., at 191-192 (Due process protects against judicial infringement of the \"right to fair warning\" that certain conduct will give rise to criminal penalties); Rose v. Locke, 423 U.S. 48, 53 (1975) (per curiam) (upholding defendant's conviction under statute prohibiting \"crimes against nature\" because, unlike in Bouie, the defendant \"[could] make no claim that [the statute] afforded no notice that his conduct might be within its scope\"); Douglas v. Buder, 412 U.S. 430, 432 (1973) (per curiam) (trial court's construction of the term \"arrest\" as including a traffic citation, and application of that construction to defendant to revoke his probation, was unforeseeable and thus violated due process); Rabe v. Washington, 405 U.S. 313, 316 (1972) (per curiam) (reversing conviction under state obscenity law because it did \"not giv[e] fair notice\" that the location of the allegedly obscene exhibition was a vital element of the offense).~    ~    ~      14~      Petitioner observes that the Due Process and Ex Post Facto Clauses safeguard common interests-in particular, the interests in fundamental fairness (through notice and fair warning) and the prevention of the arbitrary and vindictive use of the laws. Brief for Petitioner 12-18. While this is undoubtedly correct, see, e.g., Lynce v. Mathis, 519 U.S. 433, 439-440, and n. 12 (1997), petitioner is mistaken to suggest that these considerations compel extending the strictures of the Ex Post Facto Clause to the context of common law judging. The Ex Post Facto Clause, by its own terms, does not apply to courts. Extending the Clause to courts through the rubric of due process thus would circumvent the clear constitutional text. It also would evince too little regard for the important institutional and contextual differences between legislating, on the one hand, and common law decisionmaking, on the other.~    ~    ~      15~      Petitioner contends that state courts acting in their common law capacity act much like legislatures in the exercise of their lawmaking function, and indeed may in some cases even be subject to the same kinds of political influences and pressures that justify ex post facto limitations upon legislatures. Brief for Petitioner 12-18; Reply Brief for Petitioner 15. A court's \"opportunity for discrimination,\" however, \"is more limited than [a] legislature's, in that [it] can only act in construing existing law in actual litigation.\" James v. United States, 366 U.S. 213, 247, n. 3 (1961) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Moreover, \"[g]iven the divergent pulls of flexibility and precedent in our case law system,\" ibid., incorporation of the Calder categories into due process limitations on judicial decisionmaking would place an unworkable and unacceptable restraint on normal judicial processes and would be incompatible with the resolution of uncertainty that marks any evolving legal system.~    ~    ~      16~      That is particularly so where, as here, the allegedly impermissible judicial application of a rule of law involves not the interpretation of a statute but an act of common law judging. In the context of common law doctrines (such as the year and a day rule), there often arises a need to clarify or even to reevaluate prior opinions as new circumstances and fact patterns present themselves. Such judicial acts, whether they be characterized as \"making\" or \"finding\" the law, are a necessary part of the judicial business in States in which the criminal law retains some of its common law elements. Strict application of ex post facto principles in that context would unduly impair the incremental and reasoned development of precedent that is the foundation of the common law system. The common law, in short, presupposes a measure of evolution that is incompatible with stringent application of ex post facto principles. It was on account of concerns such as these that Bouie restricted due process limitations on the retroactive application of judicial interpretations of criminal statutes to those that are \"unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in issue.\" Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S., at 354 (internal quotation marks omitted).~    ~    ~      17~      We believe this limitation adequately serves the common law context as well. It accords common law courts the substantial leeway they must enjoy as they engage in the daily task of formulating and passing upon criminal defenses and interpreting such doctrines as causation and intent, reevaluating and refining them as may be necessary to bring the common law into conformity with logic and common sense. It also adequately respects the due process concern with fundamental fairness and protects against vindictive or arbitrary judicial lawmaking by safeguarding defendants against unjustified and unpredictable breaks with prior law. Accordingly, we conclude that a judicial alteration of a common law doctrine of criminal law violates the principle of fair warning, and hence must not be given retroactive effect, only where it is \"unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in issue.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      18~      Justice Scalia makes much of the fact that, at the time of the framing of the Constitution, it was widely accepted that courts could not ''change'' the law, see post, at 5-7, 11-12 (dissenting opinion), and that (according to Justice Scalia) there is no doubt that the Ex Post Facto Clause would have prohibited a legislative decision identical to the Tennessee court's decision here, see post, at 3-4, 12. This latter argument seeks at bottom merely to reopen what has long been settled by the constitutional text and our own decisions: that the Ex Post Facto Clause does not apply to judicial decisionmaking. The former argument is beside the point. Common law courts at the time of the framing undoubtedly believed that they were finding rather than making law. But, however one characterizes their actions, the fact of the matter is that common law courts then, as now, were deciding cases, and in doing so were fashioning and refining the law as it then existed in light of reason and experience. Due process clearly did not prohibit this process of judicial evolution at the time of the framing, and it does not do so today.~    ~    III~    ~      19~      Turning to the particular facts of the instant case, the Tennessee court's abolition of the year and a day rule was not unexpected and indefensible. The year and a day rule is widely viewed as an outdated relic of the common law. Petitioner does not even so much as hint that good reasons exist for retaining the rule, and so we need not delve too deeply into the rule and its history here. Suffice it to say that the rule is generally believed to date back to the 13th century, when it served as a statute of limitations governing the time in which an individual might initiate a private action for murder known as an \"appeal of death\"; that by the 18th century the rule had been extended to the law governing public prosecutions for murder; that the primary and most frequently cited justification for the rule is that 13th century medical science was incapable of establishing causation beyond a reasonable doubt when a great deal of time had elapsed between the injury to the victim and his death; and that, as practically every court recently to have considered the rule has noted, advances in medical and related science have so undermined the usefulness of the rule as to render it without question obsolete. See, e.g., People v. Carrillo, 164 Ill. 2d 144, 150, 646 N. E. 2d 582, 585 (1995); Commonwealth v. Lewis, 381 Mass. 411, 414-415, 409 N. E. 2d 771, 772-773 (1980); People v. Stevenson, 416 Mich. 383, 391-392; 331 N. W. 2d 143, 146 (1982); State v. Hefler, 310 N. C. 135, 138-140, 310 S. E. 2d 310, 313 (1984); see generally Comment, 59 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1337 (1992) (tracing the history of the rule).~    ~    ~      20~      For this reason, the year and a day rule has been legislatively or judicially abolished in the vast majority of jurisdictions recently to have addressed the issue. See 992 S. W. 2d, at 397, n. 4 (reviewing cases and statutes). Citing Bouie, petitioner contends that the judicial abolition of the rule in other jurisdictions is irrelevant to whether he had fair warning that the rule in Tennessee might similarly be abolished and, hence, to whether the Tennessee court's decision was unexpected and indefensible as applied to him. Brief for Petitioner 28-30. In discussing the apparent meaning of the South Carolina statue in Bouie, we noted that \"[i]t would be a rare situation in which the meaning of a statute of another State sufficed to afford a person 'fair warning' that his own State's statute meant something quite different from what its words said.\" 378 U.S., at 359-360. This case, however, involves not the precise meaning of the words of a particular statute, but rather the continuing viability of a common law rule. Common law courts frequently look to the decisions of other jurisdictions in determining whether to alter or modify a common law rule in light of changed circumstances, increased knowledge, and general logic and experience. Due process, of course, does not require a person to apprise himself of the common law of all 50 States in order to guarantee that his actions will not subject him to punishment in light of a developing trend in the law that has not yet made its way to his State. At the same time, however, the fact that a vast number of jurisdictions have abolished a rule that has so clearly outlived its purpose is surely relevant to whether the abolition of the rule in a particular case can be said to be unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law as it then existed.~    ~    ~      21~      Finally, and perhaps most importantly, at the time of petitioner's crime the year and a day rule had only the most tenuous foothold as part of the criminal law of the State of Tennessee. The rule did not exist as part of Tennessee's statutory criminal code. And while the Supreme Court of Tennessee concluded that the rule persisted at common law, it also pointedly observed that the rule had never once served as a ground of decision in any prosecution for murder in the State. Indeed, in all the reported Tennessee cases, the rule has been mentioned only three times, and each time in dicta.~    ~    ~      22~      The first mention of the rule in Tennessee, and the only mention of it by the Supreme Court of that State, was in 1907 in Percer v. State, 118 Tenn. 765, 103 S. W. 780. In Percer, the court reversed the defendant's conviction for second degree murder because the defendant was not present in court when the verdict was announced and because the proof failed to show that the murder occurred prior to the finding of the indictment. In discussing the latter ground for its decision, the court quoted the rule that \"it is ... for the State to show that the crime was committed before the indictment was found, and, where it fails to do so, a conviction will be reversed.\" Id., at 777, 103 S. W., at 783 (quoting 12 Cyclopedia of Law and Procedure 382 (1904)). The court then also quoted the rule that \"[i]n murder, the death must be proven to have taken place within a year and a day from the date of the injury received.\" 118 Tenn., at 777, 103 S. W., at 783 (quoting F. Wharton, Law of Homicide 18 (3d ed. 1907)).~    ~    ~      23~      While petitioner relies on this case for the proposition that the year and a day rule was firmly entrenched in the common law of Tennessee, we agree with the Supreme Court of Tennessee that the case cannot establish nearly so much. After reciting the rules just mentioned, the court in Percer went on to point out that the indictment was found on July 6, 1906; that it charged that the murder was committed sometime in May 1906; and that the only evidence of when the victim died was testimony from a witness stating that he thought the death occurred sometime in July, but specifying neither a date nor a year. From this, the court concluded that it did \"not affirmatively appear\" from the evidence \"whether the death occurred before or after the finding of the indictment.\" 118 Tenn., at 777, 103 S. W., at 783. The court made no mention of the year and a day rule anywhere in its legal analysis or, for that matter, anywhere else in its opinion. Thus, whatever the import of the court's earlier quoting of the rule, it is clear that the rule did not serve as the basis for the Percer court's decision.~    ~    ~      24~      The next two references to the rule both were by the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals in cases in which the date of the victim's death was not even in issue. Sixty-seven years after Percer, the court in Cole v. State, 512 S. W. 2d 598 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1974), noted the existence of the rule in rejecting the defendants' contentions that insufficient evidence existed to support the jury's conclusion that they had caused the victim's death in a drag-racing crash. Id., at 601. Twenty-one years after that, in State v. Ruane, 912 S. W. 2d 766 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1995), a defendant referred to the rule in arguing that the operative cause of his victim's death was removal of life support rather than a gunshot wound at the defendant's hand. The victim had died within 10 days of receiving the wound. The Court of Criminal Appeals rejected the defendant's argument, concluding, as it had in this case, that the year and a day rule had been abolished by the 1989 Act. It went on to hold that the evidence of causation was sufficient to support the conviction. Id., at 773-777. Ruane, of course, was decided after petitioner committed his crime, and it concluded that the year and a day rule no longer existed in Tennessee for a reason that the high court of that State ultimately rejected. But we note the case nonetheless to complete our account of the few appearances of the common law rule in the decisions of the Tennessee courts.~    ~    ~      25~      These cases hardly suggest that the Tennessee court's decision was \"unexpected and indefensible\" such that it offended the due process principle of fair warning articulated in Bouie and its progeny. This is so despite the fact that, as Justice Scalia correctly points out, the court viewed the year and a day rule as a ''substantive principle'' of the common law of Tennessee. See post, at 14. As such, however, it was a principle in name only, having never once been enforced in the State. The Supreme Court of Tennessee also emphasized this fact in its opinion, see 992 S. W. 2d, at 402, and rightly so, for it is surely relevant to whether the court's abolition of the rule in petitioner's case violated due process limitations on retroactive judicial decisionmaking. And while we readily agree with Justice Scalia that fundamental due process prohibits the punishment of conduct that cannot fairly be said to have been criminal at the time the conduct occurred, see, e.g., post, at 4, 12, 14, nothing suggests that is what took place here.~    ~    ~      26~      There is, in short, nothing to indicate that the Tennessee court's abolition of the rule in petitioner's case represented an exercise of the sort of unfair and arbitrary judicial action against which the Due Process Clause aims to protect. Far from a marked and unpredictable departure from prior precedent, the court's decision was a routine exercise of common law decisionmaking in which the court brought the law into conformity with reason and common sense. It did so by laying to rest an archaic and outdated rule that had never been relied upon as a ground of decision in any reported Tennessee case.~    ~    ~      27~      The judgment of the Supreme Court of Tennessee is accordingly affirmed.~    ~    ~      28~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      29~      Justice Stevens, dissenting.~    ~    ~      30~      Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Stevens and Justice Thomas join, and with whom Justice Breyer joins as to Part II, dissenting.~    ~    ~      31~      Justice Breyer, dissenting.~    ~    Stevens, J., dissenting~    ~      32~      While I have joined Justice Scalia's entire dissent, I must add this brief caveat. The perception that common- law judges had no power to change the law was unquestionably an important aspect of our judicial heritage in the 17th century but, as he has explained, that perception has played a role of diminishing importance in later years. Whether the most significant changes in that perception occurred before the end of the 18th century or early in the 19th century is, in my judgment, a tangential question that need not be resolved in order to decide this case correctly. For me, far more important than the historical issue is the fact that the majority has undervalued the threat to liberty that is posed whenever the criminal law is changed retroactively.~    ~    Scalia, J., dissenting~    ~      33~      The Court today approves the conviction of a man for a murder that was not murder (but only manslaughter) when the offense was committed. It thus violates a principle-encapsulated in the maxim nulla poena sine lege-which \"dates from the ancient Greeks\" and has been described as one of the most \"widely held value-judgment[s] in the entire history of human thought.\" J. Hall, General Principles of Criminal Law 59 (2d ed. 1960). Today's opinion produces, moreover, a curious constitution that only a judge could love. One in which (by virtue of the Ex Post Facto Clause) the elected representatives of all the people cannot retroactively make murder what was not murder when the act was committed; but in which unelected judges can do precisely that. One in which the predictability of parliamentary lawmaking cannot validate the retroactive creation of crimes, but the predictability of judicial lawmaking can do so. I do not believe this is the system that the Framers envisioned-or, for that matter, that any reasonable person would imagine.~    ~    ~      34~      * A~    ~    ~      35~      To begin with, let us be clear that the law here was altered after the fact. Petitioner, whatever else he was guilty of, was innocent of murder under the law as it stood at the time of the stabbing, because the victim did not die until after a year and a day had passed. The requisite condition subsequent of the murder victim's death within a year and a day is no different from the requisite condition subsequent of the rape victim's raising a \"hue and cry\" which we held could not retroactively be eliminated in Carmell v. Texas, 529 U.S. 513 (2000). Here, as there, it operates to bar conviction. Indeed, if the present condition differs at all from the one involved in Carmell it is in the fact that it does not merely pertain to the \"quantum of evidence\" necessary to corroborate a charge, id., at 530, but is an actual element of the crime-a \"substantive principle of law,\" 992 S. W. 2d 393, 399 (Tenn. 1999), the failure to establish which \"entirely precludes a murder prosecution,\" id., at 400. Though the Court spends some time questioning whether the year-and-a-day rule was ever truly established in Tennessee, see ante, at 12-15, the Supreme Court of Tennessee said it was, see 992 S. W. 2d, at 396, 400, and this reasonable reading of state law by the State's highest court is binding upon us.~    ~    ~      36~      Petitioner's claim is that his conviction violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, insofar as that Clause contains the principle applied against the legislature by the Ex Post Facto Clause of Article I. We first discussed the relationship between these two Clauses in Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347 (1964). There, we considered Justice Chase to have spoken for the Court in Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390 (1798), when he defined an ex post facto law as, inter alia, one that \"aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was, when committed.\" 378 U.S., at 353 (emphasis deleted). We concluded that, \"[i]f a state legislature is barred by the Ex Post Facto Clause from passing such a law, it must follow that a State Supreme Court is barred by the Due Process Clause from achieving precisely the same result by judicial construction.\" Id., at 353-354. The Court seeks to avoid the obvious import of this language by characterizing it as mere dicta. See ante, at 7. Only a concept of dictum that includes the very reasoning of the opinion could support this characterization. The ratio decidendi of Bouie was that the principle applied to the legislature though the Ex Post Facto Clause was contained in the Due Process Clause insofar as judicial action is concerned. I cannot understand why the Court derives such comfort from the fact that later opinions applying Bouie have referred to the Due Process Clause rather than the Ex Post Facto Clause, see ante, at 7-8; that is entirely in accord with the rationale of the case, which I follow and which the Court discards.~    ~    ~      37~      The Court attempts to cabin Bouie by reading it to prohibit only \" 'unexpected and indefensible' \" judicial law revision, and to permit retroactive judicial changes so long as the defendant has had \"fair warning\" that the changes might occur. Ante, at 10. This reading seems plausible because Bouie does indeed use those quoted terms; but they have been wrenched entirely out of context. The \"fair warning\" to which Bouie and subsequent cases referred was not \"fair warning that the law might be changed,\" but fair warning of what constituted the crime at the time of the offense. And Bouie did not express disapproval of \"unexpected and indefensible changes in the law\" (and thus implicitly approve \"expected or defensible changes\"). It expressed disapproval of \"judicial construction of a criminal statute\" that is \"unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in issue.\" 378 U.S., at 354 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). It thus implicitly approved only a judicial construction that was an expected or defensible application of prior cases interpreting the statute. Extending this principle from statutory crimes to common-law crimes would result in the approval of retroactive holdings that accord with prior cases expounding the common law, and the disapproval of retroactive holdings that clearly depart from prior cases expounding the common law. According to Bouie, not just \"unexpected and indefensible\" retroactive changes in the common law of crimes are bad, but all retroactive changes.~    ~    ~      38~      Bouie rested squarely upon \"[t]he fundamental principle that 'the required criminal law must have existed when the conduct in issue occurred,' \" ibid. (Nulla poena sine lege.) Proceeding from that principle, Bouie said that \"a State Supreme Court is barred by the Due Process Clause from achieving precisely the same result [prohibited by the Ex Post Facto Clause] by judicial construction.\" Id., at 353-354. There is no doubt that \"fair warning\" of the legislature's intent to change the law does not insulate retroactive legislative criminalization. Such a statute violates the Ex Post Facto Clause, no matter that, at the time the offense was committed, the bill enacting the change was pending and assured of passage-or indeed, had already been passed but not yet signed by the President whose administration had proposed it. It follows from the analysis of Bouie that \"fair warning\" of impending change cannot insulate retroactive judicial criminalization either.~    ~    ~      39~      Nor is there any reason in the nature of things why it should. According to the Court, the exception is necessary because prohibiting retroactive judicial criminalization would \"place an unworkable and unacceptable restraint on normal judicial processes,\" would be \"incompatible with the resolution of uncertainty that marks any evolving legal system,\" and would \"unduly impair the incremental and reasoned development of precedent that is the foundation of the common law system.\" Ante, at 9. That assessment ignores the crucial difference between simply applying a law to a new set of circumstances and changing the law that has previously been applied to the very circumstances before the court. Many criminal cases present some factual nuance that arguably distinguishes them from cases that have come before; a court applying the penal statute to the new fact pattern does not purport to change the law. That, however, is not the action before us here, but rather, a square, head-on overruling of prior law-or, more accurately, something even more extreme than that: a judicial opinion acknowledging that under prior law, for reasons that used to be valid, the accused could not be convicted, but decreeing that, because of changed circumstances, \"we hereby abolish the common law rule,\" 922 S. W. 2d, at 401, and upholding the conviction by applying the new rule to conduct that occurred before the change in law was announced. Even in civil cases, and even in modern times, such retroactive revision of a concededly valid legal rule is extremely rare. With regard to criminal cases, I have no hesitation in affirming that it was unheard-of at the time the original Due Process Clause was adopted. As I discuss in detail in the following section, proceeding in that fashion would have been regarded as contrary to the judicial traditions embraced within the concept of due process of law.~    ~    B~    ~      40~      The Court's opinion considers the judgment at issue here \"a routine exercise of common law decisionmaking,\" whereby the Tennessee court \"brought the law into conformity with reason and common sense,\" by \"laying to rest an archaic and outdated rule.\" Ante, at 15. This is an accurate enough description of what modern \"common law decisionmaking\" consists of-but it is not an accurate description of the theoretical model of common-law decisionmaking accepted by those who adopted the Due Process Clause. At the time of the framing, common-law jurists believed (in the words of Sir Francis Bacon) that the judge's \"office is jus dicere, and not jus dare; to interpret law, and not to make law, or give law.\" Bacon, Essays, Civil and Moral, in 3 Harvard Classics 130 (C. Eliot ed. 1909) (1625). Or as described by Blackstone, whose Commentaries were widely read and \"accepted [by the framing generation] as the most satisfactory exposition of the common law of England,\" see Schick v. United States, 195 U.S. 65, 69 (1904), \"judicial decisions are the principal and most authoritative evidence, that can be given, of the existence of such a custom as shall form a part of the common law.\" 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England *69 (1765) (hereinafter Blackstone) (emphasis added).~    ~    ~      41~      Blackstone acknowledged that the courts' exposition of what the law was could change. Stare decisis, he said, \"admits of exception, where the former determination is most evidently contrary to reason . . . .\" Ibid. But \"in such cases the subsequent judges do not pretend to make a new law, but to vindicate the old one from misrepresentation.\" Id., at *70. To fit within this category of bad law, a law must be \"manifestly absurd or unjust.\" It would not suffice, he said, that \"the particular reason [for the law] can at this distance of time [not be] precisely assigned.\" \"For though [its] reason be not obvious at first view, yet we owe such a deference to former times as not to suppose they acted wholly without consideration.\" Ibid.1 By way of example, Blackstone pointed to the seemingly unreasonable rule that one cannot inherit the estate of one's half-brother. Though he accepted that the feudal reason behind the law was no longer obvious, he wrote \"yet it is not in [a common law judge's] power to alter it.\" Id., at *70- *71 (emphasis added).2 Moreover, \"the unreasonableness of a custom in modern circumstances will not affect its validity if the Court is satisfied of a reasonable origin.\" Allen 140-141. \"A custome once reasonable and tolerable, if after it become grievous, and not answerable to the reason, whereupon it was grounded, yet is to be . . . taken away by act of parliament.\" 2 E. Coke, Institutes of the Laws of England *664 (1642) (hereinafter Institutes); see also id., at *97 (\"No law, or custome of England can be taken away, abrogated, or adnulled, but by authority of parliament\"); Of Oaths before an Ecclesiastical Judge Ex Officio, 12 Co. Rep. *26, *29 (1655) (\"[T]he law and custom of England is the inheritance of the subject, which he cannot be deprived of without his assent in Parliament\").~    ~    ~      42~      There are, of course, stray statements and doctrines found in the historical record that-read out of context-could be thought to support the modern-day proposition that the common law was always meant to evolve. Take, for instance, Lord Coke's statement in the Institutes that \"the reason of the law ceasing, the law itself ceases.\" This maxim is often cited by modern devotees of a turbulently changing common law-often in its Latin form (cessante ratione legis, cessat ipse lex) to create the impression of great venerability. In its original context, however, it had nothing to do with the power of common-law courts to change the law. At the point at which it appears in the Institutes, Coke was discussing the exception granted abbots and mayors from the obligation of military service to the King which attached to land ownership. Such service would be impracticable for a man of the cloth or a mayor. But, said Coke, \"if they convey over the lands to any naturall man and his heires,\" the immunity \"by the conveyance over ceaseth.\" 1 Institutes *70. In other words, the service which attached to the land would apply to any subsequent owner not cloaked in a similar immunity. It was in describing this change that Coke employed the Latin maxim cessante ratione legis, cessat ipse lex. It had to do, not with a changing of the common-law rule, but with a change of circumstances that rendered the common-law rule no longer applicable to the case.~    ~    ~      43~      The same is true of the similar quotation from Coke: \"[R]atio legis est anima legis, et mutata legis ratione, mutatur et lex\"-reason is the soul of the law; the reason of the law being changed, the law is also changed. This is taken from Coke's report of Milborn's Case, 7 Co. Rep. 6b, 7a (1587), a suit involving a town's responsibility for a murder committed within its precincts. The common-law rule had been that a town could be amerced for failure to apprehend a murderer who committed his crime on its streets during the day, but not a murderer who struck after nightfall, when its citizens were presumably asleep. Parliament, however, enacted a statute requiring towns to close their gates at night, and the court reasoned that thereafter a town that left its gates open could be amerced for the nocturnal homicide as well, since the town's violation of the Act was negligence that facilitated the escape. This perhaps partakes more of a new right of action implied from legislation than of any common-law rule. But to the extent it involved the common law, it assuredly did not change the prior rule: A town not in violation of the statute would continue to be immune. Milborn's Case simply held that the rule would not be extended to towns that wrongfully failed to close their gates-which involves no overruling, but nothing more than normal, case-by-case common-law adjudication.~    ~    ~      44~      It is true that framing-era judges in this country considered themselves authorized to reject English common-law precedent they found \"barbarous\" and \"ignorant,\" see 1 Z. Swift, A System of the Laws of the State of Connecticut 46 (1795) (hereinafter Swift); N. Chipman, A Dissertation on the Act Adopting the Common and Statute Laws of England, in Reports and Dissertations 117, 128 (1793) (hereinafter Chipman). That, however, was not an assertion of judges' power to change the common law. For, as Blackstone wrote, the common law was a law for England, and did not automatically transfer to the American Colonies; rather, it had to be adopted. See 1 Blackstone *107-*108 (observing that \"the common law of England, as such, has no allowance or authority\" in \"[o]ur American plantations\"); see also 1 Swift 46 (\"The English common law is not in itself binding in this state\"); id., at 44-45 (\"The English common law has never been considered to be more obligatory here, than the Roman law has been in England\"). In short, the colonial courts felt themselves perfectly free to pick and choose which parts of the English common law they would adopt.3 As stated by Chipman, at 128, \"[i]f no reason can be assigned, in support of rules, or precedents, not already adopted in practice, to adopt such rules, is certainly contrary to the principles of our government\" (emphasis added). This discretion not to adopt would not presuppose, or even support, the power of colonial courts subsequently to change the accumulated colonial common law. The absence of belief in that power is demonstrated by the following passage from 1 M. Horwitz, The Transformation of American Law 1780-1860, p. 5 (1977) (hereinafter, Horwitz): \"Massachusetts Chief Justice Hutchison could declare in 1767 that 'laws should be established, else Judges and Juries must go according to their Reason, that is, their Will.' It was also imperative 'that the Judge should never be the Legislator: Because, then the Will of the Judge would be the Law: and this tends to a State of Slavery.' \" Or, as Judge Swift put it, courts \"ought never to be allowed to depart from the well known boundaries of express law, into the wide fields of discretion.\" 2 Swift 366.~    ~    ~      45~      Nor is the framing era's acceptance of common-law crimes support for the proposition that the Framers accepted an evolving common law. The acknowledgment of a new crime, not thitherto rejected by judicial decision, was not a changing of the common law, but an application of it. At the time of the framing, common-law crimes were considered unobjectionable, for \" 'a law founded on the law of nature may be retrospective, because it always existed,' \" Horwitz, at 7, quoting Blackwell v. Wilkinson, Jefferson's Rep. 73, 77 (Va. 1768) (argument of then-Attorney General John Randolph). Of course, the notion of a common-law crime is utterly anathema today, which leads one to wonder why that is so. The obvious answer is that we now agree with the perceptive chief justice of Connecticut, who wrote in 1796 that common-law crimes \"partak[e] of the odious nature of an ex post facto law.\" 2 Swift 365-366. But, as Horwitz makes clear, a widespread sharing of Swift's \"preoccupation with the unfairness of administering a system of judge-made criminal law was a distinctly post-revolutionary phenomenon, reflecting a profound change in sensibility. For the inarticulate premise that lay behind Swift's warnings against the danger of judicial discretion was a growing perception that judges no longer merely discovered law; they also made it.\" Horwitz 14-15 (emphases added). In other words, the connection between ex post facto lawmaking and common-law judging would not have become widely apparent until common-law judging became lawmaking, not (as it had been) law declaring. This did not happen, see id., at 1-4, until the 19th century, after the framing.~    ~    ~      46~      What occurred in the present case, then, is precisely what Blackstone said-and the Framers believed-would not suffice. The Tennessee Supreme Court made no pretense that the year-and-a-day rule was \"bad\" law from the outset; rather, it asserted, the need for the rule, as a means of assuring causality of the death, had disappeared with time. Blackstone-and the Framers who were formed by Blackstone-would clearly have regarded that change in law as a matter for the legislature, beyond the power of the court. It may well be that some common-law decisions of the era in fact changed the law while purporting not to. But that is beside the point. What is important here is that it was an undoubted point of principle, at the time the Due Process Clause was adopted, that courts could not \"change\" the law. That explains why the Constitution restricted only the legislature from enacting ex post facto laws. Under accepted norms of judicial process, an ex post facto law (in the sense of a judicial holding, not that a prior decision was erroneous, but that the prior valid law is hereby retroactively changed) was simply not an option for the courts. This attitude subsisted, I may note, well beyond the founding era, and beyond the time when due process guarantees were extended against the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. In an 1886 admiralty case, for example, this Court said the following: \"The rights of persons in this particular under the maritime law of this country are not different from those under the common law, and as it is the duty of courts to declare the law, not to make it, we cannot change this rule.\" The Harrisburg, 119 U.S. 199, 213-214 (1886), overruled by Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc., 398 U.S. 375 (1970).~    ~    ~      47~      It is not a matter, therefore, of \"[e]xtending the [Ex Post Facto] Clause to courts through the rubric of due process,\" and thereby \"circumvent[ing] the clear constitutional text,\" ante, at 8. It is simply a matter of determining what due judicial process consists of-and it does not consist of retroactive creation of crimes. The Ex Post Facto Clause is relevant only because it demonstrates beyond doubt that, however much the acknowledged and accepted role of common-law courts could evolve (as it has) in other respects, retroactive revision of the criminal law was regarded as so fundamentally unfair that an alteration of the judicial role which permits that will be a denial of due process. Madison wrote that \"ex-post-facto laws . . . are contrary to the first principles of the social compact, and to every principle of social legislation.\" The Federalist No. 44, p. 282 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). I find it impossible to believe, as the Court does, that this strong sentiment attached only to retroactive laws passed by the legislature, and would not apply equally (or indeed with even greater force) to a court's production of the same result through disregard of the traditional limits upon judicial power. Insofar as the \"first principles of the social compact\" are concerned, what possible difference does it make that \"[a] court's opportunity for discrimination\" by retroactively changing a law \"is more limited than a legislature's, in that it can only act in construing existing law in actual litigation\"? Ante, at 9 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The injustice to the individuals affected is no less.~    ~    II~    ~      48~      Even if I agreed with the Court that the Due Process Clause is violated only when there is lack of \"fair warning\" of the impending retroactive change, I would not find such fair warning here. It is not clear to me, in fact, what the Court believes the fair warning consisted of. Was it the mere fact that \"[t]he year and a day rule is widely viewed as an outdated relic of the common law\"? Ante, at 11. So are many of the elements of common-law crimes, such as \"breaking the close\" as an element of burglary, or \"asportation\" as an element of larceny. See W. LaFave  A. Scott, Criminal Law 631-633, 708-710 (1972). Are all of these \"outdated relics\" subject to retroactive judicial rescission? Or perhaps the fair warning consisted of the fact that \"the year and a day rule has been legislatively or judicially abolished in the vast majority of jurisdictions recently to have addressed the issue.\" Ante, at 11. But why not count in petitioner's favor (as giving him no reason to expect a change in law) those even more numerous jurisdictions that have chosen not \"recently to have addressed the issue\"? And why not also count in petitioner's favor (rather than against him) those jurisdictions that have abolished the rule legislatively, and those jurisdictions that have abolished it through prospective rather than retroactive judicial rulings (together, a large majority of the abolitions, see 922 S. W. 2d, at 397, n. 4, 402 (listing statutes and cases))? That is to say, even if it was predictable that the rule would be changed, it was not predictable that it would be changed retroactively, rather than in the prospective manner to which legislatures are restricted by the Ex Post Facto Clause, or in the prospective manner that most other courts have employed.~    ~    ~      49~      In any event, as the Court itself acknowledges, \"[d]ue process . . . does not require a person to apprise himself of the common law of all 50 States in order to guarantee that his actions will not subject him to punishment in light of a developing trend in the law that has not yet made its way to his State.\" Ante, at 12. The Court tries to counter this self-evident point with the statement that \"[a]t the same time, however, the fact that a vast number of jurisdictions have abolished a rule that has so clearly outlived its purpose is surely relevant to whether the abolition of the rule in a particular case can be said to be unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law as it then existed,\" ibid. This retort rests upon the fallacy that I discussed earlier: that \"expected or defensible\" \"abolition\" of prior law was approved by Bouie. It was not-and according such conclusive effect to the \"defensibility\" (by which I presume the Court means the \"reasonableness\") of the change in law will validate the retroactive creation of many new crimes.~    ~    ~      50~      Finally, the Court seeks to establish fair warning by discussing at great length, ante, at 12-15, how unclear it was that the year-and-a-day rule was ever the law in Tennessee. As I have already observed, the Supreme Court of Tennessee is the authoritative expositor of Tennessee law, and has said categorically that the year-and-a-day rule was the law. Does the Court mean to establish the principle that fair warning of impending change exists-or perhaps fair warning can be dispensed with-when the prior law is not crystal clear? Yet another boon for retroactively created crimes.~    ~    ~      51~      I reiterate that the only \"fair warning\" discussed in our precedents, and the only \"fair warning\" relevant to the issue before us here, is fair warning of what the law is. That warning, unlike the new one that today's opinion invents, goes well beyond merely \"safeguarding defendants against unjustified and unpredictable breaks with prior law,\" ante, at 10 (emphasis added). It safeguards them against changes in the law after the fact. But even accepting the Court's novel substitute, the opinion's conclusion that this watered-down standard has been met seems to me to proceed on the principle that a large number of almost-valid arguments makes a solid case. As far as I can tell, petitioner had nothing that could fairly be called a \"warning\" that the Supreme Court of Tennessee would retroactively eliminate one of the elements of the crime of murder.~    ~    ~      52~      * * *~    ~    ~      53~      To decide this case, we need only conclude that due process prevents a court from (1) acknowledging the validity, when they were rendered, of prior decisions establishing a particular element of a crime; (2) changing the prior law so as to eliminate that element; and (3) applying that change to conduct that occurred under the prior regime. A court would remain free to apply common-law criminal rules to new fact patterns, see ante, at 9-10, so long as that application is consistent with a fair reading of prior cases. It would remain free to conclude that a prior decision or series of decisions establishing a particular element of a crime was in error, and to apply that conclusion retroactively (so long as the \"fair notice\" requirement of Bouie is satisfied). It would even remain free, insofar as the ex post facto element of the Due Process Clause is concerned, to \"reevaluat[e] and refin[e]\" the elements of common-law crimes to its heart's content, so long as it does so prospectively. (The majority of state courts that have abolished the year-and-a-day rule have done so in this fashion.) And, of course (as Blackstone and the Framers envisioned), legislatures would be free to eliminate outmoded elements of common-law crimes for the future by law. But what a court cannot do, consistent with due process, is what the Tennessee Supreme Court did here: avowedly change (to the defendant's disadvantage) the criminal law governing past acts.~    ~    ~      54~      For these reasons, I would reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Tennessee.~    ~    ~      ~        Notes:~      ~      ~        1~         Inquiring into a law's original reasonableness was perhaps tantamount to questioning whether it existed at all. \"In holding the origin to have been unreasonable, the Court nearly always doubts or denies the actual origin and continuance of the custom in fact.\" C. Allen, Law in the Making 140 (3d ed. 1939) (hereinafter Allen).~      ~      ~        2~         The near-dispositive strength Blackstone accorded stare decisis was not some mere personal predilection. Chancellor Kent was of the same view: \"If a decision has been made upon solemn argument and mature deliberation, the presumption is in favor of its correctness; and the community have a right to regard it as a just declaration or exposition of the law, and to regulate their actions and contracts by it.\" 1 J. Kent, Commentaries *475-*476 (emphasis added). See also Hamilton's statement in The Federalist: \"To avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is indispensable that they should be bound down by strict rules and precedents which serve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that comes before them.\" The Federalist No. 78, p. 471 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).~      ~      ~        3~         In fact, however, \"most of the basic departures [from English common law] were accomplished not by judicial decision but by local statute, so that by the time of the American Revolution one hears less and less about the unsuitability of common law principles to the American environment.\" 1 M. Horwitz, Transformation of American Law 1780-1860, p. 5 (1977).~      ~    ~    Breyer, J., dissenting~    ~      55~      I agree with the Court's basic approach. Justice Cardozo pointed out that retroactivity should be determined \"not by metaphysical conceptions of the nature of judge-made law, ... but by considerations of convenience, of utility, and of the deepest sentiments of justice.\" The Nature of the Judicial Process 148-149 (1921). Similarly, the Due Process Clause asks us to consider the basic fairness or unfairness of retroactive application of the Tennessee court's change in the law. That Clause provides protection against after-the-fact changes in criminal law that deprive defendants of fair warning of the nature and consequences of their actions. It does not enshrine Blackstone's \"ancient dogma that the law declared by ... courts had a Platonic or ideal existence before the act of declaration,\" Great Northern R. Co. v. Sunburst Oil  Refining Co., 287 U.S. 358, 365 (1932) (Cardozo, J.). Cf. ante, at 7-8 (Scalia, J., dissenting).~    ~    ~      56~      I also agree with the Court that, in applying the Due Process Clause, we must ask whether the judicial ruling in question was \"unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in issue.\" Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347, 354 (1964) (quoting J. Hall, General Principles of Criminal Law 61 (2d ed. 1960) (internal quotation marks omitted)).~    ~    ~      57~      I cannot agree, however, with the majority's application of that due process principle to this case. As Justice Scalia well explains, Rogers did not have fair warning that the Tennessee courts would abolish the year and a day rule or that they would retroactively apply the new law to the circumstances of his case, thereby upgrading the crime those circumstances revealed from attempted murder to murder. I therefore join Part II of Justice Scalia's dissenting opinion.~    ~    ",

Readers are requested to notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D. C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.UNITED STATES, PETITIONERv.OAKLAND CANNABIS BUYERS' COOPERATIVE and JEFFREY JONES~    No. 00-151.~    Supreme Court of the United States~    Argued March 28, 2001~    Decided May 14, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      Respondent Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative was organized to distribute marijuana to qualified patients for medical purposes. The United States sued to enjoin the Cooperative and its executive director, also a respondent (together, the Cooperative), under the Controlled Substances Act. The United States argued that the Cooperative's activities violated the Act's prohibitions on distributing, manufacturing, and possessing with the intent to distribute or manufacture a controlled substance. The District Court enjoined the Cooperative's activities, but the Cooperative continued to distribute marijuana. The District Court found the Cooperative in contempt, rejecting its defense that any distributions were medically necessary. The court later rejected the Cooperative's motion to modify the injunction to permit medically necessary distributions. The Cooperative appealed, and the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded the ruling on the motion to modify the injunction. According to the Ninth Circuit, medical necessity is a legally cognizable defense likely applicable in the circumstances, the District Court mistakenly believed it had no discretion to issue an injunction more limited in scope than the Controlled Substances Act, and the District Court should have weighed the public interest and considered factors such as the serious harm in depriving patients of marijuana in deciding whether to modify the injunction.~      Held:    1. There is no medical necessity exception to the Controlled Substances Act's prohibitions on manufacturing and distributing marijuana. Pp. 5-11.~      (a) Because that Act classifies marijuana as a schedule I controlled substance, it provides only one express exception to the prohibitions on manufacturing and distributing the drug: Government-approved research projects. The Cooperative's contention that a common-law medical necessity defense should be written into the Act is rejected. There is an open question whether federal courts ever have authority to recognize a necessity defense not provided by statute. But that question need not be answered to resolve the issue presented here, for the terms of the Controlled Substances Act leave no doubt that the medical necessity defense is unavailable. Pp. 5-7.~      (b) Under any conception of legal necessity, the defense cannot succeed when the legislature itself has made a determination of values. Here, the Act reflects a determination that marijuana has no medical benefits worthy of an exception (other than Government-approved research). Whereas other drugs can be dispensed and prescribed for medical use, see 21 U.S. C. 829, the same is not true for marijuana, which has \"no currently accepted medial use\" at all, 811. This conclusion is supported by the structure of the Act, which divides drugs into five schedules, depending in part on whether a drug has a currently accepted medical use, and then imposes restrictions according to the schedule in which it has been placed. The Attorney General is authorized to include a drug in schedule I, the most restrictive schedule, only if the drug has no currently accepted medical use. The Cooperative errs in arguing that, because Congress, instead of the Attorney General, placed marijuana into that schedule, marijuana can be distributed when medically necessary. The statute treats all schedule I drugs alike, and there is no reason why drugs that Congress placed there should be subject to fewer controls than those that the Attorney General placed there. Also rejected is the Cooperative's argument that a drug may be found medically necessary for a particular patient or class even when it has not achieved general acceptance as a medical treatment. It is clear from the text of the Act that Congress determined that marijuana has no medical benefits worthy of an exception granted to other drugs. The statute expressly contemplates that many drugs have a useful medical purpose, see 801(1), but it includes no exception at all for any medical use of marijuana. This Court is unwilling to view that omission as an accident and is unable, in any event, to override a legislative determination manifest in the statute. Finally, the canon of constitutional avoidance has no application here, because there is no statutory ambiguity. Pp. 7-11.~      2. The discretion that courts of equity traditionally possess in fashioning relief does not serve as a basis for affirming the Ninth Circuit in this case. To be sure, district courts properly acting as courts of equity have discretion unless a statute clearly provides otherwise. But the mere fact that the District Court had discretion does not suggest that the court, when evaluating the motion, could consider any and all factors that might relate to the public interest or the parties' conveniences, including medical needs. Equity courts cannot ignore Congress' judgment expressed in legislation. Their choice is whether a particular means of enforcement should be chosen over another permissible means, not whether enforcement is preferable to no enforcement at all. To the extent a district court considers the public interest and parties' conveniences, the court is limited to evaluating how those factors are affected by the selection of an injunction over other enforcement mechanisms. Because the Controlled Substances Act covers even those who have what could be termed a medical necessity, it precludes consideration of the evidence that the Ninth Circuit deemed relevant.~      Pp. 11-15. 190 F.3d 1109, reversed and remanded.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT~      Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor, Scalia, and Kennedy, JJ., joined. Stevens, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Souter and Ginsburg, JJ., joined. Breyer, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      The Controlled Substances Act, 84 Stat. 1242, 21 U.S.C.  801 et seq., prohibits the manufacture and distribution of various drugs, including marijuana. In this case, we must decide whether there is a medical necessity exception to these prohibitions. We hold that there is not.~    ~    ~      2~      * In November 1996, California voters enacted an initiative measure entitled the Compassionate Use Act of 1996. Attempting \"[t]o ensure that seriously ill Californians have the right to obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes,\" Cal. Health  Safety Code Ann. 11362.5 (West Supp. 2001), the statute creates an exception to California laws prohibiting the possession and cultivation of marijuana. These prohibitions no longer apply to a patient or his primary caregiver who possesses or cultivates marijuana for the patient's medical purposes upon the recommendation or approval of a physician. Ibid. In the wake of this voter initiative, several groups organized \"medical cannabis dispensaries\" to meet the needs of qualified patients. United States v. Cannabis Cultivators Club, 5 F. Supp. 2d 1086, 1092 (ND Cal. 1998). Respondent Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative is one of these groups.~    ~    ~      3~      The Cooperative is a not-for-profit organization that operates in downtown Oakland. A physician serves as medical director, and registered nurses staff the Cooperative during business hours. To become a member, a patient must provide a written statement from a treating physician assenting to marijuana therapy and must submit to a screening interview. If accepted as a member, the patient receives an identification card entitling him to obtain marijuana from the Cooperative.~    ~    ~      4~      In January 1998, the United States sued the Cooperative and its executive director, respondent Jeffrey Jones (together, the Cooperative), in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Seeking to enjoin the Cooperative from distributing and manufacturing marijuana,1 the United States argued that, whether or not the Cooperative's activities are legal under California law, they violate federal law. Specifically, the Government argued that the Cooperative violated the Controlled Substances Act's prohibitions on distributing, manufacturing, and possessing with the intent to distribute or manufacture a controlled substance. 21 U.S.C.  841(a). Concluding that the Government had established a probability of success on the merits, the District Court granted a preliminary injunction. App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a-40a, 5 F. Supp. 2d, at 1105.~    ~    ~      5~      The Cooperative did not appeal the injunction but instead openly violated it by distributing marijuana to numerous persons, App. to Pet. for Cert. at 21a-23a. To terminate these violations, the Government initiated contempt proceedings. In defense, the Cooperative contended that any distributions were medically necessary. Marijuana is the only drug, according to the Cooperative, that can alleviate the severe pain and other debilitating symptoms of the Cooperative's patients. Id., at 29a. The District Court rejected this defense, however, after determining there was insufficient evidence that each recipient of marijuana was in actual danger of imminent harm without the drug. Id., at 29a-32a. The District Court found the Cooperative in contempt and, at the Government's request, modified the preliminary injunction to empower the United States Marshal to seize the Cooperative's premises. Id., at 37a. Although recognizing that \"human suffering\" could result, the District Court reasoned that a court's \"equitable powers [do] not permit it to ignore federal law.\" Ibid. Three days later, the District Court summarily rejected a motion by the Cooperative to modify the injunction to permit distributions that are medically necessary.~    ~    ~      6~      The Cooperative appealed both the contempt order and the denial of the Cooperative's motion to modify. Before the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit decided the case, however, the Cooperative voluntarily purged its contempt by promising the District Court that it would comply with the initial preliminary injunction. Consequently, the Court of Appeals determined that the appeal of the contempt order was moot. 190 F.3d 1109, 1112-1113 (1999).~    ~    ~      7~      The denial of the Cooperative's motion to modify the injunction, however, presented a live controversy that was appealable under 28 U.S.C.  1292(a)(1). Reaching the merits of this issue, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded. According to the Court of Appeals, the medical necessity defense was a \"legally cognizable defense\" that likely would apply in the circumstances. 190 F.3d, at 1114. Moreover, the Court of Appeals reasoned, the District Court erroneously \"believed that it had no discretion to issue an injunction that was more limited in scope than the Controlled Substances Act itself.\" Id., at 1114-1115. Because, according to the Court of Appeals, district courts retain \"broad equitable discretion\" to fashion injunctive relief, the District Court could have, and should have, weighed the \"public interest\" and considered factors such as the serious harm in depriving patients of marijuana. Ibid. Remanding the case, the Court of Appeals instructed the District Court to consider \"the criteria for a medical necessity exemption, and, should it modify the injunction, to set forth those criteria in the modification order.\" Id., at 1115. Following these instructions, the District Court granted the Cooperative's motion to modify the injunction to incorporate a medical necessity defense.2~    ~    ~      8~      The United States petitioned for certiorari to review the Court of Appeals' decision that medical necessity is a legally cognizable defense to violations of the Controlled Substances Act. Because the decision raises significant questions as to the ability of the United States to enforce the Nation's drug laws, we granted certiorari. 531 U.S. 1010 (2000).~    ~    II~    ~      9~      The Controlled Substances Act provides that, \"[e]xcept as authorized by this subchapter, it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally ... to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance.\" 21 U.S.C.  841(a)(1). The subchapter, in turn, establishes exceptions. For marijuana (and other drugs that have been classified as \"schedule I\" controlled substances), there is but one express exception, and it is available only for Government-approved research projects, 823(f). Not conducting such a project, the Cooperative cannot, and indeed does not, claim this statutory exemption.~    ~    ~      10~      The Cooperative contends, however, that notwithstanding the apparently absolute language of 841(a), the statute is subject to additional, implied exceptions, one of which is medical necessity. According to the Cooperative, because necessity was a defense at common law, medical necessity should be read into the Controlled Substances Act. We disagree.~    ~    ~      11~      As an initial matter, we note that it is an open question whether federal courts ever have authority to recognize a necessity defense not provided by statute. A necessity defense \"traditionally covered the situation where physical forces beyond the actor's control rendered illegal conduct the lesser of two evils.\" United States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394, 410 (1980). Even at common law, the defense of necessity was somewhat controversial. See, e.g., Queen v. Dudley  Stephens, 14 Q. B. 273 (1884). And under our constitutional system, in which federal crimes are defined by statute rather than by common law, see United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch 32, 34 (1812), it is especially so. As we have stated: \"Whether, as a policy matter, an exemption should be created is a question for legislative judgment, not judicial inference.\" United States v. Rutherford, 442 U.S. 544, 559 (1979). Nonetheless, we recognize that this Court has discussed the possibility of a necessity defense without altogether rejecting it. See, e.g., Bailey, supra, at 415.3~    ~    ~      12~      We need not decide, however, whether necessity can ever be a defense when the federal statute does not expressly provide for it. In this case, to resolve the question presented, we need only recognize that a medical necessity exception for marijuana is at odds with the terms of the Controlled Substances Act. The statute, to be sure, does not explicitly abrogate the defense.4 But its provisions leave no doubt that the defense is unavailable.~    ~    ~      13~      Under any conception of legal necessity, one principle is clear: The defense cannot succeed when the legislature itself has made a \"determination of values.\" 1 W. LaFave  A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law 5.4, p. 629 (1986). In the case of the Controlled Substances Act, the statute reflects a determination that marijuana has no medical benefits worthy of an exception (outside the confines of a Government-approved research project). Whereas some other drugs can be dispensed and prescribed for medical use, see 21 U.S.C.  829 the same is not true for marijuana. Indeed, for purposes of the Controlled Substances Act, marijuana has \"no currently accepted medical use\" at all. 811.~    ~    ~      14~      The structure of the Act supports this conclusion. The statute divides drugs into five schedules, depending in part on whether the particular drug has a currently accepted medical use. The Act then imposes restrictions on the manufacture and distribution of the substance according to the schedule in which it has been placed. Schedule I is the most restrictive schedule.5 The Attorney General can include a drug in schedule I only if the drug \"has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States,\" \"has a high potential for abuse,\" and has \"a lack of accepted safety for use ... under medical supervision.\" 812(b)(1)(A)-(C). Under the statute, the Attorney General could not put marijuana into schedule I if marijuana had any accepted medical use.~    ~    ~      15~      The Cooperative points out, however, that the Attorney General did not place marijuana into schedule I. Congress put it there, and Congress was not required to find that a drug lacks an accepted medical use before including the drug in schedule I. We are not persuaded that this distinction has any significance to our inquiry. Under the Cooperative's logic, drugs that Congress places in schedule I could be distributed when medically necessary whereas drugs that the Attorney General places in schedule I could not. Nothing in the statute, however, suggests that there are two tiers of schedule I narcotics, with drugs in one tier more readily available than drugs in the other. On the contrary, the statute consistently treats all schedule I drugs alike. See, e.g., 823(a) (providing criteria for Attorney General to consider when determining whether to register an applicant to manufacture schedule I controlled substances), 823(b) (providing criteria for Attorney General to consider when determining whether to register an applicant to distribute schedule I controlled substances), 823(f) (providing procedures for becoming a government-approved research project), 826 (establishing production quotas for schedule I drugs). Moreover, the Cooperative offers no convincing explanation for why drugs that Congress placed on schedule I should be subject to fewer controls than the drugs that the Attorney General placed on the schedule. Indeed, the Cooperative argues that, in placing marijuana and other drugs on schedule I, Congress \"wishe[d] to assert the most restrictive level of controls created by the [Controlled Substances Act].\" Brief for Respondents 24. If marijuana should be subject to the most restrictive level of controls, it should not be treated any less restrictively than other schedule I drugs.~    ~    ~      16~      The Cooperative further argues that use of schedule I drugs generally-whether placed in schedule I by Congress or the Attorney General-can be medically necessary, notwithstanding that they have \"no currently accepted medical use.\" According to the Cooperative, a drug may not yet have achieved general acceptance as a medical treatment but may nonetheless have medical benefits to a particular patient or class of patients. We decline to parse the statute in this manner. It is clear from the text of the Act that Congress has made a determination that marijuana has no medical benefits worthy of an exception. The statute expressly contemplates that many drugs \"have a useful and legitimate medical purpose and are necessary to maintain the health and general welfare of the American people,\" 801(1), but it includes no exception at all for any medical use of marijuana. Unwilling to view this omission as an accident, and unable in any event to override a legislative determination manifest in a statute, we reject the Cooperative's argument.6~    ~    ~      17~      Finally, the Cooperative contends that we should construe the Controlled Substances Act to include a medical necessity defense in order to avoid what it considers to be difficult constitutional questions. In particular, the Cooperative asserts that, shorn of a medical necessity defense, the statute exceeds Congress' Commerce Clause powers, violates the substantive due process rights of patients, and offends the fundamental liberties of the people under the Fifth, Ninth, and Tenth Amendments. As the Cooperative acknowledges, however, the canon of constitutional avoidance has no application in the absence of statutory ambiguity. Because we have no doubt that the Controlled Substances Act cannot bear a medical necessity defense to distributions of marijuana, we do not find guidance in this avoidance principle. Nor do we consider the underlying constitutional issues today. Because the Court of Appeals did not address these claims, we decline to do so in the first instance.~    ~    ~      18~      For these reasons, we hold that medical necessity is not a defense to manufacturing and distributing marijuana.7 The Court of Appeals erred when it held that medical necessity is a \"legally cognizable defense.\" 190 F.3d, at 1114. It further erred when it instructed the District Court on remand to consider \"the criteria for a medical necessity exemption, and, should it modify the injunction, to set forth those criteria in the modification order.\" Id., at 1115.~    ~    III~    ~      19~      The Cooperative contends that, even if the Controlled Substances Act forecloses the medical necessity defense, there is an alternative ground for affirming the Court of Appeals. This case, the Cooperative reminds us, arises from a motion to modify an injunction to permit distributions that are medically necessary. According to the Cooperative, the Court of Appeals was correct that the District Court had \"broad equitable discretion\" to tailor the injunctive relief to account for medical necessity, irrespective of whether there is a legal defense of necessity in the statute. Id., at 1114. To sustain the judgment below, the argument goes, we need only reaffirm that federal courts, in the exercise of their equity jurisdiction, have discretion to modify an injunction based upon a weighing of the public interest.8~    ~    ~      20~      We disagree. Although district courts whose equity powers have been properly invoked indeed have discretion in fashioning injunctive relief (in the absence of a statutory restriction), the Court of Appeals erred concerning the factors that the district courts may consider in exercising such discretion.~    ~    ~      21~      * As an initial matter, the Cooperative is correct that, when district courts are properly acting as courts of equity, they have discretion unless a statute clearly provides otherwise. For \"several hundred years,\" courts of equity have enjoyed \"sound discretion\" to consider the \"necessities of the public interest\" when fashioning injunctive relief. Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321, 329-330 (1944). See also id., at 329 (\"The essence of equity jurisdiction has been the power of the Chancellor to do equity and to mould each decree to the necessities of the particular case. Flexibility rather than rigidity has distinguished it\"); Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 312 (1982) (\"In exercising their sound discretion, courts of equity should pay particular regard for the public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of injunction\"). Such discretion is displaced only by a \"clear and valid legislative command.\" Porter v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U.S. 395, 398 (1946). See also Romero-Barcelo, supra, at 313 (\"Of course, Congress may intervene and guide or control the exercise of the courts' discretion, but we do not lightly assume that Congress has intended to depart from established principles\").~    ~    ~      22~      The Cooperative is also correct that the District Court in this case had discretion. The Controlled Substances Act vests district courts with jurisdiction to enjoin violations of the Act, 21 U.S.C.  882(a). But a \"grant of jurisdiction to issue [equitable relief] hardly suggests an absolute duty to do so under any and all circumstances,\" Hecht, supra, at 329 (emphasis omitted). Because the District Court's use of equitable power is not textually required by any \"clear and valid legislative command,\" the court did not have to issue an injunction.~    ~    ~      23~      TVA v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153 (1978), does not support the Government's contention that the District Court lacked discretion in fashioning injunctive relief. In Hill, the Court held that the Endangered Species Act of 1973 required the District Court to enjoin completion of a dam, whose operation would either eradicate the known population of the snail darter or destroy its critical habitat. Id., at 193-195. The District Court lacked discretion because an injunction was the \"only means of ensuring compliance.\" Romero-Barcelo, supra, at 314 (explaining why the District Court in Hill lacked discretion). Congress' \"order of priorities,\" as expressed in the statute, would be deprived of effect if the District Court could choose to deny injunctive relief. Hill, supra, at 194. In effect, the District Court had only a Hobson's choice. By contrast, with respect to the Controlled Substances Act, criminal enforcement is an alternative, and indeed the customary, means of ensuring compliance with the statute. Congress' resolution of the policy issues can be (and usually is) upheld without an injunction.~    ~    B~    ~      24~      But the mere fact that the District Court had discretion does not suggest that the District Court, when evaluating the motion to modify the injunction, could consider any and all factors that might relate to the public interest or the conveniences of the parties, including the medical needs of the Cooperative's patients. On the contrary, a court sitting in equity cannot \"ignore the judgment of Congress, deliberately expressed in legislation.\" Virginian R. Co. v. Railway Employees, 300 U.S. 515, 551 (1937). A district court cannot, for example, override Congress' policy choice, articulated in a statute, as to what behavior should be prohibited. \"Once Congress, exercising its delegated powers, has decided the order of priorities in a given area, it is ... for the courts to enforce them when enforcement is sought.\" Hill, 437 U.S., at 194. Courts of equity cannot, in their discretion, reject the balance that Congress has struck in a statute. Id., at 194-195. Their choice (unless there is statutory language to the contrary) is simply whether a particular means of enforcing the statute should be chosen over another permissible means; their choice is not whether enforcement is preferable to no enforcement at all.9 Consequently, when a court of equity exercises its discretion, it may not consider the advantages and disadvantages of nonenforcement of the statute, but only the advantages and disadvantages of \"employing the extraordinary remedy of injunction,\" Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S., at 311, over the other available methods of enforcement. Cf. id., at 316 (referring to \"discretion to rely on remedies other than an immediate prohibitory injunction\") To the extent the district court considers the public interest and the conveniences of the parties, the court is limited to evaluating how such interest and conveniences are affected by the selection of an injunction over other enforcement mechanisms.~    ~    C~    ~      25~      In this case, the Court of Appeals erred by considering relevant the evidence that some people have \"serious medical conditions for whom the use of cannabis is necessary in order to treat or alleviate those conditions or their symptoms,\" that these people \"will suffer serious harm if they are denied cannabis,\" and that \"there is no legal alternative to cannabis for the effective treatment of their medical conditions.\" 190 F.3d, at 1115. As explained above, in the Controlled Substances Act, the balance already has been struck against a medical necessity exception. Because the statutory prohibitions cover even those who have what could be termed a medical necessity, the Act precludes consideration of this evidence. It was thus error for the Court of Appeals to instruct the District Court on remand to consider \"the criteria for a medical necessity exemption, and, should it modify the injunction, to set forth those criteria in the modification order.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      26~      * * *~    ~    ~      27~      The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      28~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      29~      Justice Breyer took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.~    ~    ~      30~      Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg join, concurring in the judgment.~    ~    ~      31~      nllfotNotes:~    ~    ~      ~        1~         The Government requested, and the District Court granted, an injunction that prohibited the possession of marijuana with the intent to manufacture and distribute, as well as the distribution and manufacture of marijuana. For simplicity, in this opinion, we refer to these activities collectively as distributing and manufacturing marijuana. The legal issues are the same for all of these activities.~      ~      ~        2~         The amended preliminary injunction reaffirmed that the Cooperative is generally enjoined from manufacturing, distributing, and possessing with the intent to manufacture or distribute marijuana, but it carved out an exception for cases of medical necessity. Specifically, the District Court ordered that \"[t]he foregoing injunction does not apply to the distribution of cannabis by [the Cooperative] to patient-members who (1) suffer from a serious medical condition, (2) will suffer imminent harm if the patient-member does not have access to cannabis, (3) need cannabis for the treatment of the patient-member's medical condition, or need cannabis to alleviate the medical condition or symptoms associated with the medical condition, and (4) have no reasonable legal alternative to cannabis for the effective treatment or alleviation of the patient-member's medical condition or symptoms associated with the medical condition because the patient-member has tried all other legal alternatives to cannabis and the alternatives have been ineffective in treating or alleviating the patient-member's medical condition or symptoms associated with the medical condition, or the alternatives result in side effects which the patient-member cannot reasonably tolerate.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a-17a.   The United States appealed the District Court's order amending the preliminary injunction. At the Government's request, we stayed the order pending the appeal. 530 U.S. 1298 (2000). The Court of Appeals has postponed oral argument pending our decision in this case.~      ~      ~        3~         The Cooperative is incorrect to suggest that Bailey has settled the question whether federal courts have authority to recognize a necessity defense not provided by statute. There, the Court rejected the necessity defense of a prisoner who contended that adverse prison conditions justified his prison escape. The Court held that the necessity defense is unavailable to prisoners, like Bailey, who fail to present evidence of a bona fide effort to surrender as soon as the claimed necessity had lost its coercive force. 444 U.S., at 415. It was not argued, and so there was no occasion to consider, whether the statute might be unable to bear any necessity defense at all. And although the Court noted that Congress \"legislates against a background of Anglo-Saxon common law\" and thus \"may\" have contemplated a necessity defense, the Court refused to \"balanc[e] [the] harms,\" explaining that \"we are construing an Act of Congress, not drafting it.\" Id., at 415, n. 11.~      ~      ~        4~         We reject the Cooperative's intimation that elimination of the defense requires an \"explici[t]\" statement. Brief for Respondents 21. Considering that we have never held necessity to be a viable justification for violating a federal statute, see supra, at 5-6, and n. 3, and that such a defense would entail a social balancing that is better left to Congress, we decline to set the bar so high.~      ~      ~        5~         As noted, supra, at 5, the only express exception for schedule I drugs is the Government-approved research project, see 21 U.S.C.  823(f). Unlike drugs in other schedules, see 829, schedule I drugs cannot be dispensed under a prescription.~      ~      ~        6~         The Government argues that the 1998 \"sense of the Congress\" resolution, 112 Stat. 2681-760 to 2681-761, supports its position that Congress has foreclosed the medical necessity defense. Entitled \"Not Legalizing Marijuana for Medicinal Use,\" the resolution declares that \"Congress continues to support the existing Federal legal process for determining the safety and efficacy of drugs and opposes efforts to circumvent this process by legalizing marijuana, and other Schedule I drugs, for medicinal use without valid scientific evidence and the approval of the Food and Drug Administration.\" Because we conclude that the Controlled Substances Act cannot sustain the medical necessity defense, we need not consider whether the 1998 \"sense of the Congress resolution\" is additional evidence of a legislative determination to eliminate the defense.~      ~      ~        7~         Lest there be any confusion, we clarify that nothing in our analysis, or the statute, suggests that a distinction should be drawn between the prohibitions on manufacturing and distributing and the other prohibitions in the Controlled Substances Act. Furthermore, the very point of our holding is that there is no medical necessity exception to the prohibitions at issue, even when the patient is \"seriously ill\" and lacks alternative avenues for relief. Indeed, it is the Cooperative's argument that its patients are \"seriously ill,\" see, e.g., Brief for Respondents 11, 13, 17, and lacking \"alternatives,\" see, e.g., id., at 13. We reject the argument that these factors warrant a medical necessity exception. If we did not, we would be affirming instead of reversing the Court of Appeals.~        Finally, we share Justice Stevens' concern for \"showing respect for the sovereign States that comprise our Federal Union.\" Post, at 3 (opinion concurring in judgment). However, we are \"construing an Act of Congress, not drafting it.\" United States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394, 415, n. 11 (1980). Because federal courts interpret, rather than author, the federal criminal code, we are not at liberty to rewrite it. Nor are we passing today on a constitutional question, such as whether the Controlled Substances Act exceeds Congress' power under the Commerce Clause.~      ~      ~        8~         Notwithstanding Justice Stevens' concerns, post, at 4, it is appropriate for us to address this issue because this case arises from a motion to modify the injunction, because the Court of Appeals held that the District Court misconstrued its equitable discretion, and because the Cooperative offers this conclusion as an alternative ground for affirmance.~      ~      ~        9~         Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321 (1944), for example, held that the District Court was not required to issue an injunction to restrain violations of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 and regulations thereunder when \"some 'other order' might be more appropriate, or at least so appear to the court.\" Id., at 328 (quoting statutory provision that enabled district court to issue an injunction, a restraining order, \"or other order\"). Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305 (1982), held that a District Court had discretion not to issue an injunction precluding the United States Navy from releasing ordnance into water, but to rely on other means of ensuring compliance, including ordering the Navy to obtain a permit. Id., at 314-318. See also Amoco Production Co. v. Gambell, 480 U.S. 531, 544-546 (1987) (holding that a District Court did not err in declining to issue an injunction to bar exploratory drilling on Alaskan public lands, because the district court's decision \"did not undermine\" the policy of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C.  3120 and because the Secretary of the Interior had other means of meaningfully complying with the statute).~      ~    ~    Stevens, J., concurring in judgment~    ~      32~      Lest the Court's narrow holding be lost in its broad dicta, let me restate it here: \"[W]e hold that medical necessity is not a defense to manufacturing and distributing marijuana.\" Ante, at 10 (emphasis added). This confined holding is consistent with our grant of certiorari, which was limited to the question \"[w]hether the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. 801 et seq., forecloses a medical necessity defense to the Act's prohibition against manufacturing and distributing marijuana, a Schedule I controlled substance.\" Pet. for Cert. (I) (emphasis added). And, at least with respect to distribution, this holding is consistent with how the issue was raised and litigated below. As stated by the District Court, the question before it was \"whether [respondents'] admitted distribution of marijuana for use by seriously ill persons upon a physician's recommendation violates federal law,\" and if so, whether such distribution \"should be enjoined pursuant to the injunctive relief provisions of the federal Controlled Substances Act.\" United States v. Cannabis Cultivators Club, 5 F. Supp. 2d 1086, 1091 (ND Cal. 1998) (emphasis added).~    ~    ~      33~      Accordingly, in the lower courts as well as here, respondents have raised the medical necessity defense as a justification for distributing marijuana to cooperative members, and it was in that context that the Ninth Circuit determined that respondents had \"a legally cognizable defense.\" 190 F.3d 1109, 1114 (1999). The Court is surely correct to reverse that determination. Congress' classification of marijuana as a schedule I controlled substance-that is, one that cannot be distributed outside of approved research projects, see 21 U.S.C.  812 823(f), 829-makes it clear that \"the Controlled Substances Act cannot bear a medical necessity defense to distributions of marijuana,\" ante, at 10 (emphasis added)).1~    ~    ~      34~      Apart from its limited holding, the Court takes two unwarranted and unfortunate excursions that prevent me from joining its opinion. First, the Court reaches beyond its holding, and beyond the facts of the case, by suggesting that the defense of necessity is unavailable for anyone under the Controlled Substances Act. Ante, at 6-9, 10, n. 7, 15. Because necessity was raised in this case as a defense to distribution, the Court need not venture an opinion on whether the defense is available to anyone other than distributors. Most notably, whether the defense might be available to a seriously ill patient for whom there is no alternative means of avoiding starvation or extraordinary suffering is a difficult issue that is not presented here.2~    ~    ~      35~      Second, the Court gratuitously casts doubt on \"whether necessity can ever be a defense\" to any federal statute that does not explicitly provide for it, calling such a defense into question by a misleading reference to its existence as an \"open question.\" Ante, at 5, 6. By contrast, our precedent has expressed no doubt about the viability of the common-law defense, even in the context of federal criminal statutes that do not provide for it in so many words. See, e.g., United States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394, 415 (1980) (\"We therefore hold that, where a criminal defendant is charged with escape and claims that he is entitled to an instruction on the theory of duress or necessity, he must proffer evidence of a bona fide effort to surrender or return to custody as soon as the claimed duress or necessity had lost its coercive force\"); id., at 415, n. 11 (\"Our principal difference with the dissent, therefore, is not as to the existence of such a defense but as to the importance of surrender as an element of it\" (emphasis added)). Indeed, the Court's comment on the general availability of the necessity defense is completely unnecessary because the Government has made no such suggestion. Cf. Brief for Petitioner 17-18 (narrowly arguing that necessity defense cannot succeed if legislature has already \"canvassed the issue\" and precluded it for a particular statute (internal quotation marks omitted)). The Court's opinion on this point is pure dictum.~    ~    ~      36~      The overbroad language of the Court's opinion is especially unfortunate given the importance of showing respect for the sovereign States that comprise our Federal Union. That respect imposes a duty on federal courts, whenever possible, to avoid or minimize conflict between federal and state law, particularly in situations in which the citizens of a State have chosen to \"serve as a laboratory\" in the trial of \"novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.\" New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U.S. 262, 311 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). In my view, this is such a case.(FN3( By passing Proposition 215, California voters have decided that seriously ill patients and their primary caregivers should be exempt from prosecution under state laws for cultivating and possessing marijuana if the patient's physician recommends using the drug for treatment.4 This case does not call upon the Court to deprive all such patients of the benefit of the necessity defense to federal prosecution, when the case itself does not involve any such patients.~    ~    ~      37~      An additional point deserves emphasis. This case does not require us to rule on the scope of the District Court's discretion to enjoin, or to refuse to enjoin, the possession of marijuana or other potential violations of the Controlled Substances Act by a seriously ill patient for whom the drug may be a necessity. Whether it would be an abuse of discretion for the District Court to refuse to enjoin those sorts of violations, and whether the District Court may consider the availability of the necessity defense for that sort of violator, are questions that should be decided on the authority of cases such as Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321 (1944), and Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305 (1982), and that properly should be left \"open\" by this case.~    ~    ~      38~      I join the Court's judgment of reversal because I agree that a distributor of marijuana does not have a medical necessity defense under the Controlled Substances Act. I do not, however, join the dicta in the Court's opinion.~    ~    ~      ~        Notes:~      ~      ~        1~         In any event, respondents do not fit the paradigm of a defendant who may assert necessity. The defense \"traditionally covered the situation where physical forces beyond the actor's control rendered illegal conduct the lesser of two evils.\" United States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394, 410 (1980); see generally 1 W. LaFave  A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law 5.4, pp. 627-640 (1986). Respondents, on the other hand, have not been forced to confront a choice of evils-violating federal law by distributing marijuana to seriously ill patients or letting those individuals suffer-but have thrust that choice upon themselves by electing to become distributors for such patients. Of course, respondents also cannot claim necessity based upon the choice of evils facing seriously ill patients, as that is not the same choice respondents face.~      ~      ~        2~         As a result, perhaps the most glaring example of the Court's dicta is its footnote 7, where it opines that \"nothing in our analysis, or the statute, suggests that a distinction should be drawn between the prohibitions on manufacturing and distributing and the other prohibitions in the Controlled Substances Act.\" Ante, at 10, n. 7.~      ~      ~        3~         Cf.

After the parties accepted a nonbinding arbitration proposal  generally favorable to the teachers, respondent Vopper, a radio commentator,  played a tape of the intercepted conversation on his public affairs talk show in  connection with news reports about the settlement. Petitioners filed this  damages suit under both federal and state wiretapping laws, alleging, among  other things, that their conversation had been surreptitiously intercepted by an  unknown person; that respondent Yocum, the head of a local organization opposed  to the union's demands, had obtained the tape and intentionally disclosed it to,  inter alios, media representatives; and that they had repeatedly published the  conversation even though they knew or had reason to know that it had been  illegally intercepted. In ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment, the  District Court concluded that, under the statutory language, an individual  violates the federal Act by intentionally disclosing the contents of an  electronic communication when he or she knows or has reason to know that the  information was obtained through an illegal interception, even if the individual  was not involved in that interception; found that the question whether the  interception was intentional raised a genuine issue of material fact; and  rejected respondents' defense that they were protected by the First Amendment  even if the disclosures violated the statutes, finding that the statutes were content-neutral laws of general applicability containing no indicia of prior  restraint or the chilling of free speech. The Third Circuit accepted an  interlocutory appeal, and the United States, also a petitioner, intervened to  defend the federal Act's constitutionality. Applying intermediate scrutiny, the  court found the statutes invalid because they deterred significantly more speech  than necessary to protect the private interests at stake, and remanded the case  with instructions to enter summary judgment for respondents.~    ~    ~      1~      Held: The First Amendment protects the disclosures made by respondents in this  suit. Pp. 6-20.~    ~    ~      2~      (a) Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, as  amended, generally prohibits the interception of wire, electronic, and oral  communications. Title 18 U.S.C.  2511(1)(a) applies to the person who willfully  intercepts such communications and subsection (c) to any person who, knowing or  having reason to know that the communication was obtained through an illegal  interception, willfully discloses its contents. Pp. 6-9.~    ~    ~      3~      (b) Because of this suit's procedural posture, the Court accepts that the  interception was unlawful and that respondents had reason to know that.  Accordingly, the disclosures violated the statutes. In answering the remaining  question whether the statutes' application in such circumstances violates the  First Amendment, the Court accepts respondents' submissions that they played no  part in the illegal interception, that their access to the information was  obtained lawfully, and that the conversations dealt with a matter of public  concern. Pp. 9-10.~    ~    ~      4~      (c) Section 2511(1)(c) is a content-neutral law of general applicability.  The statute's purpose is to protect the privacy of wire, electronic, and oral  communications, and it singles out such communications by virtue of the fact  that they were illegally intercepted-by virtue of the source rather than the  subject matter. Cf. Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791. On the other  hand, the prohibition against disclosures is fairly characterized as a  regulation of speech. Pp. 10-12.~    ~    ~      5~      (d) In New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713, this Court upheld  the press' right to publish information of great public concern obtained from  documents stolen by a third party. In so doing, this Court focused on the stolen  documents' character and the consequences of public disclosure, not on the fact  that the documents were stolen. Ibid. It also left open the question whether, in  cases where information has been acquired unlawfully by a newspaper or by a  source, government may punish not only the unlawful acquisition, but also the  ensuing publication. Florida Star v. B. J. F., 491 U.S. 524, 535, n. 8. The  issue here is a narrower version of that question: Where the publisher has  lawfully obtained information from a source who obtained it unlawfully, may the  government punish the ensuing publication based on the defect in a chain? The  Court's refusal to construe the issue more broadly is consistent with its  repeated refusal to answer categorically whether the publication of truthful  information may ever be punished consistent with the First Amendment.  Accordingly, the Court considers whether, given the facts here, the interests  served by 2511(1)(c) justify its restrictions on speech. Pp. 12-14.~    ~    ~      6~      (e) The first interest identified by the Government-removing an incentive  for parties to intercept private conversations-does not justify applying  2511(1)(c) to an otherwise innocent disclosure of public information. The  normal method of deterring unlawful conduct is to punish the person engaging in  it. It would be remarkable to hold that speech by a law-abiding possessor of  information can be suppressed in order to deter conduct by a non-law-abiding  third party. In virtually all 2511(1)(a), (c), or (d) violations, the  interceptor's identity has been known. There is no evidence that Congress  thought that the prohibition against disclosures would deter illegal  interceptions, and no evidence to support the assumption that the prohibition  reduces the number of such interceptions. Pp. 14-16.~    ~    ~      7~      (f) The Government's second interest-minimizing the harm to persons whose  conversations have been illegally intercepted-is considerably stronger. Privacy  of communication is an important interest. However, in this suit, privacy  concerns give way when balanced against the interest in publishing matters of  public importance. One of the costs associated with participation in public  affairs is an attendant loss of privacy. The profound national commitment to the  principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide  open supported this Court's holding in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S.  254, that neither factual error nor defamatory content, nor a combination of the  two, sufficed to remove the First Amendment shield from criticism of official  conduct. Parallel reasoning requires the conclusion that a stranger's illegal  conduct does not suffice to remove the First Amendment shield from speech about  a matter of public concern. Pp. 16-20.~    ~    ~      8~      200 F.3d 109, affirmed.~    ~    ~      9~      ON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD  CIRCUIT~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        *~          Together with No. 99-1728, United States v. Vopper, aka Williams, et al.,  also on certiorari to the same court.~      ~    ~    ~      10~      Stevens, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which O'Connor, Kennedy, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.~    ~    Opinion of the Court~    ~      11~      Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      12~      These cases raise an important question concerning what degree of protection, if any, the First Amendment provides to speech that discloses the  contents of an illegally intercepted communication. That question is both novel  and narrow. Despite the fact that federal law has prohibited such disclosures  since 1934,1 this is the first time that we have confronted such an issue.~    ~    ~      13~      The suit at hand involves the repeated intentional disclosure of an illegally intercepted cellular telephone conversation about a public issue. The  persons who made the disclosures did not participate in the interception, but  they did know-or at least had reason to know-that the interception was unlawful.  Accordingly, these cases present a conflict between interests of the highest  order-on the one hand, the interest in the full and free dissemination of  information concerning public issues, and, on the other hand, the interest in  individual privacy and, more specifically, in fostering private speech. The  Framers of the First Amendment surely did not foresee the advances in science  that produced the conversation, the interception, or the conflict that gave rise  to this action. It is therefore not surprising that Circuit judges, as well as  the Members of this Court, have come to differing conclusions about the First  Amendment's application to this issue. Nevertheless, having considered the  interests at stake, we are firmly convinced that the disclosures made by  respondents in this suit are protected by the First Amendment.~    ~    ~      14~      * During 1992 and most of 1993, the Pennsylvania State Education Association, a union representing the teachers at the Wyoming Valley West High School,  engaged in collective-bargaining negotiations with the school board. Petitioner  Kane, then the president of the local union, testified that the negotiations  were \" 'contentious' \" and received \"a lot of media attention.\" App. 97, 92. In  May 1993, petitioner Bartnicki, who was acting as the union's \"chief  negotiator,\" used the cellular phone in her car to call Kane and engage in a  lengthy conversation about the status of the negotiations. An unidentified  person intercepted and recorded that call.~    ~    ~      15~      In their conversation, Kane and Bartnicki discussed the timing of a proposed strike, id., at 41-45, difficulties created by public comment on the  negotiations, id., at 46, and the need for a dramatic response to the board's  intransigence. At one point, Kane said: \" 'If they're not gonna move for three  percent, we're gonna have to go to their, their homes . . . To blow off their  front porches, we'll have to do some work on some of those guys. (PAUSES).  Really, uh, really and truthfully because this is, you know, this is bad news.  (UNDECIPHERABLE).' \" Ibid.~    ~    ~      16~      In the early fall of 1993, the parties accepted a non-binding arbitration proposal that was generally favorable to the teachers. In connection with news  reports about the settlement, respondent Vopper, a radio commentator who had  been critical of the union in the past, played a tape of the intercepted  conversation on his public affairs talk show. Another station also broadcast the  tape, and local newspapers published its contents. After filing suit against  Vopper and other representatives of the media, Bartnicki and Kane (hereinafter  petitioners) learned through discovery that Vopper had obtained the tape from  Jack Yocum, the head of a local taxpayers' organization that had opposed the  union's demands throughout the negotiations. Yocum, who was added as a  defendant, testified that he had found the tape in his mailbox shortly after the  interception and recognized the voices of Bartnicki and Kane. Yocum played the  tape for some members of the school board, and later delivered the tape itself  to Vopper.~    ~    II~    ~      17~      In their amended complaint, petitioners alleged that their telephone conversation had been surreptitiously intercepted by an unknown person using an  electronic device, that Yocum had obtained a tape of that conversation, and that  he intentionally disclosed it to Vopper, as well as other individuals and media  representatives. Thereafter, Vopper and other members of the media repeatedly  published the contents of that conversation. The amended complaint alleged that  each of the defendants \"knew or had reason to know\" that the recording of the  private telephone conversation had been obtained by means of an illegal  interception. Relying on both federal and Pennsylvania statutory provisions,  petitioners sought actual damages, statutory damages, punitive damages, and  attorney's fees and costs.2~    ~    ~      18~      After the parties completed their discovery, they filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Respondents contended that they had not violated the statute  because (a) they had nothing to do with the interception, and (b) in any event,  their actions were not unlawful since the conversation might have been  intercepted inadvertently. Moreover, even if they had violated the statute by  disclosing the intercepted conversation, respondents argued, those disclosures  were protected by the First Amendment. The District Court rejected the first  statutory argument because, under the plain statutory language, an individual  violates the federal Act by intentionally disclosing the contents of an  electronic communication when he or she \"know[s] or ha[s] reason to know that  the information was obtained\" through an illegal interception.3 App. to Pet. for  Cert. in No. 99-1687, pp. 53a-54a. Accordingly, actual involvement in the  illegal interception is not necessary in order to establish a violation of that  statute. With respect to the second statutory argument, the District Court  agreed that petitioners had to prove that the interception in question was  intentional,4 but concluded that the text of the interception raised a genuine  issue of material fact with respect to intent. That issue of fact was also the  basis for the District Court's denial of petitioners' motion. Finally, the  District Court rejected respondents' First Amendment defense because the  statutes were content-neutral laws of general applicability that contained \"no  indicia of prior restraint or the chilling of free speech.\" Id., at 55a-56a.~    ~    ~      19~      Thereafter, the District Court granted a motion for an interlocutory appeal, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1292(b). It certified as controlling questions of law:  \"(1) whether the imposition of liability on the media Defendants under the  [wiretapping statutes] solely for broadcasting the newsworthy tape on the  Defendant [Vopper's] radio/public affairs program, when the tape was illegally  intercepted and recorded by unknown persons who were not agents of [the]  Defendants, violates the First Amendment; and (2) whether imposition of  liability under the aforesaid [wiretapping] statutes on Defendant Jack Yocum  solely for providing the anonymously intercepted and recorded tape to the media  Defendants violates the First Amendment.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 99-1728,  p. 76a. The Court of Appeals accepted the appeal, and the United States, also a  petitioner, intervened pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  2403 in order to defend the  constitutionality of the federal statute.~    ~    ~      20~      All three members of the panel agreed with petitioners and the Government that the federal and Pennsylvania wiretapping statutes are \"content neutral\" and  therefore subject to \"intermediate scrutiny.\" 200 F.3d 109, 121 (CA3 1999).  Applying that standard, the majority concluded that the statutes were invalid  because they deterred significantly more speech than necessary to protect the  privacy interests at stake. The court remanded the case with instructions to  enter summary judgment for respondents. In dissent, Senior Judge Pollak  expressed the view that the prohibition against disclosures was necessary in  order to remove the incentive for illegal interceptions and to preclude  compounding the harm caused by such interceptions through wider dissemination.  In so doing, he agreed with the majority opinion in a similar case decided by  the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Boehner v. McDermott, 191  F.3d 463 (1999). See also Peavy v. WFAA-TV, Inc., 221 F.3d 158 (CA5 2000).5 We  granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. 530 U.S. 1260 (2000).~    ~    III~    ~      21~      As we pointed out in Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41, 45-49 (1967), sophisticated (and not so sophisticated) methods of eavesdropping on oral  conversations and intercepting telephone calls have been practiced for decades,  primarily by law enforcement authorities.6 In Berger, we held that New York's  broadly written statute authorizing the police to conduct wiretaps violated the  Fourth Amendment. Largely in response to that decision, and to our holding in  Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967), that the attachment of a listening  and recording device to the outside of a telephone booth constituted a search,  \"Congress undertook to draft comprehensive legislation both authorizing the use  of evidence obtained by electronic surveillance on specified conditions, and  prohibiting its use otherwise. S. Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 66  (1968).\" Gelbard v. United States, 408 U.S. 41, 78 (1972) (Rehnquist, J.,  dissenting). The ultimate result of those efforts was Title III of the Omnibus  Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 82 Stat. 211, entitled Wiretapping  and Electronic Surveillance.~    ~    ~      22~      One of the stated purposes of that title was \"to protect effectively the privacy of wire and oral communications.\" Ibid. In addition to authorizing and  regulating electronic surveillance for law enforcement purposes, Title III also  regulated private conduct. One part of those regulations, 2511(1), defined five  offenses punishable by a fine of not more than $10,000, by imprisonment for not  more than five years, or by both. Subsection (a) applied to any person who  \"willfully intercepts . . . any wire or oral communication.\" Subsection (b)  applied to the intentional use of devices designed to intercept oral  conversations; subsection (d) applied to the use of the contents of illegally  intercepted wire or oral communications; and subsection (e) prohibited the  unauthorized disclosure of the contents of interceptions that were authorized  for law enforcement purposes. Subsection (c), the original version of the  provision most directly at issue in this case, applied to any person who  \"willfully discloses, or endeavors to disclose, to any other person the contents  of any wire or oral communication, knowing or having reason to know that the  information was obtained through the interception of a wire or oral  communication in violation of this subsection.\" The oral communications  protected by the Act were only those \"uttered by a person exhibiting an  expectation that such communication is not subject to interception under  circumstances justifying such expectation.\" 18 U.S.C.  2510(2).~    ~    ~      23~      As enacted in 1968, Title III did not apply to the monitoring of radio transmissions. In the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, 100 Stat.  1848, however, Congress enlarged the coverage of Title III to prohibit the  interception of \"electronic\" as well as oral and wire communications. By reason  of that amendment, as well as a 1994 amendment which applied to cordless  telephone communications, 108 Stat. 4279, Title III now applies to the  interception of conversations over both cellular and cordless phones.7 Although  a lesser criminal penalty may apply to the interception of such transmissions,  the same civil remedies are available whether the communication was \"oral,\"  \"wire,\" or \"electronic,\" as defined by 18 U.S.C.  2510 (1994 ed. and Supp. V).~    ~    IV~    ~      24~      The constitutional question before us concerns the validity of the statutes as applied to the specific facts of this case. Because of the procedural posture  of the case, it is appropriate to make certain important assumptions about those  facts. We accept petitioners' submission that the interception was intentional,  and therefore unlawful, and that, at a minimum, respondents \"had reason to know\"  that it was unlawful. Accordingly, the disclosure of the contents of the  intercepted conversation by Yocum to school board members and to representatives  of the media, as well as the subsequent disclosures by the media defendants to  the public, violated the federal and state statutes. Under the provisions of the  federal statute, as well as its Pennsylvania analog, petitioners are thus  entitled to recover damages from each of the respondents. The only question is  whether the application of these statutes in such circumstances violates the  First Amendment.8~    ~    ~      25~      In answering that question, we accept respondents' submission on three factual matters that serve to distinguish most of the cases that have arisen  under 2511. First, respondents played no part in the illegal interception.  Rather, they found out about the interception only after it occurred, and in  fact never learned the identity of the person or persons who made the  interception. Second, their access to the information on the tapes was obtained  lawfully, even though the information itself was intercepted unlawfully by  someone else. Cf. Florida Star v. B. J. F., 491 U.S. 524, 536 (1989) (\"Even  assuming the Constitution permitted a State to proscribe receipt of information,  Florida has not taken this step\"). Third, the subject matter of the conversation  was a matter of public concern. If the statements about the labor negotiations  had been made in a public arena-during a bargaining session, for example-they  would have been newsworthy. This would also be true if a third party had  inadvertently overheard Bartnicki making the same statements to Kane when the  two thought they were alone.~    ~    V~    ~      26~      We agree with petitioners that 2511(1)(c), as well as its Pennsylvania analog, is in fact a content-neutral law of general applicability. \"Deciding  whether a particular regulation is content based or content neutral is not  always a simple task. . . . As a general rule, laws that by their terms  distinguish favored speech from disfavored speech on the basis of the ideas or  views expressed are content based.\" Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512  U.S. 622, 642-643 (1994). In determining whether a regulation is content based  or content neutral, we look to the purpose behind the regulation; typically,  \"[g]overnment regulation of expressive activity is content neutral so long as it  is 'justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.' \" Ward  v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989).9~    ~    ~      27~      In this case, the basic purpose of the statute at issue is to \"protec[t] the privacy of wire[, electronic,] and oral communications.\" S. Rep. No. 1097, 90th  Cong., 2d Sess., 66 (1968). The statute does not distinguish based on the  content of the intercepted conversations, nor is it justified by reference to  the content of those conversations. Rather, the communications at issue are  singled out by virtue of the fact that they were illegally intercepted-by virtue  of the source, rather than the subject matter.~    ~    ~      28~      On the other hand, the naked prohibition against disclosures is fairly characterized as a regulation of pure speech. Unlike the prohibition against the  \"use\" of the contents of an illegal interception in 2511(1)(d),10 subsection  (c) is not a regulation of conduct. It is true that the delivery of a tape  recording might be regarded as conduct, but given that the purpose of such a  delivery is to provide the recipient with the text of recorded statements, it is  like the delivery of a handbill or a pamphlet, and as such, it is the kind of  \"speech\" that the First Amendment protects.11 As the majority below put it,  \"[i]f the acts of 'disclosing' and 'publishing' information do not constitute  speech, it is hard to imagine what does fall within that category, as distinct  from the category of expressive conduct.\" 200 F.3d, at 120.~    ~    VI~    ~      29~      As a general matter, \"state action to punish the publication of truthful information seldom can satisfy constitutional standards.\" Smith v. Daily Mail  Publishing Co., 443 U.S. 97, 102 (1979). More specifically, this Court has  repeatedly held that \"if a newspaper lawfully obtains truthful information about  a matter of public significance then state officials may not constitutionally  punish publication of the information, absent a need . . . of the highest  order.\" Id., at 103; see also Florida Star v. B. J. F., 491 U.S. 524 (1989);  Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U.S. 829 (1978).~    ~    ~      30~      Accordingly, in New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971) (per curiam), the Court upheld the right of the press to publish information of  great public concern obtained from documents stolen by a third party. In so  doing, that decision resolved a conflict between the basic rule against prior  restraints on publication and the interest in preserving the secrecy of  information that, if disclosed, might seriously impair the security of the  Nation. In resolving that conflict, the attention of every Member of this Court  was focused on the character of the stolen documents' contents and the  consequences of public disclosure. Although the undisputed fact that the  newspaper intended to publish information obtained from stolen documents was  noted in Justice Harlan's dissent, id., at 754, neither the majority nor the  dissenters placed any weight on that fact.~    ~    ~      31~      However, New York Times v. United States raised, but did not resolve the question \"whether, in cases where information has been acquired unlawfully by a  newspaper or by a source, government may ever punish not only the unlawful  acquisition, but the ensuing publication as well.\"12 Florida Star, 491 U.S., at  535, n. 8. The question here, however, is a narrower version of that still-open  question. Simply put, the issue here is this: \"Where the punished publisher of  information has obtained the information in question in a manner lawful in  itself but from a source who has obtained it unlawfully, may the government  punish the ensuing publication of that information based on the defect in a  chain?\" Boehner, 191 F.3d, at 484-485 (Sentelle, J., dissenting).~    ~    ~      32~      Our refusal to construe the issue presented more broadly is consistent with this Court's repeated refusal to answer categorically whether truthful  publication may ever be punished consistent with the First Amendment. Rather,  \"[o]ur cases have carefully eschewed reaching this ultimate question, mindful  that the future may bring scenarios which prudence counsels our not resolving  anticipatorily. . . . We continue to believe that the sensitivity and  significance of the interests presented in clashes between [the] First Amendment  and privacy rights counsel relying on limited principles that sweep no more  broadly than the appropriate context of the instant case.\" Florida Star, 491  U.S., at 532-533.~    ~    ~      33~      See also Landmark Communications, 435 U.S., at 838. Accordingly, we consider whether, given the facts of this case, the interests served by 2511(1)(c) can  justify its restrictions on speech.~    ~    ~      34~      The Government identifies two interests served by the statute-first, the interest in removing an incentive for parties to intercept private  conversations, and second, the interest in minimizing the harm to persons whose  conversations have been illegally intercepted. We assume that those interests  adequately justify the prohibition in 2511(1)(d) against the interceptor's own  use of information that he or she acquired by violating 2511(1)(a), but it by  no means follows that punishing disclosures of lawfully obtained information of  public interest by one not involved in the initial illegality is an acceptable  means of serving those ends.~    ~    ~      35~      The normal method of deterring unlawful conduct is to impose an appropriate punishment on the person who engages in it. If the sanctions that presently  attach to a violation of 2511(1)(a) do not provide sufficient deterrence,  perhaps those sanctions should be made more severe. But it would be quite  remarkable to hold that speech by a law-abiding possessor of information can be  suppressed in order to deter conduct by a non-law-abiding third party. Although  there are some rare occasions in which a law suppressing one party's speech may  be justified by an interest in deterring criminal conduct by another, see, e.g.,  New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982),13 this is not such a case.~    ~    ~      36~      With only a handful of exceptions, the violations of 2511(1)(a) that have been described in litigated cases have been motivated by either financial gain  or domestic disputes.14 In virtually all of those cases, the identity of the  person or persons intercepting the communication has been known.15 Moreover,  petitioners cite no evidence that Congress viewed the prohibition against  disclosures as a response to the difficulty of identifying persons making  improper use of scanners and other surveillance devices and accordingly of  deterring such conduct,16 and there is no empirical evidence to support the  assumption that the prohibition against disclosures reduces the number of  illegal interceptions.17~    ~    ~      37~      Although this case demonstrates that there may be an occasional situation in which an anonymous scanner will risk criminal prosecution by passing on  information without any expectation of financial reward or public praise, surely  this is the exceptional case. Moreover, there is no basis for assuming that  imposing sanctions upon respondents will deter the unidentified scanner from  continuing to engage in surreptitious interceptions. Unusual cases fall far  short of a showing that there is a \"need of the highest order\" for a rule  supplementing the traditional means of deterring antisocial conduct. The  justification for any such novel burden on expression must be \"far stronger than  mere speculation about serious harms.\" United States v. Treasury Employees, 513  U.S. 454, 475 (1995).18 Accordingly, the Government's first suggested  justification for applying 2511(1)(c) to an otherwise innocent disclosure of public information is plainly insufficient.19~    ~    ~      38~      The Government's second argument, however, is considerably stronger. Privacy of communication is an important interest, Harper  Row, Publishers, Inc. v.  Nation Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539, 559 (1985),20 and Title III's restrictions are  intended to protect that interest, thereby \"encouraging the uninhibited exchange  of ideas and information among private parties . . . .\" Brief for United States  27. Moreover, the fear of public disclosure of private conversations might well  have a chilling effect on private speech.~    ~    ~      39~      \"In a democratic society privacy of communication is essential if citizens are to think and act creatively and constructively. Fear or suspicion that one's  speech is being monitored by a stranger, even without the reality of such  activity, can have a seriously inhibiting effect upon the willingness to voice  critical and constructive ideas.\" President's Commission on Law Enforcement and  Administration of Justice, The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society 202 (1967).  Accordingly, it seems to us that there are important interests to be considered  on both sides of the constitutional calculus. In considering that balance, we  acknowledge that some intrusions on privacy are more offensive than others, and  that the disclosure of the contents of a private conversation can be an even  greater intrusion on privacy than the interception itself. As a result, there is  a valid independent justification for prohibiting such disclosures by persons  who lawfully obtained access to the contents of an illegally intercepted  message, even if that prohibition does not play a significant role in preventing  such interceptions from occurring in the first place.~    ~    ~      40~      We need not decide whether that interest is strong enough to justify the application of 2511(c) to disclosures of trade secrets or domestic gossip or  other information of purely private concern. Cf. Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U.S.  374, 387-388 (1967) (reserving the question whether truthful publication of  private matters unrelated to public affairs can be constitutionally proscribed).  In other words, the outcome of the case does not turn on whether 2511(1)(c) may  be enforced with respect to most violations of the statute without offending the  First Amendment. The enforcement of that provision in this case, however,  implicates the core purposes of the First Amendment because it imposes sanctions  on the publication of truthful information of public concern.~    ~    ~      41~      In this case, privacy concerns give way when balanced against the interest in publishing matters of public importance. As Warren and Brandeis stated in  their classic law review article: \"The right of privacy does not prohibit any  publication of matter which is of public or general interest.\" The Right to  Privacy, 4 Harv. L. Rev. 193, 214 (1890). One of the costs associated with  participation in public affairs is an attendant loss of privacy.  \"Exposure of the self to others in varying degrees is a concomitant of life in a  civilized community. The risk of this exposure is an essential incident of life  in a society which places a primary value on freedom of speech and of press.  'Freedom of discussion, if it would fulfill its historic function in this  nation, must embrace all issues about which information is needed or appropriate  to enable the members of society to cope with the exigencies of their period.' \"  Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U.S., at 388 (quoting Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U.S. 88,  102 (1940)).21~    ~    ~      42~      Our opinion in New York Times Co. v.

United States, 354 U.S. 476, 484 (1957); Bridges v. California,  314 U.S. 252, 270 (1941); Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. 359, 369 (1931).  Those cases all relied on our \"profound national commitment to the principle  that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust and wide-open,\" New  York Times, 376 U.S., at 270; see Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 4 (1949);  De Jonge v. Oregon, 299 U.S. 353, 365 (1937); Whitney v.

It was the overriding  importance of that commitment that supported our holding that neither factual  error nor defamatory content, nor a combination of the two, sufficed to remove  the First Amendment shield from criticism of official conduct. Id., at 273; see  also NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 445 (1963); Wood v. Georgia, 370 U.S. 375  (1962); Craig v. Harney, 331 U.S. 367 (1947); Pennekamp v.

That debate may be more mundane  than the Communist rhetoric that inspired Justice Brandeis' classic opinion in  Whitney v. California, 274 U.S., at 372, but it is no less worthy of  constitutional protection.~    ~    ~      44~      The judgment is affirmed.~    ~    ~      45~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      46~      Breyer, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which O'Connor, J., joined.~    ~    ~      47~      Rehnquist, C.

In  the opinion of the majority, the defendant acted unlawfully in accepting the  tape in order to provide it to the media. Id., at 476. Apparently because the  couple responsible for the interception did not eavesdrop \"for purposes of  direct or indirect commercial advantage or private financial gain,\" they were  fined only $500. See Department of Justice Press Release, Apr. 23, 1997. In  another similar case involving a claim for damages under 2511(1)(c), Peavy v.  WFAA-TV, Inc., 221 F.3d 158 (CA5 2000), the media defendant in fact participated  in the interceptions at issue.~      ~      ~        6~          In particular, calls placed on cellular and cordless telephones can be intercepted more easily than those placed on traditional phones. See Shubert v.  Metrophone, Inc., 898 F.2d 401, 404-405 (CA3 1990). Although calls placed on  cell and cordless phones can be easily intercepted, it is not clear how often  intentional interceptions take place. From 1992 through 1997, less than 100  cases were prosecuted charging violations of 18 U.S.C.  2511. See Statement of  James K. Kallstrom, Assistant Director in Charge of the New York Division of the  FBI on February 5, 1997 before the Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Trade,  and Consumer Protection, Committee on Commerce, U.S. House of Representatives  Regarding Cellular Privacy. However, information concerning techniques and  devices for intercepting cell and cordless phone calls can be found in a number  of publications, trade magazines, and sites on the Internet, see id., at 6, and  at one set of congressional hearings in 1997, a scanner, purchased off the shelf  and minimally modified, was used to intercept phone calls of Members of  Congress.~      ~      ~        7~          See, e.g., Nix v.

The Government also points to two other  areas of the law-namely, mail theft and stolen property-in which a ban on the  receipt or possession of an item is used to deter some primary illegality. Brief  for United States 14; see also post, at 11. Neither of those examples, though,  involve prohibitions on speech. As such, they are not relevant to a First  Amendment analysis.~      ~      ~        14~          The media respondents have included a list of 143 cases under 2511(1)(a) and 63 cases under 2511(1)(c) and (d)-which must also involve violations of  subsection (a)-in an appendix to their brief. The Reply Brief filed by the  United States contains an appendix describing each of the cases in the latter  group.~      ~      ~        15~          In only 5 of the 206 cases listed in the appendices, see n. 14, supra, n. 17, infra, was the identity of the interceptor wholly unknown.~      ~      ~        16~          The legislative history of the 1968 Act indicates that Congress' concern focused on private surveillance \"in domestic relations and industrial espionage  situations.\" S. Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 225 (1968). Similarly, in  connection with the enactment of the 1986 amendment, one senator referred to the  interest in protecting private communications from \"a corporate spy, a police  officer without probable cause, or just a plain snoop.\" 131 Cong. Rec. 24366  (1985) (statement of Sen. Leahy).~      ~      ~        17~          The dissent argues that we have not given proper respect to \"congressional findings\" or to \" 'Congress' factual predictions.' \" Post, at 10. But the  relevant factual foundation is not to be found in the legislative record.  Moreover, the dissent does not argue that Congress did provide empirical  evidence in support of its assumptions, nor, for that matter, does it take real  issue with the fact that in the vast majority of cases involving illegal  interceptions, the identity of the person or persons responsible for the  interceptions is known. Instead, the dissent advances a minor disagreement with  our numbers, stating that nine cases \"involved an unknown or unproved  eavesdropper.\" Post, at 13-14, n. 9 (emphasis added). The dissent includes in  that number cases in which the identity of the interceptor, though suspected,  was not \"proved\" because the identity of the interceptor was not at issue or the  evidence was insufficient. In any event, whether there are 5 cases or 9  involving anonymous interceptors out of the 206 cases under 2511, in most of  the cases involving illegal interceptions, the identity of the interceptor is no  mystery. If, as the proponents of the dry up the market theory would have it, it  is difficult to identify the persons responsible for illegal interceptions (and  thus necessary to prohibit disclosure by third parties with no connection to, or  responsibility for, the initial illegality), one would expect to see far more  cases in which the identity of the interceptor was unknown (and, concomitantly,  far fewer in which the interceptor remained anonymous). Thus, not only is there  a dearth of evidence in the legislative record to support the dry up the market  theory, but what postenactment evidence is available cuts against it.~      ~      ~        18~          Indeed, even the burden of justifying restrictions on commercial speech requires more than \"mere speculation or conjecture.\" Greater New Orleans  Broadcasting Assn., Inc. v.

I write separately to explain why,  in my view, the Court's holding does not imply a significantly broader  constitutional immunity for the media.~    ~    ~      50~      As the Court recognizes, the question before us-a question of immunity from  statutorily imposed civil liability-implicates competing constitutional  concerns. Ante, at 17-18. The statutes directly interfere with free expression  in that they prevent the media from publishing information. At the same time,  they help to protect personal privacy-an interest here that includes not only  the \"right to be let alone,\" Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 478 (1928)  (Brandeis, J., dissenting), but also \"the interest . . . in fostering private  speech,\" ante, at 2. Given these competing interests \"on both sides of the  equation, the key question becomes one of proper fit.\" Turner Broadcasting  System, Inc. v. FCC, 520 U.S. 180, 227 (1997) (Breyer, J., concurring in part).  See also Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U.S. 377, 402 (2000)  (Breyer, J., concurring).~    ~    ~      51~      I would ask whether the statutes strike a reasonable balance between their  speech-restricting and speech-enhancing consequences. Or do they instead impose restrictions on speech that are disproportionate when measured against their  corresponding privacy and speech-related benefits, taking into account the kind,  the importance, and the extent of these benefits, as well as the need for the  restrictions in order to secure those benefits? What this Court has called  \"strict scrutiny\"-with its strong presumption against constitutionality-is  normally out of place where, as here, important competing constitutional  interests are implicated. See ante, at 2 (recognizing \"conflict between  interests of the highest order\"); ante, at 18 (\"important interests to be  considered on both sides of the constitutional calculus\"); ibid. (\"balanc[ing]\"  the interest in privacy \"against the interest in publishing matters of public  importance\"); ante, at 18-19 (privacy interest outweighed in these cases).~    ~    ~      52~      The statutory restrictions before us directly enhance private speech. See  Harper  Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539, 559 (1985)  (describing \" 'freedom not to speak publicly' \" (quoting Estate of Hemingway v.  Random House, Inc., 23 N. Y.2d 341, 348, 244 N. E.2d 250, 255 (1968))). The  statutes ensure the privacy of telephone conversations much as a trespass  statute ensures privacy within the home. That assurance of privacy helps to  overcome our natural reluctance to discuss private matters when we fear that our  private conversations may become public. And the statutory restrictions  consequently encourage conversations that otherwise might not take place.~    ~    ~      53~      At the same time, these statutes restrict public speech directly,  deliberately, and of necessity. They include media publication within their  scope not simply as a means, say, to deter interception, but also as an end.  Media dissemination of an intimate conversation to an entire community will  often cause the speakers serious harm over and above the harm caused by an  initial disclosure to the person who intercepted the phone call. See Gelbard v.  United States, 408 U.S. 41, 51-52 (1972). And the threat of that widespread  dissemination can create a far more powerful disincentive to speak privately  than the comparatively minor threat of disclosure to an interceptor and perhaps  to a handful of others. Insofar as these statutes protect private communications  against that widespread dissemination, they resemble laws that would award  damages caused through publication of information obtained by theft from a  private bedroom. See generally Warren  Brandeis, The Right to Privacy, 4 Harv.  L. Rev. 193 (1890) (hereinafter Warren  Brandeis). See also Restatement  (Second) of Torts 652D (1977).~    ~    ~      54~      As a general matter, despite the statutes' direct restrictions on speech,  the Federal Constitution must tolerate laws of this kind because of the  importance of these privacy and speech-related objectives. See Warren  Brandeis  196 (arguing for state law protection of the right to privacy). Cf. Katz v.  United States, 389 U.S. 347, 350-351 (1967) (\"[T]he protection of a person's  general right to privacy-his right to be let alone by other people-is, like the  protection of his property and of his very life, left largely to the law of the  individual States\"); ante, at 2 (protecting privacy and promoting speech are  \"interests of the highest order\"). Rather than broadly forbid this kind of  legislative enactment, the Constitution demands legislative efforts to tailor  the laws in order reasonably to reconcile media freedom with personal,  speech-related privacy.~    ~    ~      55~      Nonetheless, looked at more specifically, the statutes, as applied in these  circumstances, do not reasonably reconcile the competing constitutional  objectives. Rather, they disproportionately interfere with media freedom. For  one thing, the broadcasters here engaged in no unlawful activity other than the  ultimate publication of the information another had previously obtained. They  \"neither encouraged nor participated directly or indirectly in the  interception.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 33a. See also ante, at 9-10. No one claims  that they ordered, counseled, encouraged, or otherwise aided or abetted the  interception, the later delivery of the tape by the interceptor to an  intermediary, or the tape's still later delivery by the intermediary to the  media. Cf. 18 U.S.C.  2 (criminalizing aiding and abetting any federal  offense); 2 W. LaFave  A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law 6.6(b)-(c), pp.  128-129 (1986) (describing criminal liability for aiding and abetting). And, as  the Court points out, the statutes do not forbid the receipt of the tape itself.  Ante, at 9. The Court adds that its holding \"does not apply to punishing parties  for obtaining the relevant information unlawfully.\" Ante, at 17, n. 19 (emphasis  added).~    ~    ~      56~      For another thing, the speakers had little or no legitimate interest in  maintaining the privacy of the particular conversation. That conversation  involved a suggestion about \"blow[ing] off . . . front porches\" and \"do[ing]  some work on some of these guys,\" App. 46, thereby raising a significant concern  for the safety of others. Where publication of private information constitutes a  wrongful act, the law recognizes a privilege allowing the reporting of threats  to public safety. See Restatement (Second) of Torts 595, Comment g (1977)  (general privilege to report that \"another intends to kill or rob or commit some  other serious crime against a third person\"); id., 652G (privilege applies to  invasion of privacy tort). Cf. Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition 40,  Comment c (1995) (trade secret law permits disclosures relevant to public health  or safety, commission of crime or tort, or other matters of substantial public  concern); Lachman v. Sperry-Sun Well Surveying Co., 457 F.2d 850, 853 (CA10  1972) (nondisclosure agreement not binding in respect to criminal activity);  Tarasoff v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 17 Cal. 3d 425, 436, 551 P.2d 334, 343-344  (1976) (psychiatric privilege not binding in presence of danger to self or  others). Even where the danger may have passed by the time of publication, that  fact cannot legitimize the speaker's earlier privacy expectation. Nor should  editors, who must make a publication decision quickly, have to determine present  or continued danger before publishing this kind of threat.~    ~    ~      57~      Further, the speakers themselves, the president of a teacher's union and the union's chief negotiator, were \"limited public figures,\" for they voluntarily  engaged in a public controversy. They thereby subjected themselves to somewhat  greater public scrutiny and had a lesser interest in privacy than an individual  engaged in purely private affairs. See, e.g., ante, at 19 (respondents were  engaged in matter of public concern); Wolston v. Reader's Digest Assn., Inc.,  443 U.S. 157, 164 (1979); Hutchinson v. Proxmire, 443 U.S. 111, 134 (1979);  Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 351 (1974). See also Warren   Brandeis 215.~    ~    ~      58~      This is not to say that the Constitution requires anyone, including public figures, to give up entirely the right to private communication, i.e.,  communication free from telephone taps or interceptions. But the subject matter  of the conversation at issue here is far removed from that in situations where  the media publicizes truly private matters. See Michaels v. Internet  Entertainment Group, Inc., 5 F. Supp. 2d 823, 841-842 (C.D. Cal. 1998)  (broadcast of videotape recording of sexual relations between famous actress and  rock star not a matter of legitimate public concern); W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R.  Keeton,  D.

Cf. Time, Inc. v.  Firestone, 424 U.S. 448, 454-455 (1976) (despite interest of public, divorce of  wealthy person not a \"public controversy\"). Cf. also ante, at 18 (\"[S]ome  intrusions on privacy are more offensive than  others\").~    ~    ~      59~      Thus, in finding a constitutional privilege to publish unlawfully  intercepted conversations of the kind here at issue, the Court does not create a  \"public interest\" exception that swallows up the statutes' privacy-protecting  general rule. Rather, it finds constitutional protection for publication of  intercepted information of a special kind. Here, the speakers' legitimate  privacy expectations are unusually low, and the public interest in defeating  those expectations is unusually high. Given these circumstances, along with the  lawful nature of respondents' behavior, the statutes' enforcement would  disproportionately harm media freedom.~    ~    ~      60~      I emphasize the particular circumstances before us because, in my view, the  Constitution permits legislatures to respond flexibly to the challenges future  technology may pose to the individual's interest in basic personal privacy.  Clandestine and pervasive invasions of privacy, unlike the simple theft of  documents from a bedroom, are genuine possibilities as a result of continuously  advancing technologies. Eavesdropping on ordinary cellular phone conversations  in the street (which many callers seem to tolerate) is a very different matter  from eavesdropping on encrypted cellular phone conversations or those carried on  in the bedroom. But the technologies that allow the former may come to permit  the latter. And statutes that may seem less important in the former context may turn out to have greater  importance in the latter. Legislatures also may decide to revisit statutes such as those before us, creating  better tailored provisions designed to encourage, for example, more effective  privacy-protecting technologies.~    ~    ~      61~      For these reasons, we should avoid adopting overly broad or rigid  constitutional rules, which would unnecessarily restrict legislative  flexibility. I consequently agree with the Court's holding that the statutes as  applied here violate the Constitution, but I would not extend that holding  beyond these present circumstances.~    ~    ~      62~      Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas join,  dissenting.~    ~    ~      63~      Technology now permits millions of important and confidential conversations  to occur through a vast system of electronic networks. These advances, however,  raise significant privacy concerns. We are placed in the uncomfortable position  of not knowing who might have access to our personal and business e-mails, our  medical and financial records, or our cordless and cellular telephone  conversations. In an attempt to prevent some of the most egregious violations of  privacy, the United States, the District of Columbia, and 40 States have enacted  laws prohibiting the intentional interception and knowing disclosure of  electronic communications.1 The Court holds that all of these statutes violate  the First Amendment insofar as the illegally intercepted conversation touches  upon a matter of \"public concern,\" an amorphous concept that the Court does not  even attempt to define. But the Court's decision diminishes, rather than  enhances, the purposes of the First Amendment: chilling the speech of the  millions of Americans who rely upon electronic technology to communicate each  day.~    ~    ~      64~      Over 30 years ago, with Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe  Streets Act of 1968, Congress recognized that the \"[t]remendous scientific and technological developments that have taken place in  the last century have made possible today the widespread use and abuse of  electronic surveillance techniques. As a result of these developments, privacy  of communication is seriously jeopardized by these techniques of surveillance\" .  No longer is it possible, in short, for each man to retreat into his home and be  left alone. Every spoken word relating to each man's personal, marital,  religious, political, or commercial concerns can be intercepted by an unseen  auditor and turned against the speaker to the auditor's advantage.\" S. Rep. No.  1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 67 (1968) (hereinafter S. Rep. No. 1097). This concern for privacy was inseparably bound up with the desire that personal  conversations be frank and uninhibited, not cramped by fears of clandestine  surveillance and purposeful disclosure:~    ~    ~      65~      \"In a democratic society privacy of communication is essential if citizens are  to think and act creatively and constructively. Fear or suspicion that one's  speech is being monitored by a stranger, even without the reality of such  activity, can have a seriously inhibiting effect upon the willingness to voice  critical and constructive ideas.\" President's Commission on Law Enforcement and  Administration of Justice, The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society 202 (1967). To effectuate these important privacy and speech interests, Congress and the  vast majority of States have proscribed the intentional interception and knowing  disclosure of the contents of electronic communications.2 See, e.g., 18 U.S.C.   2511(1)(c) (placing restrictions upon \"any person who \" intentionally discloses,  or endeavors to disclose, to any other person the contents of any wire, oral, or  electronic communication, knowing or having reason to know that the information  was obtained through the interception of a wire, oral, or electronic  communication\").~    ~    ~      66~      The Court correctly observes that these are \"content-neutral law[s] of  general applicability\" which serve recognized interests of the \"highest order\":  \"the interest in individual privacy and \" in fostering private speech.\" Ante, at  10, 2. It nonetheless subjects these laws to the strict scrutiny normally  reserved for governmental attempts to censor different viewpoints or ideas. See  ante, at 16 (holding that petitioners have not established the requisite \" 'need  of the highest order' \") (quoting Smith v. Daily Mail Publishing Co., 443 U.S.  97, 103 (1979)). There is scant support, either in precedent or in reason, for  the Court's tacit application of strict scrutiny.~    ~    ~      67~      A content-neutral regulation will be sustained if~    ~    ~      68~      \" 'it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest; if the  governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression; and if  the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is no greater  than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.' \" Turner Broadcasting  System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 662 (1994) (quoting United States v. O'Brien,  391 U.S. 367, 377 (1968)).~    ~    ~      69~      Here, Congress and the Pennsylvania Legislature have acted \" 'without reference  to the content of the regulated speech.' \" Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc.,  475 U.S. 41, 48 (1986). There is no intimation that these laws seek \"to suppress  unpopular ideas or information or manipulate the public debate\" or that they  \"distinguish favored speech from disfavored speech on the basis of the ideas or  views expressed.\" Turner Broadcasting, supra, at 641, 643. The antidisclosure  provision is based solely upon the manner in which the conversation was  acquired, not the subject matter of the conversation or the viewpoints of the  speakers. The same information, if obtained lawfully, could be published with  impunity. Cf. Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart, 467 U.S. 20, 34 (1984) (upholding  under intermediate scrutiny a protective order on information acquired during  discovery in part because \"the party may disseminate the identical information \"  as long as the information is gained through means independent of the court's  processes\"). As the concerns motivating strict scrutiny are absent, these  content-neutral restrictions upon speech need pass only intermediate scrutiny.~    ~    ~      70~      The Court's attempt to avoid these precedents by reliance upon the Daily  Mail string of newspaper cases is unpersuasive. In these cases, we held that  statutes prohibiting the media from publishing certain truthful information-the  name of a rape victim, Florida Star v. B. J. F., 491 U.S. 524 (1989); Cox  Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U.S. 469 (1975), the confidential proceedings  before a state judicial review commission, Landmark Communications, Inc. v.  Virginia, 435 U.S. 829 (1978), and the name of a juvenile defendant, Daily Mail,  supra; Oklahoma Publishing Co. v. District Court, Oklahoma Cty., 430 U.S. 308  (1977) (per curiam)-violated the First Amendment. In so doing, we stated that  \"if a newspaper lawfully obtains truthful information about a matter of public  significance then state officials may not constitutionally punish publication of  the information, absent a need to further a state interest of the highest  order.\" Daily Mail, supra, at 103. Neither this Daily Mail principle nor any  other aspect of these cases, however, justifies the Court's imposition of strict  scrutiny here.~    ~    ~      71~      Each of the laws at issue in the Daily Mail cases regulated the content or  subject matter of speech. This fact alone was enough to trigger strict scrutiny,  see United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000)  (\"[A] content-based speech restriction \" can stand only if it satisfies strict  scrutiny\"), and suffices to distinguish these antidisclosure provisions. But, as  our synthesis of these cases in Florida Star made clear, three other unique  factors also informed the scope of the Daily Mail principle.~    ~    ~      72~      First, the information published by the newspapers had been lawfully obtained from the government itself.3 \"Where information is entrusted to the  government, a less drastic means than punishing truthful publication almost  always exists for guarding against the dissemination of private facts.\" Florida  Star, supra, at 534. See, e.g., Landmark Communications, supra, at 841, and n.  12 (noting that the State could have taken steps to protect the confidentiality  of its proceedings, such as holding in contempt commission members who breached  their duty of confidentiality). Indeed, the State's ability to control the  information undermined the claim that the restriction was necessary, for \"[b]y  placing the information in the public domain on official court records, the  State must be presumed to have concluded that the public interest was thereby  being served.\" Cox Broadcasting, supra, at 495. This factor has no relevance in  the present cases, where we deal with private conversations that have been  intentionally kept out of the public domain.~    ~    ~      73~      Second, the information in each case was already \"publicly available,\" and punishing further dissemination would not have advanced the purported government  interests of confidentiality. Florida Star, supra, at 535. Such is not the case  here. These statutes only prohibit \"disclos[ure],\" 18 U.S.C.  2511(1)(c); 18  Pa. Cons. Stat. 5703(2) (2000), and one cannot \"disclose\" what is already in  the public domain. See Black's Law Dictionary 477 (7th ed. 1999) (defining  \"disclosure\" as \"[t]he act or process of making known something that was  previously unknown; a revelation of facts\"); S. Rep. No. 1097, at 93 (\"The  disclosure of the contents of an intercepted communication that had already  become 'public information' or 'common knowledge' would not be prohibited\").  These laws thus do not fall under the axiom that \"the interests in privacy fade  when the information involved already appears on the public record.\" Cox  Broadcasting, supra, at 494-495.~    ~    ~      74~      Third, these cases were concerned with \"the 'timidity and self-censorship' which may result from allowing the media to be punished for publishing certain  truthful information.\" Florida Star, 491 U.S., at 535. But fear of \"timidity and  self-censorship\" is a basis for upholding, not striking down, these  antidisclosure provisions: They allow private conversations to transpire without  inhibition. And unlike the statute at issue in Florida Star, which had no  scienter requirement, see id., at 539, these statutes only address those who  knowingly disclose an illegally intercepted conversation.4 They do not impose a  duty to inquire into the source of the information and one could negligently  disclose the contents of an illegally intercepted communication without  liability.~    ~    ~      75~      In sum, it is obvious that the Daily Mail cases upon which the Court relies do not address the question presented here. Our decisions themselves made this  clear: \"The Daily Mail principle does not settle the issue whether, in cases  where information has been acquired unlawfully by a newspaper or by a source,  the government may ever punish not only the unlawful acquisition, but the  ensuing publication as well.\" Florida Star, supra, at 535, n. 8; see also Daily  Mail, 443 U.S., at 105 (\"Our holding in this case is narrow. There is no issue  before us of unlawful press [conduct]\"); Landmark Communications, 435 U.S., at  837 (\"We are not here concerned with the possible applicability of the statute  to one who secures the information by illegal means and thereafter divulges  it\").5~    ~    ~      76~      Undaunted, the Court places an inordinate amount of weight upon the fact that the receipt of an illegally intercepted communication has not been  criminalized. See ante, at 13-17. But this hardly renders those who knowingly  receive and disclose such communications \"law-abiding,\" ante, at 14, and it  certainly does not bring them under the Daily Mail principle. The transmission  of the intercepted communication from the eavesdropper to the third party is  itself illegal; and where, as here, the third party then knowingly discloses  that communication, another illegal act has been committed. The third party in  this situation cannot be likened to the reporters in the Daily Mail cases, who  lawfully obtained their information through consensual interviews or public  documents.~    ~    ~      77~      These laws are content neutral; they only regulate information that was illegally obtained; they do not restrict republication of what is already in the  public domain; they impose no special burdens upon the media; they have a  scienter requirement to provide fair warning; and they promote the privacy and  free speech of those using cellular telephones. It is hard to imagine a more  narrowly tailored prohibition of the disclosure of illegally intercepted  communications, and it distorts our precedents to review these statutes under  the often fatal standard of strict scrutiny. These laws therefore should be  upheld if they further a substantial governmental interest unrelated to the  suppression of free speech, and they do.~    ~    ~      78~      Congress and the overwhelming majority of States reasonably have concluded that sanctioning the knowing disclosure of illegally intercepted communications  will deter the initial interception itself, a crime which is extremely difficult  to detect. It is estimated that over 20 million scanners capable of intercepting  cellular transmissions currently are in operation, see Thompson, Cell Phone  Snooping: Why Electronic Eavesdropping Goes Unpunished, 35 Am. Crim. L. Rev.  137, 149 (1997), notwithstanding the fact that Congress prohibited the marketing  of such devices eight years ago, see 47 U.S.C.  302a(d).6 As Congress  recognized, \"[a]ll too often the invasion of privacy itself will go unknown.  Only by striking at all aspects of the problem can privacy be adequately  protected.\" S. Rep. No. 1097, at 69. See also Hearings on H. R. 3378 before the  Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties, and the Administration of Justice of  the House Committee on the Judiciary, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. and 2d Sess., 290  (1986) (\"Congress should be under no illusion \" that the Department [of  Justice], because of the difficulty of such investigations, would be able to  bring a substantial number of successful prosecutions\").~    ~    ~      79~      Nonetheless, the Court faults Congress for providing \"no empirical evidence to support the assumption that the prohibition against disclosures reduces the  number of illegal interceptions,\" ante, at 15-16, and insists that \"there is no  basis for assuming that imposing sanctions upon respondents will deter the  unidentified scanner from continuing to engage in surreptitious interceptions,\"  ante, at 16. It is the Court's reasoning, not the judgment of Congress and  numerous States regarding the necessity of these laws, which disappoints.~    ~    ~      80~      The \"quantum of empirical evidence needed to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny of legislative judgments will vary up or down with the novelty and  plausibility of the justification raised.\" Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government  PAC, 528 U.S. 377, 391 (2000). \"[C]ourts must accord substantial deference to  the predictive judgments of Congress.\" Turner Broadcasting, 512 U.S., at 665  (citing Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee, 412  U.S. 94, 103 (1973)). This deference recognizes that, as an institution,  Congress is far better equipped than the judiciary to evaluate the vast amounts  of data bearing upon complex issues and that \"[s]ound policymaking often  requires legislators to forecast future events and to anticipate the likely  impact of these events based on deductions and inferences for which complete  empirical support may be unavailable.\" Turner Broadcasting, 512 U.S., at 665.  Although we must nonetheless independently evaluate such congressional findings  in performing our constitutional review, this \"is not a license to reweigh the  evidence de novo, or to replace Congress' factual predictions with our own.\"  Id., at 666.~    ~    ~      81~      The \"dry up the market\" theory, which posits that it is possible to deter an illegal act that is difficult to police by preventing the wrongdoer from  enjoying the fruits of the crime, is neither novel nor implausible. It is a  time-tested theory that undergirds numerous laws, such as the prohibition of the  knowing possession of stolen goods. See 2 W. LaFave  A. Scott, Substantive  Criminal Law 8.10(a), p. 422 (1986) (\"Without such receivers, theft ceases to  be profitable. It is obvious that the receiver must be a principal target of any  society anxious to stamp out theft in its various forms\"). We ourselves adopted  the exclusionary rule based upon similar reasoning, believing that it would  \"deter unreasonable searches,\" Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. 298, 306 (1985), by  removing an officer's \"incentive to disregard [the Fourth Amendment],\" Elkins v.  United States, 364 U.S. 206, 217 (1960).7~    ~    ~      82~      The same logic applies here and demonstrates that the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is no greater than essential to further the  interest of protecting the privacy of individual communications. Were there no  prohibition on disclosure, an unlawful eavesdropper who wanted to disclose the  conversation could anonymously launder the interception through a third party  and thereby avoid detection. Indeed, demand for illegally obtained private  information would only increase if it could be disclosed without repercussion.  The law against interceptions, which the Court agrees is valid, would be utterly  ineffectual without these antidisclosure provisions.~    ~    ~      83~      For a similar reason, we upheld against First Amendment challenge a law prohibiting the distribution of child pornography. See New York v. Ferber, 458  U.S. 747 (1982). Just as with unlawfully intercepted electronic communications,  we there noted the difficulty of policing the \"low-profile, clandestine  industry\" of child pornography production and concurred with 36 legislatures  that \"[t]he most expeditious if not the only practical method of law enforcement  may be to dry up the market for this material by imposing severe criminal  penalties on persons selling, advertising, or otherwise promoting the product.\"  Id., at 760. In so doing, we did not demand, nor did Congress provide, any  empirical evidence to buttress this basic syllogism. Indeed, we reaffirmed the  theory's vitality in Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103, 109-110 (1990), finding it  \"surely reasonable for the State to conclude that it will decrease the  production of child pornography if it penalizes those who possess and view the  product, thereby decreasing demand.\"8~    ~    ~      84~      At base, the Court's decision to hold these statutes unconstitutional rests upon nothing more than the bald substitution of its own prognostications in  place of the reasoned judgment of 41 legislative bodies and the United States  Congress.9 The Court does not explain how or from where Congress should obtain  statistical evidence about the effectiveness of these laws, and \"[s]ince as a  practical matter it is never easy to prove a negative, it is hardly likely that  conclusive factual data could ever be assembled.\" Elkins, supra, at 218.  Reliance upon the \"dry up the market\" theory is both logical and eminently  reasonable, and our precedents make plain that it is \"far stronger than mere  speculation.\" United States v. Treasury Employees, 513 U.S. 454, 475 (1995).~    ~    ~      85~      These statutes also protect the important interests of deterring clandestine invasions of privacy and preventing the involuntary broadcast of private  communications. Over a century ago, Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis recognized  that \"[t]he intensity and complexity of life, attendant upon advancing  civilization, have rendered necessary some retreat from the world, and man,  under the refining influence of culture, has become more sensitive to publicity,  so that solitude and privacy have become more essential to the individual.\" The  Right to Privacy, 4 Harv. L. Rev. 193, 196 (1890). \"There is necessarily, and  within suitably defined areas, a \" freedom not to speak publicly, one which  serves the same ultimate end as freedom of speech in its affirmative aspect.\"  Harper  Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539, 559 (1985)  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). One who speaks into a phone \"is  surely entitled to assume that the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not  be broadcast to the world.\" Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 352 (1967); cf.  Gelbard v. United States, 408 U.S. 41, 52 (1972) (compelling testimony about  matters obtained from an illegal interception at a grand jury proceeding  \"compounds the statutorily proscribed invasion of \" privacy by adding to the  injury of the interception the insult of \" disclosure\").~    ~    ~      86~      These statutes undeniably protect this venerable right of privacy. Concomitantly, they further the First Amendment rights of the parties to the  conversation. \"At the heart of the First Amendment lies the principle that each  person should decide for himself or herself the ideas and beliefs deserving of  expression, consideration, and adherence.\" Turner Broadcasting, 512 U.S., at  641. By \"protecting the privacy of individual thought and expression,\" United  States v. United States Dist. Court for Eastern Dist. of Mich., 407 U.S. 297,  302 (1972), these statutes further the \"uninhibited, robust, and wide-open\"  speech of the private parties, New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 270  (1964). Unlike the laws at issue in the Daily Mail cases, which served only to  protect the identities and actions of a select group of individuals, these laws  protect millions of people who communicate electronically on a daily basis. The  chilling effect of the Court's decision upon these private conversations will  surely be great: An estimated 49.1 million analog cellular telephones are  currently in operation. See Hao, Nokia Profits from Surge in Cell Phones, Fla.  Today, July 18, 1999, p. E1.~    ~    ~      87~      Although the Court recognizes and even extols the virtues of this right to privacy, see ante, at 17-18, these are \"mere words,\" W. Shakespeare, Troilus and  Cressida, act v, sc. 3, overridden by the Court's newfound right to publish  unlawfully acquired information of \"public concern,\" ante, at 10. The Court  concludes that the private conversation between Gloria Bartnicki and Anthony  Kane is somehow a \"debate \" . worthy of constitutional protection.\" Ante, at 20.  Perhaps the Court is correct that \"[i]f the statements about the labor  negotiations had been made in a public arena-during a bargaining session, for  example-they would have been newsworthy.\" Ante, at 10. The point, however, is  that Bartnicki and Kane had no intention of contributing to a public \"debate\" at  all, and it is perverse to hold that another's unlawful interception and knowing  disclosure of their conversation is speech \"worthy of constitutional  protection.\" Cf. Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of  Boston, Inc., 515 U.S. 557, 573 (1995) (\"[O]ne important manifestation of the  principle of free speech is that one who chooses to speak may also decide 'what  not to say' \"). The Constitution should not protect the involuntary broadcast of  personal conversations. Even where the communications involve public figures or  concern public matters, the conversations are nonetheless private and worthy of  protection. Although public persons may have forgone the right to live their  lives screened from public scrutiny in some areas, it does not and should not  follow that they also have abandoned their right to have a private conversation  without fear of it being intentionally intercepted and knowingly disclosed.~    ~    ~      88~      The Court's decision to hold inviolable our right to broadcast conversations of \"public importance\" enjoys little support in our precedents. As discussed  above, given the qualified nature of their holdings, the Daily Mail cases cannot  bear the weight the Court places upon them. More mystifying still is the Court's  reliance upon the \"Pentagon Papers\" case, New York Times Co. v. United States,  403 U.S. 713 (1971) (per curiam), which involved the United States' attempt to  prevent the publication of Defense Department documents relating to the Vietnam  War. In addition to involving Government controlled information, that case fell  squarely under our precedents holding that prior restraints on speech bear \" 'a  heavy presumption against \" constitutionality.' \" Id., at 714. Indeed, it was  this presumption that caused Justices Stewart and White to join the 6-to-3 per  curiam decision. See id., at 730-731 (White, J., joined by Stewart, J.,  concurring) (\"I concur in today's judgments, but only because of the concededly  extraordinary protection against prior restraints enjoyed by the press under our  constitutional system\"). By no stretch of the imagination can the statutes at  issue here be dubbed \"prior restraints.\" And the Court's \"parallel reasoning\"  from other inapposite cases fails to persuade. Ante, at 20.~    ~    ~      89~      Surely \"the interest in individual privacy,\" ante, at 2, at its narrowest must embrace the right to be free from surreptitious eavesdropping on, and  involuntary broadcast of, our cellular telephone conversations. The Court  subordinates that right, not to the claims of those who themselves wish to  speak, but to the claims of those who wish to publish the intercepted  conversations of others. Congress' effort to balance the above claim to privacy  against a marginal claim to speak freely is thereby set at naught.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~          See 18 U.S.C.  2511(1) (1994 ed. and Supp. V); Ala.

The Court also posits that Congress here could  simply have increased the penalty for intercepting cellular communications. See  ante, at 14. But the Court's back-seat legislative advice does nothing to  undermine the reasonableness of Congress' belief that prohibiting only the  initial interception would not effectively protect the privacy interests of  cellular telephone users.~      ~      ~        9~          The Court observes that in many of the cases litigated under 2511(1), \"the  person or persons intercepting the communication ha[ve] been known.\" Ante, at  15. Of the 206 cases cited in the appendices, 143 solely involved 2511(1)(a)  claims of wrongful interception-disclosure was not at issue. It is of course  unremarkable that intentional interception cases have not been pursued where the  identity of the eavesdropper was unknown. Of the 61 disclosure and use cases  with published facts brought under 2511(1)(c) and (d), 9 involved an unknown  or unproved eavesdropper, 1 involved a lawful pen register, and 5 involved  recordings that were not surreptitious. Thus, as relevant, 46 disclosure cases  involved known eavesdroppers. Whatever might be gleaned from this figure, the  Court is practicing voodoo statistics when it states that it undermines the \"dry  up the market\" theory. See ante, at 16, n. 17. These cases say absolutely  nothing about the interceptions and disclosures that have been deterred.~      ~    ~    ",

HATTER, Jr., JUDGE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, et al.~    No. 99-1978.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued February 20, 2001Decided May 21, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      In 1982, Congress extended Medicare to federal employees. That new law meant,  inter alia, that then-sitting federal judges, like all other federal employees  and most other citizens, began to have Medicare taxes withheld from their  salaries. In 1983, Congress required all newly hired federal employees to  participate in Social Security and permitted, without requiring, about 96% of  the then-currently employed federal employees to participate in that program.  The remaining 4%-a class consisting of the President, other high-level  Government employees, and all federal judges-were required to participate,  except that those who contributed to a \"covered\" retirement program could modify  their participation in a manner that left their total payroll deduction for  retirement and Social Security unchanged, in effect allowing them to avoid any  additional financial obligation as a result of joining Social Security. A  \"covered\" program was defined to include any retirement system to which an  employee had to contribute, which did not encompass the noncontributory pension  system for federal judges, whose financial obligations (and payroll deductions)  therefore had to increase. A number of federal judges appointed before 1983  filed this suit, arguing that the 1983 law violated the Compensation Clause,  which guarantees federal judges a \"Compensation, which shall not be diminished  during their Continuance in Office,\" U.S. Const., Art. III, 1. Initially, the  Court of Federal Claims ruled against the judges, but the Federal Circuit  reversed. On certiorari, because some Justices were disqualified and this Court  failed to find a quorum, the Federal Circuit's judgment was affirmed \"with the  same effect as upon affirmance by an equally divided court.\" 519 U.S. 801. On  remand, the Court of Federal Claims found that the judges' Medicare claims were  time barred and that a 1984 judicial salary increase promptly cured any  violation, making damages minimal. The Federal Circuit reversed, holding that  the Compensation Clause prevented the Government from collecting Medicare and  Social Security taxes from the judges and that the violation was not cured by  the 1984 pay increase.~      Held:      1. The Compensation Clause prevents the Government from collecting Social  Security taxes, but not Medicare taxes, from federal judges who held office  before Congress extended those taxes to federal employees. Pp. 6-19.~      (a) The Court rejects the judges' claim that the \"law of the case\"  doctrine now prevents consideration of the Compensation Clause because an  affirmance by an equally divided Court is conclusive and binding upon the  parties. United States v. Pink, 315 U.S. 203, 216, on which the judges rely,  concerned an earlier case in which the Court heard oral argument and apparently  considered the merits before affirming by an equally divided Court. The law of  the case doctrine presumes a hearing on the merits. See, e.g., Quern v. Jordan,  440 U.S. 332, 347, n. 18. When this case previously was here, due to absence of  a quorum, the Court could not consider either the merits or whether to consider  those merits through a grant of certiorari. This fact, along with the obvious  difficulty of finding other equivalent substitute forums, convinces the Court  that Pink does not control here. Pp. 6-7.~      (b) Although the Compensation Clause prohibits taxation that singles out  judges for specially unfavorable treatment, it does not forbid Congress to enact  a law imposing a nondiscriminatory tax (including an increase in rates or a  change in conditions) upon judges and other citizens. See O'Malley v. Woodrough,  307 U.S. 277, 282. Insofar as Evans v. Gore, 253 U.S. 245, 255, holds to the  contrary, that case is overruled. See O'Malley, supra, at 283. There is no good  reason why a judge should not share the tax burdens borne by all citizens. See  Evans, supra, at 265, 267 (Holmes, J., dissenting); O'Malley, supra, at 281-283.  Although Congress cannot directly reduce judicial salaries even as part of an  equitable effort to reduce all Government salaries, a tax law, unlike a law  mandating a salary reduction, affects compensation indirectly, not directly. See  United States v. Will, 449 U.S. 200, 226. And those prophylactic considerations  that may justify an absolute rule forbidding direct salary reductions are absent  here, where indirect taxation is at issue. In practice, the likelihood that a  nondiscriminatory tax represents a disguised legislative effort to influence the  judicial will is virtually nonexistent. Hence the potential threats to judicial  independence that underlie the Compensation Clause, see Evans, supra, at  251-252, cannot justify a special judicial exemption from a commonly shared tax,  not even as a preventive measure to counter those threats. Because the Medicare  tax is nondiscriminatory, the Federal Circuit erred in finding its application  to federal judges unconstitutional. Pp. 7-13.~      (c) However, because the special retroactivity-related Social Security  rules enacted in 1983 effectively singled out then-sitting federal judges for  unfavorable treatment, the Compensation Clause forbids the application of the  Social Security tax to those judges. Four features of the law, taken together,  lead to the conclusion that it discriminates in a manner the Clause forbids.  First, the statutory history, context, purpose, and language indicate that the  category of \"federal employees\" is the appropriate class against which the  asserted discrimination must be measured. Second, the practical upshot of  defining \"covered\" system in the way the law did was to permit nearly every  then-current federal employee, but not federal judges, to avoid the newly  imposed obligation to pay Social Security taxes. Third, the new law imposed a  substantial cost on federal judges with little or no expectation of substantial  benefit for most of them. Inclusion meant a deduction of about $2,000 per year,  whereas 95% of the then-active judges had already qualified for Social Security  (due to private sector employment) before becoming judges. And participation  would benefit only the minority of judges who had not worked the quarters  necessary to be fully insured under Social Security. Fourth, the Government's  sole justification for the statutory distinction between judges and other  high-level federal employees-i.e., equalizing the financial burdens imposed by  the noncontributory judicial retirement system and the contributory system to  which the other employees belonged-is unsound because such equalization takes  place not by offering all current federal employees (including judges) the same  opportunities but by employing a statutory disadvantage which offsets an  advantage related to those protections afforded judges by the Clause, and  because the two systems are not equalized with any precision. Thus, the 1983 law  is very different from the nondiscriminatory tax upheld in O'Malley, supra, at  282. The Government's additional arguments-that Article III protects judges only  against a reduction in stated salary, not against indirect measures that only  reduce take-home pay; that there is no evidence here that Congress singled out  judges for special treatment in order to intimidate, influence, or punish them;  and that the law disfavored not only judges but also the President and other  high-ranking federal employees-are unconvincing. Pp. 13-19.~      2. The Compensation Clause violation was not cured by the 1984 pay increase  for federal judges. The context in which that increase took place reveals  nothing to suggest that it was intended to make whole the losses sustained by  the pre-1983 judges. Rather, everything in the record suggests that the increase  was meant to halt a slide in purchasing power resulting from continued and  unadjusted-for inflation. Although a circumstance-specific approach is more  complex than the Government's proposed automatic approach, whereby a later  salary increase would terminate a Compensation Clause violation regardless of  the increase's purpose, there is no reason why such relief as damages or an  exemption from Social Security would prove unworkable. Will, supra,  distinguished. Pp. 19-22.~      203 F.3d 795, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT~      Breyer, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and Kennedy, Souter, and Ginsburg, JJ., joined, and in which Scalia, J., joined as to Parts I, II, and V.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      The Constitution's Compensation Clause guarantees federal judges a  \"Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in  Office.\" U.S. Const., Art. III, 1. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit  held that this Clause prevents the Government from collecting certain Medicare  and Social Security taxes from a small number of federal judges who held office  nearly 20 years ago-before Congress extended the taxes to federal employees in  the early 1980's.~    ~    ~      2~      In our view, the Clause does not prevent Congress from imposing a  \"non-discriminatory tax laid generally\" upon judges and other citizens, O'Malley  v. Woodrough, 307 U.S. 277, 282 (1939), but it does prohibit taxation that  singles out judges for specially unfavorable treatment. Consequently, unlike the  Court of Appeals, we conclude that Congress may apply the Medicare tax-a  nondiscriminatory tax-to then-sitting federal judges. The special  retroactivity-related Social Security rules that Congress enacted in 1984,  however, effectively singled out then-sitting federal judges for unfavorable  treatment. Hence, like the Court of Appeals, we conclude that the Clause forbids  the application of the Social Security tax to those judges.~    ~    ~      3~      * A~    ~    ~      4~      The Medicare law before us is straightforward. In 1965, Congress created a  Federal Medicare \"hospital insurance\" program and tied its financing to Social  Security. See Social Security Amendments of 1965, 79 Stat. 291. The Medicare law  required most American workers (whom Social Security covered) to pay an  additional Medicare tax. But it did not require Federal Government employees  (whom Social Security did not cover) to pay that tax. See 26 U.S.C.   3121(b)(5), (6) (1982 ed.).~    ~    ~      5~      In 1982, Congress, believing that \"[f]ederal workers should bear a more  equitable share of the costs of financing the benefits to which many of them  eventually became entitled,\" S. Rep. No. 97-494, pt. 1, p. 378 (1982), extended  both Medicare eligibility and Medicare taxes to all currently employed federal  employees as well as to all newly hired federal employees, Tax Equity and Fiscal  Responsibility Act of 1982, 278, 96 Stat. 559-563. That new law meant that (as  of January 1, 1983) all federal judges, like all other federal employees and  most other citizens, would have to contribute between 1.30% and 1.45% of their  federal salaries to Medicare's hospital insurance system. See 26 U.S.C.   3101(b)(4)-(6).~    ~    ~      6~      The Social Security law before us is more complex. In 1935, Congress created  the Social Security program. See Social Security Act, 49 Stat. 620. For nearly  50 years, that program covered employees in the private sector, but it did not  cover Government employees. See 26 U.S.C.  3121(b)(5), (6) (1982 ed.)  (excluding federal employees); 3121(b)(7) (excluding state employees). In 1981,  a National Commission on Social Security Reform, convened by the President and  chaired by Alan Greenspan, noting the need for \"action ' to strengthen the  financial status\" of Social Security, recommended that Congress extend the  program to cover Federal, but not state or local, Government employees. Report  of the National Commission on Social Security Reform 2-1, 2-7 (Jan. 1983). In  particular, the Commission recommended that Congress require all incoming  federal employees (those hired after January 1, 1984) to enter the Social  Security system and to pay Social Security taxes. Id., at 2-7. The Commission  emphasized that \"present Federal employees will not be affected by this  recommendation.\" Id., at 2-8.~    ~    ~      7~      In 1983, Congress enacted the Commission's recommendation into law  (effective January 1, 1984) with an important exception. See Social Security  Amendments of 1983, 101(b)(1), 97 Stat. 69 (amending 26 U.S.C.  3121(b)(5),  (6)). As the Commission had recommended, Congress required all newly hired  federal employees to participate in the Social Security program. It also  permitted, without requiring, almost all (about 96%) then-currently employed  federal employees to participate.~    ~    ~      8~      Contrary to the Commission's recommendation, however, the law added an  exception. That exception seemed to restrict the freedom of choice of the  remaining 4% of all current employees. This class consisted of the President,  Vice President, high-level Executive Branch employees, Members of Congress, a  few other Legislative Branch employees, and all federal judges. See 42 U.S.C.   410(a)(5)(C)-(G); see also H. R. Rep. No. 98-25, p. 39 (1983); H. R. Conf. Rep.  No. 98-542, p. 13 (1983) (noting that for these current federal employees \"the  rules are being changed in the middle of the game\"). The new law seemed to  require this class of current federal employees to enter into the Social  Security program, see 42 U.S.C.  410(a)(5)(C)-(G). But, as to almost all of  these employees, the new law imposed no additional financial obligation or  burden.~    ~    ~      9~      That is because the new law then created an exception to the exception, see  Federal Employees' Retirement Contribution Temporary Adjustment Act of 1983,  203(a)(2), 208, 97 Stat. 1107, 1111 (codified at note following 5 U.S.C.   8331). The exception to the exception said that any member of this small class  of current high-level officials (4% of all then-current employees) who  contributed to a \"covered\" retirement program nonetheless could choose to modify  their participation in a manner that left their total payroll deduction-for  retirement and Social Security-unchanged. A \"covered\" employee paying 7% of  salary to a \"covered\" program could continue to pay that 7% and no more, in  effect avoiding any additional financial obligation as a result of joining  Social Security.~    ~    ~      10~      The exception to the exception defined a \"covered\" program to include the  Civil Service Retirement and Disability System-a program long available to  almost all federal employees-as well as any other retirement system to which an  employee must contribute. 203(a)(2)(A), (D). The definition of \"covered\"  program, however, did not encompass the pension system for federal judges-a  system that is noncontributory in respect to a judge (but contributory in  respect to a spouse).~    ~    ~      11~      The upshot is that the 1983 law was specifically aimed at extending Social  Security to federal employees. It left about 96% of those who were currently  employed free to choose not to participate in Social Security, thereby avoiding  any increased financial obligation. It required the remaining 4% to participate  in Social Security while freeing them of any added financial obligation (or  additional payroll deduction) so long as they previously had participated in  other contributory retirement programs. But it left those who could not  participate in a contributory program without a choice. Their financial  obligations (and payroll deductions) had to increase. And this last mentioned  group consisted almost exclusively of federal judges.~    ~    B~    ~      12~      This litigation began in 1989, when eight federal judges, all appointed  before 1983, sued the Government for \"compensation\" in the United States Claims  Court. They argued that the 1983 law, in requiring them to pay Social Security  taxes, violated the Compensation Clause. Initially, the Claims Court ruled  against the judges on jurisdictional grounds. 21 Cl. Ct. 786 (1990). The Court  of Appeals reversed. 953 F.2d 626 (CA Fed. 1992). On remand, eight more judges  joined the lawsuit. They contested the extension to judges of the Medicare tax  as well.~    ~    ~      13~      The Court of Federal Claims held against the judges on the merits. 31 Fed.  Cl. 436 (1994). The Federal Circuit reversed, ordering summary judgment for the  judges as to liability. 64 F.3d 647 (1995). The Government petitioned this Court  for writ of certiorari. Some Members of this Court were disqualified from  hearing the matter, and we failed to find a quorum of six Justices. See 28  U.S.C.  1. Consequently, the Court of Appeals' judgment was affirmed \"with the  same effect as upon affirmance by an equally divided court.\" 519 U.S. 801  (1996); see 28 U.S.C.  2109.~    ~    ~      14~      On remand from the Court of Appeals, the Court of Federal Claims found (a)  that the 6-year statute of limitations, see 28 U.S.C.  2401(a), 2501, barred  some claims, including all Medicare claims; and (b) that, in any event, a  subsequently enacted judicial salary increase promptly cured any violation,  making damages minimal. 38 Fed. Cl. 166 (1997). The Court of Appeals (eventually  en banc) reversed both determinations. 203 F.3d 795 (CA Fed. 2000).~    ~    ~      15~      The Government again petitioned for certiorari. It asked this Court to  consider two questions:~    ~    ~      16~      (1)    Whether Congress violated the Compensation Clause when it extended the  Medicare and Social Security taxes to the salaries of sitting federal judges;  and~    ~    ~      17~      (2)    If so, whether any such violation ended when Congress subsequently  increased the salaries of all federal judges by an amount greater than the new  taxes.~    ~    ~      18~      Given the specific statutory provisions at issue and the passage of time,  seven Members of this Court had (and now have) no financial stake in the outcome  of this case. Consequently a quorum was, and is, available to consider the  questions presented. And we granted the Government's petition for writ of  certiorari.~    ~    II~    ~      19~      At the outset, the judges claim that the \"law of the case\" doctrine prevents  us from now considering the first question presented, namely, the scope of the  Compensation Clause. They note that the Government presented that same question  in its petition from the Court of Appeals' earlier ruling on liability. They  point out that our earlier denial of that petition for lack of a quorum had the  \"same effect as\" an \"affirmance by an equally divided court,\" 28 U.S.C.  2109.  And they add that this Court has said that an affirmance by an equally divided  Court is \"conclusive and binding upon the parties as respects that controversy.\"  United States v. Pink, 315 U.S. 203, 216 (1942).~    ~    ~      20~      Pink, however, concerned a case, United States v. Moscow Fire Ins. Co., 309  U.S. 624 (1940), in which this Court had heard oral argument and apparently  considered the merits prior to concluding that affirmance by an equally divided  Court was appropriate. The law of the case doctrine presumes a hearing on the  merits. See, e.g., Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 347, n. 18 (1979). This case  does not involve a previous consideration of the merits. Indeed, when this case  previously was before us, due to absence of a quorum, we could not consider  either the merits or whether to consider those merits through grant of a writ of  certiorari. This fact, along with the obvious difficulty of finding other  equivalent substitute forums, convinces us that Pink's statement does not  control the outcome here, that the \"law of the case\" doctrine does not prevent  our considering both issues presented, and that we should now proceed to decide  them.~    ~    III~    ~      21~      The Court of Appeals upheld the judges' claim of tax immunity upon the  authority of Evans v. Gore, 253 U.S. 245 (1920). That case arose in 1919 when  Judge Walter Evans challenged Congress' authority to include sitting federal  judges within the scope of a federal income tax law that the Sixteenth Amendment  had authorized a few years earlier. See Revenue Act of 1918, 213, 40 Stat. 1065  (defining \"gross income\" to include judicial salaries). In Evans itself, the  Court held that the Compensation Clause barred application of the tax to Evans,  who had been appointed a judge before Congress enacted the tax. 253 U.S., at  264. A few years later the Court extended Evans, making clear that its rationale  covered not only judges appointed before Congress enacted a tax but also judges  whose appointments took place after the tax had become law. See Miles v. Graham,  268 U.S. 501, 509 (1925).~    ~    ~      22~      Fourteen years after deciding Miles, this Court overruled Miles. O'Malley v.  Woodrough, 307 U.S. 277 (1939). But, as the Court of Appeals noted, this Court  did not expressly overrule Evans itself. 64 F.3d, at 650. The Court of Appeals  added that, if \"changes in judicial doctrine\" had significantly undermined  Evans' holding, this \"Court itself would have overruled the case.\" Ibid. Noting  that this case is like Evans (involving judges appointed before enactment of the  tax), not like O'Malley (involving judges appointed after enactment of the tax),  the Court of Appeals held that Evans controlled the outcome. 64 F.3d, at 650.  Hence application of both Medicare and Social Security taxes to these  pre-enactment judges violated the Compensation Clause.~    ~    ~      23~      The Court of Appeals was correct in applying Evans to the instant case,  given that \"it is this Court's prerogative alone to overrule one of its  precedents.\" State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U.S. 3, 20 (1997); see also Rodriguez de  Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484 (1989).  Nonetheless, the court below, in effect, has invited us to reconsider Evans. We  now overrule Evans insofar as it holds that the Compensation Clause forbids  Congress to apply a generally applicable, nondiscriminatory tax to the salaries  of federal judges, whether or not they were appointed before enactment of the  tax.~    ~    ~      24~      The Court's opinion in Evans began by explaining why the Compensation Clause  is constitutionally important, and we begin by reaffirming that explanation. As  Evans points out, 253 U.S., at 251-252, the Compensation Clause, along with the  Clause securing federal judges appointments \"during good Behavior,\" U.S. Const.,  Art. III, 1-the practical equivalent of life tenure-helps to guarantee what  Alexander Hamilton called the \"complete independence of the courts of justice.\"  The Federalist No. 78, p. 466 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). Hamilton thought these  guarantees necessary because the Judiciary is \"beyond comparison the weakest of  the three\" branches of government. Id., at 465-466. It has \"no influence over  either the sword or the purse.\" Id., at 465. It has \"no direction either of the  strength or of the wealth of the society.\" Ibid. It has \"neither FORCE nor WILL  but merely judgment.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      25~      Hamilton's view, and that of many other Founders, was informed by firsthand  experience of the harmful consequences brought about when a King of England  \"made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and  the amount and payment of their salaries.\" The Declaration of Independence,   11. And Hamilton knew that \"a power over a man's subsistence amounts to a power  over his will.\" The Federalist No. 79, at 472. For this reason, he observed,  \"[n]ext to permanency in office, nothing can contribute more to the independence  of the judges than a fixed provision for their support.\" Ibid.; see also id.,  No. 48, at 310 (J. Madison) (\"[A]s the legislative department alone has access  to the pockets of the people, and has \" full discretion \" over the pecuniary  rewards of those who fill the other departments, a dependence is thus created in  the latter, which gives still greater facility to encroachments of the former\").~    ~    ~      26~      Evans properly added that these guarantees of compensation and life tenure  exist, \"not to benefit the judges,\" but \"as a limitation imposed in the public  interest.\" 253 U.S., at 253. They \"promote the public weal,\" id., at 248, in  part by helping to induce \"learned\" men and women \"to quit the lucrative  pursuits\" of the private sector, 1 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *294,  but more importantly by helping to secure an independence of mind and spirit  necessary if judges are \"to maintain that nice adjustment between individual  rights and governmental powers which constitutes political liberty,\" W. Wilson,  Constitutional Government in the United States 143 (1911).~    ~    ~      27~      Chief Justice John Marshall pointed out why this protection is important. A  judge may have to decide \"between the Government and the man whom that  Government is prosecuting: between the most powerful individual in the  community, and the poorest and most unpopular.\" Proceedings and Debates of the  Virginia State Convention, of 1829-1830, p. 616 (1830). A judge's decision may  affect an individual's \"property, his reputation, his life, his all.\" Ibid. In  the \"exercise of these duties,\" the judge must \"observe the utmost fairness.\"  Ibid. The judge must be \"perfectly and completely independent, with nothing to  influence or contro[l] him but God and his conscience.\" Ibid. The \"greatest  scourge . . . ever inflicted,\" Marshall thought, \"was an ignorant, a corrupt, or  a dependent Judiciary.\" Id., at 619.~    ~    ~      28~      Those who founded the Republic recognized the importance of these  constitutional principles. See, e.g., Wilson, Lectures on Law (1791), in 1 Works  of James Wilson 363 (J. Andrews ed. 1896); (stating that judges should be  \"completely independent\" in \"their salaries, and in their offices\"); McKean,  Debate in Pennsylvania Ratifying Convention, Dec. 11, 1787, in 2 Debates on the  Federal Constitution 539 (J. Elliot ed. 1836) (the security of undiminished  compensation disposes judges to be \"more easy and independent\"); see also 1  Kent, supra, at *294 (\"permanent support\" and the \"tenure of their office\" \"is  well calculated \" to give [judges] the requisite independence\"). They are no  less important today than in earlier times. And the fact that we overrule Evans  does not, in our view, diminish their importance.~    ~    ~      29~      We also agree with Evans insofar as it holds that the Compensation Clause  offers protections that extend beyond a legislative effort directly to diminish  a judge's pay, say by ordering a lower salary. 253 U.S., at 254. Otherwise a  legislature could circumvent even the most basic Compensation Clause protection  by enacting a discriminatory tax law, for example, that precisely but indirectly  achieved the forbidden effect.~    ~    ~      30~      Nonetheless, we disagree with Evans' application of Compensation Clause  principles to the matter before it-a nondiscriminatory tax that treated judges  the same way it treated other citizens. Evans' basic holding was that the  Compensation Clause forbids such a tax because the Clause forbids \"all  diminution,\" including \"taxation,\" \"whether for one purpose or another.\" Id., at  255. The Federal Circuit relied upon this holding. 64 F.3d, at 650. But, in our  view, it is no longer sound law.~    ~    ~      31~      For one thing, the dissenters in Evans cast the majority's reasoning into  doubt. Justice Holmes, joined by Justice Brandeis, wrote that the Compensation  Clause offers \"no reason for exonerating\" a judge \"from the ordinary duties of a  citizen, which he shares with all others. To require a man to pay the taxes that  all other men have to pay cannot possibly be made an instrument to attack his  independence as a judge.\" Evans, 253 U.S., at 265. Holmes analogized the  \"diminution\" that a tax might bring about to the burden that a state law might  impose upon interstate commerce. If \"there was no discrimination against such  commerce the tax constituted one of the ordinary burdens of government from  which parties were not exempted.\" Id., at 267.~    ~    ~      32~      For another thing, this Court's subsequent law repudiated Evans' reasoning.  In 1939, 14 years after Miles extended Evans' tax immunity to judges appointed  after enactment of the tax, this Court retreated from that extension. See  O'Malley, 307 U.S., at 283 (overruling Miles). And in so doing the Court, in an  opinion announced by Justice Frankfurter, adopted the reasoning of the Evans  dissent. The Court said that the question was whether judges are immune \"from  the incidences of taxation to which everyone else within the defined classes . .  . is subjected.\" Id., at 282. Holding that judges are not \"immun[e] from sharing  with their fellow citizens the material burden of the government,\" ibid., the  Court pointed out that the legal profession had criticized Evans' contrary  conclusion, and that courts outside the United States had resolved similar  matters differently, id., at 281. And the Court concluded that \"a  non-discriminatory tax laid generally on net income is not, when applied to the  income of a federal judge, a diminution of his salary within the prohibition of  Article III.\" Id., at 282. The Court conceded that Miles had reached the  opposite conclusion, but it said that Miles \"cannot survive.\" 307 U.S., at 283.  Still later, this Court noted that \"[b]ecause Miles relied on Evans v. Gore,  O'Malley must also be read to undermine the reasoning of Evans.\" United States  v. Will, 449 U.S. 200, 227, n. 31 (1980).~    ~    ~      33~      Finally, and most importantly, we believe that the reasoning of Justices  Holmes and Brandeis, and of this Court in O'Malley, is correct. There is no good  reason why a judge should not share the tax burdens borne by all citizens. We  concede that this Court has held that the Legislature cannot directly reduce  judicial salaries even as part of an equitable effort to reduce all Government  salaries. See 449 U.S., at 226. But a tax law, unlike a law mandating a salary  reduction, affects compensation indirectly, not directly. See ibid.  (distinguishing between measures that directly and those that indirectly  diminish judicial compensation). And those prophylactic considerations that may  justify an absolute rule forbidding direct salary reductions are absent here,  where indirect taxation is at issue. In practice, the likelihood that a  nondiscriminatory tax represents a disguised legislative effort to influence the  judicial will is virtually nonexistent. Hence the potential threats to judicial  independence that underlie the Constitution's compensation guarantee cannot  justify a special judicial exemption from a commonly shared tax, not even as a  preventive measure to counter those threats.~    ~    ~      34~      For these reasons, we hold that the Compensation Clause does not forbid  Congress to enact a law imposing a nondiscriminatory tax (including an increase  in rates or a change in conditions) upon judges, whether those judges were  appointed before or after the tax law in question was enacted or took effect.  Insofar as Evans holds to the contrary, that case, in O'Malley's words, \"cannot  survive.\" 307 U.S., at 283.~    ~    ~      35~      The Government points out that the Medicare tax is just such a  nondiscriminatory tax. Neither the courts below, nor the federal judges here,  argue to the contrary. Hence, insofar as the Court of Appeals found that  application of the Medicare tax law to federal judges is unconstitutional, we  reverse its decision.~    ~    IV~    ~      36~      The Social Security tax is a different matter. Respondents argue that the  1983 law imposing that tax upon then-sitting judges violates the Compensation  Clause, for it discriminates against judges in a manner forbidden by the Clause,  even as interpreted in O'Malley, not Evans. Cf. O'Malley, supra, at 282 (stating  question as whether judges are immune \"from the incidences of taxation to which  everyone else within the defined classes . . . is subjected\" (emphasis added)).  After examining the statute's details, we agree with the judges that it does  discriminate in a manner that the Clause forbids. Four features of the law,  taken together, lead us to this conclusion.~    ~    ~      37~      First, federal employees had remained outside the Social Security system for  nearly 50 years prior to the passage of the 1983 law. Congress enacted the law  pursuant to the Social Security Commission's recommendation to bring those  employees within the law. See supra, at 3. And the law itself deals primarily  with that subject. Thus, history, context, statutory purpose, and statutory  language, taken together, indicate that the category of \"federal employees\" is  the appropriate class against which we must measure the asserted discrimination.~    ~    ~      38~      Second, the law, as applied in practice, in effect imposed a new financial  obligation upon sitting judges, but it did not impose a new financial burden  upon any other group of (then) current federal employees. We have previously  explained why that is so. See supra, at 3-5. The law required all newly hired  federal employees to join Social Security and pay related taxes. It gave 96% of  all current employees (employed as of January 1, 1984 or earlier) total freedom  to enter, or not to enter, the system as they chose. It gave the remaining 4% of  all current employees the freedom to maintain their pre-1984 payroll deductions,  provided that they were currently enrolled in a \"covered\" system. And it defined  \"covered\" system in a way that included virtually all of that 4%, except for  federal judges. See supra, at 4-5. The practical upshot is that the law  permitted nearly every current federal employee, but not federal judges, to avoid the newly imposed financial obligation.~    ~    ~      39~      Third, the law, by including sitting judges in the system, adversely  affected most of them. Inclusion meant a requirement to pay a tax of about  $2,000 per year, deducted from a monthly salary check. App. 49. At the same  time, 95% of the then-active judges had already qualified for Social Security  (due to private sector employment) before becoming judges. See id., at 115. And  participation in Social Security as judges would benefit only a minority. See  id., at 116-119 (reviewing examples of individual judges and demonstrating that  participation in Social Security primarily would benefit the minority of judges  who had not worked the 40 quarters necessary to be fully insured). The new law  imposed a substantial cost on federal judges with little or no expectation of  substantial benefit for most of them.~    ~    ~      40~      Fourth, when measured against Compensation Clause objectives, the  Government's justification for the statutory distinction (between judges, who  do, and other federal employees, who do not, incur additional financial  obligations) is unsound. The sole justification, according to the Government, is  one of \"equaliz[ing]\" the retirement-related obligations that pre-1983 law  imposed upon judges with the retirement-related obligations that pre-1983 law  imposed upon other current high-level federal employees. Brief for United States  40. Thus the Government says that the new financial burden imposed upon judges  was meant to make up for the fact that the judicial retirement system is  basically a noncontributory system, while the system to which other federal  employees belonged was a contributory system. Id., at 39-40; Reply Brief for  United States 16.~    ~    ~      41~      This rationale, however, is the Government's and not necessarily that of  Congress, which was silent on the matter. Cf. Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of  United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 50  (1983) (expressing concern at crediting post hoc explanation of agency action).~    ~    ~      42~      More importantly, the judicial retirement system is noncontributory because  it reflects the fact that the Constitution itself guarantees federal judges life  tenure-thereby constitutionally permitting federal judges to draw a salary for  life simply by continuing to serve. Cf. Booth v. United States, 291 U.S. 339,  352 (1934) (holding that Compensation Clause protects salary of judge who has  retired). That fact means that a contributory system, in all likelihood, would  not work. And, of course, as of 1982, the noncontributory pension salary  benefits were themselves part of the judge's compensation. The 1983 statute  consequently singles out judges for adverse treatment solely because of a  feature required by the Constitution to preserve judicial independence. At the  same time, the \"equaliz[ation]\" in question takes place not by offering all  current federal employees (including judges) the same opportunities but by  employing a statutory disadvantage which offsets a constitutionally guaranteed  advantage. Hence, to accept the \"justification\" offered here is to permit,  through similar reasoning, taxes which have the effect of weakening or  eliminating those constitutional guarantees necessary to secure judicial  independence, at least insofar as similar guarantees are not enjoyed by others.  This point would be obvious were Congress, say, to deny some of the benefits of  a tax reduction to those with constitutionally guaranteed life tenure to make up  for the fact that other employees lack such tenure. Although the relationships  here-among advantages and disadvantages-are less distant and more complex, the  principle is similar.~    ~    ~      43~      Nor does the statute \"equaliz[e]\" with any precision. On the one hand, the  then-current retirement system open to all federal employees except judges  required a typical employee to contribute 7% to 8% of his or her annual salary.  See generally 5 U.S.C.  8334(a)(1). In return it provided a Member of Congress,  for instance, with a pension that vested after five years and increased in value  (by 2.5% of the Member's average salary) with each year of service to a maximum  of 80% of salary, and covered both employee and survivors. See 5 U.S.C.  8339  8341. On the other hand, the judges' retirement system (based on life tenure)  required no contribution for a judge who retired at age 65 (and who met certain  service requirements) to receive full salary. But the right to receive that  salary did not vest until retirement. The system provided nothing for a judge  who left office before age 65. Nor did the law provide any coverage for a  judge's survivors. Indeed, in 1984, a judge had to contribute 4.5% of annual  salary to obtain a survivor's annuity, which increased in value by 1.25% of the  judge's salary per year to a maximum of 40% of salary. 28 U.S.C.  376(b), (l)  (1982 ed.).~    ~    ~      44~      These two systems were not equal either before or after Congress enacted the  1983 law. Before 1983, a typical married federal employee other than a judge had  to contribute 7 to 8% of annual salary to receive benefits that were better in  some respects (vesting period, spousal benefit) and worse in some respects (80%  salary maximum) than his married judicial counterpart would receive in return  for a 4.5% contribution. The 1983 law imposed an added 5.7% burden upon the  judge, in return for which the typical judge received little, or no, financial  benefit. Viewed purely in financial equalization terms, and as applied to  typical judges, the new requirement seems to over-equalize, putting the typical married judge at a financial  disadvantage-though perhaps it would produce greater equality when applied to other, less typical examples.~    ~    ~      45~      Taken together, these four characteristics reveal a law that is special-in  its manner of singling out judges for disadvantageous treatment, in its  justification as necessary to offset advantages related to constitutionally  protected features of the judicial office, and in the degree of permissible  legislative discretion that would have to underlie any determination that the  legislation has \"equalized\" rather than gone too far. For these reasons the law  before us is very different from the \"non-discriminatory\" tax that O'Malley  upheld. 307 U.S., at 282. Were the Compensation Clause to permit Congress to  enact a discriminatory law with these features, it would authorize the  Legislature to diminish, or to equalize away, those very characteristics of the  Judicial Branch that Article III guarantees-characteristics which, as we have  said, see supra, at 9-10, the public needs to secure that judicial independence  upon which its rights depend. We consequently conclude that the 1983 Social  Security tax law discriminates against the Judicial Branch, in violation of the  Compensation Clause.~    ~    ~      46~      The Government makes additional arguments in support of reversal. But we  find them unconvincing. It suggests that Article III protects judges only  against a reduction in stated salary, not against indirect measures that only  reduce take-home pay. Brief for United States 28. In O'Malley, however, this  Court, when upholding a \"non-discriminatory\" tax, strongly implied that the  Compensation Clause would bar a discriminatory tax. 307 U.S., at 282. The  commentators whose work O'Malley cited said so explicitly. See Fellman, The  Diminution of Judicial Salaries, 24 Iowa L. Rev. 89, 99 (1938); see also Hall,  Case Comment, 20 Ill. L. Rev. 376, 377 (1925); Corwin, Constitutional Law in  1919-1920, 14 Am. Pol. Sci. Rev. 635, 642 (1920). And in Will, the Court yet  more strongly indicated that the Compensation Clause bars indirect efforts to  reduce judges' salaries through taxes when those taxes discriminate. 449 U.S.,  at 226. Indeed, the Government itself \"assume[s] that discriminatory taxation of  judges would contravene fundamental principles underlying Article III, if not  the [Compensation] Clause itself.\" Brief for United States 37, n. 27.~    ~    ~      47~      The Government also argues that there is no evidence here that Congress  singled out judges for special treatment in order to intimidate, influence, or  punish them. But this Court has never insisted upon such evidence. To require it  is to invite legislative efforts that embody, but lack evidence of, some such  intent, engendering suspicion among the branches and consequently undermining  that mutual respect that the Constitution demands. Cf. Wilson, Lectures on Law,  in 1 Works of James Wilson, at 364 (stating that judges \"should be removed from  the most distant apprehension of being affected, in their judicial character and  capacity, by anything, except their own behavior and its consequences\"). Nothing  in the record discloses anything other than benign congressional motives. If the  Compensation Clause is to offer meaningful protection, however, we cannot limit  that protection to instances in which the Legislature manifests, say, direct  hostility to the Judiciary.~    ~    ~      48~      Finally, the Government correctly points out that the law disfavored not  only judges but also the President of the United States and certain Legislative  Branch employees. As far as we can determine, however, all Legislative Branch  employees were free to join a covered system, and the record provides us with no  example of any current Legislative Branch employee who had failed to do so. See  Tr. of Oral Arg. 16-17, 37-38. The President's pension is noncontributory. See  note following 3 U.S.C.  102. And the President himself, like the judges, is  protected against diminution in his \"[c]ompensation.\" See U.S. Const., Art. II,  1. These facts may help establish congressional good faith. But, as we have  said, we do not doubt that good faith. And we do not see why, otherwise, the  separate and special example of that single individual, the President, should  make a critical difference here.~    ~    ~      49~      We conclude that, insofar as the 1983 statute required then-sitting judges  to join the Social Security System and pay Social Security taxes, that statute  violates the Compensation Clause.~    ~    V~    ~      50~      The second question presented is whether the  \"constitutional violation ended when Congress increased the statutory salaries  of federal judges by an amount greater than the amount [of the Social Security]  taxes deducted from respondents' judicial salaries.\" Pet. for Cert. (I).~    ~    ~      51~      The Government argues for an affirmative answer. It points to a statutory  salary increase that all judges received in 1984. It says that this increase,  subsequent to the imposition of Social Security taxes on judges' salaries, cured  any earlier unconstitutional diminution of salaries in a lesser amount.  Otherwise, if \"Congress improperly reduced judges salaries from $140,000\" per  year \"to $130,000\" per year, the judges would be able to collect the amount of  the improper reduction, here $10,000, forever-even if Congress cured the  improper reduction by raising salaries $20,000, to $150,000, a year later. Reply  Brief for United States 18. To avoid this consequence, the Government argues, we  should simply look to the fact of a later salary increase \"whether or not one of  Congress's purposes in increasing the salaries\" was \"to terminate the  constitutional violation.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      52~      But how could we always decide whether a later salary increase terminates a  constitutional violation without examining the purpose of that increase? Imagine  a violation that affected only a few. To accept the Government's position would  leave those few at a permanent salary disadvantage. If, for example, Congress  reduced the salaries of one group of judges by 20%, a later increase of 30%  applicable to all judges would leave the first group permanently 20% behind. And  a pay cut that left those judges at a permanent disadvantage would perpetuate  the very harm that the Compensation Clause seeks to prevent.~    ~    ~      53~      The Court of Appeals consequently examined the context in which the later  pay increases took place in order to determine their relation to the earlier  Compensation Clause violation. It found \"nothing to suggest\" that the later  salary increase at issue here sought \"to make whole the losses sustained by the  pre-1983 judges.\" 185 F.3d, at 1362-1363. The Government presents no evidence to  the contrary.~    ~    ~      54~      The relevant economic circumstances surrounding the 1984, and subsequent,  salary increases include inflation sufficiently serious to erode the real value  of judicial salaries and salary increases insufficient to maintain real salaries  or real compensation parity with many other private-sector employees. See Report  of 1989 Commission on Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Salaries, Hearings  before the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, 101st Cong., 1st Sess.,  12-13 (1989) (testimony of Lloyd Cutler regarding effect of inflation on judges'  salaries since 1969). For instance, while consumer prices rose 363% between 1969  and 1999, salaries in the private sector rose 421%, and salaries for district  judges rose 253%. See American Bar Association, Federal Judicial Pay Erosion 11  (Feb. 2001). These figures strongly suggest that the judicial salary increases  simply reflected a congressional effort to restore both to judges and to Members  of Congress themselves some, but not all, of the real compensation that  inflation had eroded. Those salary increases amounted to a congressional effort  to adjust judicial salaries to reflect \"fluctuations in the value of money,\" The  Federalist No. 79, at 473 (A. Hamilton)-the kind of adjustment that the Founders  believed \"may be requisite,\" McKean, Debate in Pennsylvania Ratifying  Convention, Dec. 11, 1787, in 2 Debates on the Federal Constitution, at 539; see  also Rosenn, The Constitutional Guaranty Against Diminution of Judicial  Compensation, 24 UCLA L. Rev. 308, 314-315 (1976).~    ~    ~      55~      We have found nothing to the contrary. And we therefore agree with the Court  of Appeals' similar conclusion. 185 F.3d, at 1363 (\"[E]verything in the record\"  suggests that the increase was meant to halt \"the slide in purchasing power resulting from continued and unadjusted-for inflation\").~    ~    ~      56~      The Government says that a circumstance-specific approach may prove  difficult to administer. Brief for United States 43. And we concede that  examining the circumstances in order to determine whether there is or is not a  relation between an earlier violation and a later increase is more complex than  the Government's proposed automatic approach. But we see no reason why such  relief as damages or an exemption from Social Security would prove unworkable.~    ~    ~      57~      Finally, the Government looks to our decision in Will for support. In that  case, federal judges challenged the constitutionality of certain legislative  \"freezes\" that Congress had imposed upon earlier enacted Government-wide  cost-of-living salary adjustments. The Court found a Compensation Clause  violation in respect to the freeze for what was designated Year One (where  Congress had rescinded an earlier-voted 4.8% salary increase). Will, 449 U.S.,  at 225-226. The Government points out that the Will Court \"noted that Congress,  later in that fiscal year, enacted a statutory increase in judges' salaries that  exceeded the salaries that judges would have received\" without the rescission.  Brief for United States 41. And the Government adds that \"it was unquestioned in  Will\" that the judges could not receive damages for the time subsequent to this  later enactment. Id., at 41-42.~    ~    ~      58~      The Will Year One example, however, shows only that, in the circumstances,  and unlike the case before us, the later salary increase was related to the  earlier salary diminishment. Regardless, the very fact that the matter was  \"unquestioned\" in Will shows that it was not argued. See 449 U.S., at 206, n. 3  (noting that the judges' complaint sought relief for Year One's diminution only  up to the moment of the subsequent salary increase). Hence the Court did not  decide the matter now before us.~    ~    ~      59~      We conclude that later statutory salary increases did not cure the preceding  unconstitutional harm.~    ~    VI~    ~      60~      Insofar as the Court of Appeals found the application of Medicare taxes to  the salaries of judges taking office before 1983 unconstitutional, its judgment  is reversed. Insofar as that court found the application of Social Security  taxes to the salaries of judges taking office before 1984 unconstitutional, its  judgment is affirmed. We also affirm the Court of Appeals' determination that  the 1984 salary increase received by federal judges did not cure the  Compensation Clause violation. The case is remanded for further proceedings  consistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      61~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      62~      Justice Stevens and Justice O'Connor took no part in the consideration or  decision of this case.             Scalia, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.~    ~    ~      63~      Thomas, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.~    ~    ~      64~      Stevens, J., and O'Connor, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.~    ~    ~      65~      Justice Scalia, concurring in part and dissenting in part.~    ~    ~      66~      I agree with the Court that extending the Social Security tax to sitting  Article III judges in 1984 violated Article III's Compensation Clause. I part  paths with the Court on the issue of extending the Medicare tax to federal  judges in 1983, which I think was also unconstitutional.1~    ~    ~      67~      * As an initial matter, I think the Court is right in concluding that Evans v.  Gore, 253 U.S. 245 (1920)-holding that new taxes of general applicability cannot  be applied to sitting Article III judges-is no longer good law, and should be  overruled. We went out of our way in O'Malley v. Woodrough, 307 U.S. 277,  280-281 (1939), to catalog criticism of Evans, and subsequently recognized, in  United States v. Will, 449 U.S. 200, 227, and n. 31 (1980), that O'Malley had  \"undermine[d] the reasoning of Evans.\" The Court's decision today simply  recognizes what should be obvious: that Evans has not only been undermined, but  has in fact collapsed.~    ~    II~    ~      68~      My disagreement with the Court arises from its focus upon the issue of  discrimination, which turns out to be dispositive with respect to the Medicare  tax. The Court holds \"that the Compensation Clause does not forbid Congress to  enact a law imposing a nondiscriminatory tax . . . upon judges, whether those  judges were appointed before or after the tax law in question was enacted or  took effect.\" Ante, at 12. Since \"the Medicare tax is just such a  nondiscriminatory tax,\" the Court concludes that \"application of [that] tax law  to federal judges is [c]onstitutional.\" Ante, at 12-13.~    ~    ~      69~      But we are dealing here with a \"Compensation Clause,\" not a \"Discrimination  Clause.\" See U.S. Const., Art III, 1 (\"The Judges . . . shall, at stated Times,  receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during  their Continuance in Office\"). As we have said, \"the Constitution makes no  exceptions for 'nondiscriminatory' reductions\" in judicial compensation, Will,  supra, at 226. A reduction in compensation is a reduction in compensation, even  if all federal employees are subjected to the same cut. The discrimination  criterion that the Court uses would make sense if the only purpose of the  Compensation Clause were to prevent invidious (and possibly coercive) action  against judges. But as the Court acknowledges, the Clause \" 'promote[s] the  public weal' . . . by helping to induce 'learned' men and women to 'quit the  lucrative pursuits' of the private sector,\" ante, at 9 (quoting Evans, supra, at  248; 1 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *294). That inducement would not  exist if Congress could cut judicial salaries so long as it did not do so  discriminatorily.~    ~    ~      70~      What the question comes down to, then, is (1) whether exemption from a  certain tax can constitute part of a judge's \"compensation,\" and (2) if so,  whether exemption from the Medicare tax was part of the judges' compensation  here. The answer to the more general question seems to me obviously yes. Surely  the term \"compensation\" refers to the entire \"package\" of benefits-not just  cash, but retirement benefits, medical care, and exemption from taxation if that  is part of the employment package. It is simply unreasonable to think that  \"$150,000 a year tax-free\" (if that was the bargain struck) is not higher  compensation that \"$150,000 a year subject to taxes.\" Ask the employees of the  World Bank.~    ~    ~      71~      The more difficult question-though far from an insoluble one-is when an exemption from tax constitutes compensation. In most  cases, the presence or absence of taxation upon wages, like the presence or  absence of many other factors within the control of government-inflation, for  example, or the rates charged by government-owned utilities, or import duties  that increase consumer prices-affects the value of compensation, but is not an  element of compensation itself. The Framers had this distinction well in mind.  Hamilton, for example, wrote that as a result of \"the fluctuations in the value  of money,\" \"[i]t was . . . necessary to leave it to the discretion of the  legislature to vary its provisions\" for judicial compensation. The Federalist  No. 79, p. 473 (C. Rossiter, ed. 1961); see also Will, supra, at 227 (the  Constitution \"placed faith in the integrity and sound judgment of the elected  representatives to enact increases\" in judicial salaries to account for  inflation). Since Hamilton thought that the Compensation Clause \"put it out of  the power of [Congress] to change the condition of the individual [judge] for  the worse,\" The Federalist No. 79, at 473, he obviously believed that inflation  does not diminish compensation as that term is used in the Constitution.~    ~    ~      72~      This distinction between Government action affecting compensation and Government action affecting the value of compensation was the basis for our  statement in O'Malley, 307 U.S., at 282, that \"[t]o subject [judges] to a  general tax is merely to recognize that judges are also citizens, and that their  particular function in government does not generate an immunity from sharing with their fellow citizens the  material burden of the government \" .\" I agree with the Court, therefore, that  Evans was wrongly decided-not, however, because in Evans there was no  discrimination, but because in Evans the universal application of the tax  demonstrated that the Government was not reducing the compensation of its judges  but was acting as sovereign rather than employer, imposing a general tax.~    ~    ~      73~      But just as it is clear that a federal employee's sharing of a tax-free status that all citizens enjoy is not compensation (and elimination of that  tax-free status not a reduction in compensation), so also it is clear that a  tax-free status conditioned on federal employment is compensation, and its  elimination a reduction. The Court apparently acknowledges that if a tax is  imposed on the basis of federal employment (an income tax, for example, payable  only by federal judges) it would constitute a reduction in compensation. It is  impossible to understand why a tax that is suspended on the basis of federal  employment (an exemption from federal income tax for federal judges) does not  constitute the conferral of compensation-in which case its elimination is a  reduction, whether or not federal judges end up being taxed just like other  citizens. Only converting the Compensation Clause into a Discrimination Clause  can explain a contrary conclusion.~    ~    ~      74~      And this, of course, is what has been achieved by the targeted extension of  the Medicare tax to federal employees who were previously exempt. It may well be  that, in some abstract sense, they are not being \"discriminated against,\" since  they end up being taxed like other citizens; but this does not alter the fact  that, since exemption from the tax was part of their employment package-since  they had an employment expectation of a preferential exemption from  taxation-their compensation was being reduced. One of the benefits of being a  federal judge (or any federal employee) had, prior to 1982, been an exemption  from the Medicare tax. This benefit Congress took away, much as a private  employer might terminate a contractual commitment to pay Medicare taxes on  behalf of its employees. The latter would clearly be a cut in compensation, and  so is the former.2 Had Congress simply imposed the Medicare tax on its own  employees (including judges) at the time it introduced that tax for other  working people, no benefit of federal employment would have been reduced,  because, with respect to the newly introduced tax, none had ever existed. But an  extension to federal employees of a tax from which they had previously been  exempt by reason of their employment status seems to me a flat-out reduction of  federal employment compensation.~    ~    III~    ~      75~      As should be clear from the above, though I agree with the Court that the  extension of the Social Security tax to federal judges runs afoul of the  Compensation Clause, I disagree with the Court's grounding of this holding on  the discriminatory manner in which the extension occurred. In this part of its  opinion, however, the Court's antidiscrimination rationale is slightly different  from that which appeared in its discussion of the Medicare tax. There, the focus  was on discrimination compared with ordinary citizens; here, the focus is on  discrimination vis-a-vis other federal employees. (As the Court explains,  federal judges, unlike nearly all other federal employees, were not given the  opportunity to opt out of paying the tax). On my analysis, it would not matter  if every federal employee had been made subject to the Social Security tax along  with judges, so long as one of the previous entitlements of their federal  employment had been exemption from that tax. Federal judges, unlike all other  federal employees except the President, see Art. II, 1, cl. 7, cannot,  consistent with the Constitution, have their compensation diminished. If this  case involved salary cuts to pay for Social Security, rather than taxes to pay  for Social Security, the irrelevance of whether other federal employees were  covered by the operative legislation would be clear.~    ~    ~      76~      * * *~    ~    ~      77~      I join in the judgment that extension of the Social Security tax to sitting  Article III judges was unconstitutional. I would affirm the Federal Circuit's  holding that extension of the Medicare tax was unconstitutional as well.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~          I agree with the Court, see Part II, ante, that the law-of-the-case doctrine  does not bar our consideration of the merits. I also join the Court in holding,  see Part V, ante, that any constitutional violation was not remedied by  subsequent salary increases.~      ~      ~        2~         As the Court explains, the purpose of the Medicare tax extension was to  ensure that federal workers \"bear a more equitable share of the costs of  financing the benefits to which many of them eventually became entitled\" by  reason of their own or their spouses' private-sector employment. Ante, at 2  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As with the Social Security  tax, therefore, the Medicare tax aspect of this case does not present the  situation in which a tax exemption has been eliminated in return for some other  benefit, different in kind but equivalent in value. Cf. ante, at 14  (\"[P]articipation in Social Security as judges would benefit only a minority\").~      ~    ~    ~      78~      Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.~    ~    ~      79~      I believe this Court was correct in Evans v. Gore, 253 U.S. 245 (1920), when it held that any tax that reduces a judge's net compensation violates Article  III of the Constitution. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court  of Appeals in its entirety.~    ~    ",

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.The Wharf (HOLDINGS) LIMITED, et al., PETITIONERSv.UNITED INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS, INC. et al.~    No. 00-347.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued March 21, 2001~    Decided May 21, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      Petitioner The Wharf (Holdings) Limited orally granted respondent United International Holdings, Inc., an option to buy 10% of the stock in Wharf's Hong Kong cable system if United rendered certain services, but internal Wharf documents suggested that Wharf never intended to carry out its promise. United fulfilled its obligation, but Wharf refused to permit it to exercise the option. United sued in Federal District Court, claiming that Wharf's conduct violated, inter alia, 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which prohibits using \"any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance\" \"in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.\" 15 U.S.C.  78j(b). A jury found for United, and the Tenth Circuit affirmed.~      Held: Wharf's secret intent not to honor the option it sold United violates 10(b). Pp. 4-9.~      (a) The Court must assume that the \"security\" at issue is not the cable system stock, but the option to purchase that stock, because Wharf conceded this point below. That concession is consistent with the Act's language defining \"security\" to include both \"any . . . option . . . on any security\" and \"any . . . right to . . . purchase\" stock. 78c(a)(10). P. 5.~      (b) Wharf's claim that 10(b) does not cover oral contracts of sale is rejected. This Court held in Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S. 723, that the Act does not protect a person who did not actually buy securities, but who might have done so had the seller told the truth. But United is not a potential buyer; by providing Wharf with its services, it actually bought the option that Wharf sold. And Blue Chip Stamps did not suggest that oral purchases or sales fall outside the Act's scope. Neither is there any other convincing reason to interpret the Act to exclude oral contracts as a class. The Act itself says that it applies to \"any contract\" for a security's purchase or sale, 78c(a)(13), (14), and oral contracts for the sale of securities are sufficiently common that the Uniform Commercial Code and statutes of frauds in every State consider them enforceable. Pp. 5-7.~      (c) Also rejected is Wharf's argument that a secret reservation not to permit the exercise of an option falls outside 10(b) because it does not relate to the value of a security purchase or the consideration paid, and hence does not implicate 10(b)'s full disclosure policy. Even were it the case that the Act covers only misrepresentations likely to affect the value of securities, Wharf's secret reservation was such a misrepresentation. To sell an option while secretly intending not to permit the option's exercise is misleading, because a buyer normally presumes good faith. Similarly, the secret reservation misled United about the option's value, which was, unbeknownst to United, valueless. Pp. 7-8.~      (d) Finally, the Court rejects Wharf's claim that interpreting the Act to allow recovery in a case like this one will permit numerous plaintiffs to bring federal securities claims that are in reality no more than ordinary state breach-of-contract claims lying outside the Act's basic objectives. United's claim is not simply that Wharf failed to carry out a promise to sell it securities, but that Wharf sold it a security (the option) while secretly intending from the very beginning not to honor the option. Moreover, Wharf has not shown that its concern has proved serious as a practical matter in the past or that it is likely to prove serious in the future. Pp. 8-9. 210 F.3d 1207, affirmed.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT~      Breyer, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      This securities fraud action focuses upon a company that sold an option to buy stock while secretly intending never to honor the option. The question before us is whether this conduct violates 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which prohibits using \"any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance\" \"in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.\" 48 Stat. 891, 15 U.S.C.  78j(b); see also 17 CFR  240.10b-5 (2000). We conclude that it does.~    ~    ~      2~      * Respondent United International Holdings, Inc., a Colorado-based company, sued petitioner The Wharf (Holdings) Limited, a Hong Kong firm, in Colorado's Federal District Court. United said that in October 1992 Wharf had sold it an option to buy 10% of the stock of a new Hong Kong cable system. But, United alleged, at the time of the sale Wharf secretly intended not to permit United to exercise the option. United claimed that Wharf's conduct amounted to a fraud \"in connection with the . . . sale of [a] security,\" prohibited by 10(b), and violated numerous state laws as well. A jury found in United's favor. The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit upheld that verdict. 210 F.3d 1207 (2000). And we granted certiorari to consider whether the dispute fell within the scope of 10(b).~    ~    ~      3~      The relevant facts, viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict winner, United, are as follows. In 1991, the Hong Kong government announced that it would accept bids for the award of an exclusive license to operate a cable television system in Hong Kong. Wharf decided to prepare a bid. Wharf's chairman, Peter Woo, instructed one of its managing directors, Stephen Ng, to find a business partner with cable system experience. Ng found United. And United sent several employees to Hong Kong to help prepare Wharf's application, negotiate contracts, design the system, and arrange financing.~    ~    ~      4~      United asked to be paid for its services with a right to invest in the cable system if Wharf should obtain the license. During August and September 1992, while United's employees were at work helping Wharf, Wharf and United negotiated about the details of that payment. Wharf prepared a draft letter of intent that contemplated giving United the right to become a co-investor, owning 10% of the system. But the parties did not sign the letter of intent. And in September, when Wharf submitted its bid, it told the Hong Kong authorities that Wharf would be the system's initial sole owner, Lodging to App. AY-4, although Wharf would also \"consider\" allowing United to become an investor, id., at AY-6.~    ~    ~      5~      In early October 1992, Ng met with a United representative, who told Ng that United would continue to help only if Wharf gave United an enforceable right to invest. Ng then orally granted United an option with the following terms: (1) United had the right to buy 10% of the future system's stock; (2) the price of exercising the option would be 10% of the system's capital requirements minus the value of United's previous services (including expenses); (3) United could exercise the option only if it showed that it could fund its 10% share of the capital required for at least the first 18 months; and (4) the option would expire if not exercised within six months of the date that Wharf received the license. The parties continued to negotiate about how to write documents that would embody these terms, but they never reduced the agreement to writing.~    ~    ~      6~      In May 1993, Hong Kong awarded the cable franchise to Wharf. United raised $66 million designed to help finance its 10% share. In July or August 1993, United told Wharf that it was ready to exercise its option. But Wharf refused to permit United to buy any of the system's stock. Contemporaneous internal Wharf documents suggested that Wharf had never intended to carry out its promise. For example, a few weeks before the key October 1992 meeting, Ng had prepared a memorandum stating that United wanted a right to invest that it could exercise if it was able to raise the necessary capital. A handwritten note by Wharf's Chairman Woo replied, \"No, no, no, we don't accept that.\" App. DT-187; Lodging to App. AI-1. In September 1993, after meeting with the Wharf board to discuss United's investment in the cable system, Ng wrote to another Wharf executive, \"How do we get out?\" Id., at CY-1. In December 1993, after United had filed documents with the Securities Exchange Commission representing that United was negotiating the acquisition of a 10% interest in the cable system, an internal Wharf memo stated that \"[o]ur next move should be to claim that our directors got quite upset over these representations . . . . Publicly, we do not acknowledge [United's] opportunity\" to acquire the 10% interest. Id., at DF-1 (emphasis in original). In the margin of a December 1993 letter from United discussing its expectation of investing in the cable system, Ng wrote, \"[B]e careful, must deflect this! [H]ow?\" Id., at DI-1. Other Wharf documents referred to the need to \"back ped[al],\" id., at DG-1, and \"stall,\" id., at DJ-1.~    ~    ~      7~      These documents, along with other evidence, convinced the jury that Wharf, through Ng, had orally sold United an option to purchase a 10% interest in the future cable system while secretly intending not to permit United to exercise the option, in violation of 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and various state laws. The jury awarded United compensatory damages of $67 million and, in light of \"circumstances of fraud, malice, or willful and wanton conduct,\" App. EM-18, punitive damages of $58.5 million on the state-law claims. As we have said, the Court of Appeals upheld the jury's award. 210 F.3d 1207 (CA10 2000). And we granted certiorari to determine whether Wharf's oral sale of an option it intended not to honor is prohibited by 10(b).~    ~    II~    ~      8~      Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act makes it \"unlawful for any person . . . [t]o use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security . . ., any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the [SEC] may prescribe.\" 15 U.S.C.  78j.~    ~    ~      9~      Pursuant to this provision, the SEC has promulgated Rule 10b-5. That Rule forbids the use, \"in connection with the purchase or sale of any security,\" of (1) \"any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud\"; (2) \"any untrue statement of a material fact\"; (3) the omission of \"a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made . . . not misleading\"; or (4) any other \"act, practice, or course of business\" that \"operates . . . as a fraud or deceit.\" 17 CFR 240.10b-5 (2000).~    ~    ~      10~      To succeed in a Rule 10b-5 suit, a private plaintiff must show that the defendant used, in connection with the purchase or sale of a security, one of the four kinds of manipulative or deceptive devices to which the Rule refers, and must also satisfy certain other requirements not at issue here. See, e.g., 15 U.S.C.  78j (requiring the \"use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce or of the mails, or of any facility of any national securities exchange\"); Ernst  Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 193 (1976) (requiring scienter, meaning \"intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud\"); Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 231-232 (1988) (requiring that any misrepresentation be material); id., at 243 (requiring that the plaintiff sustain damages through reliance on the misrepresentation).~    ~    ~      11~      In deciding whether the Rule covers the circumstances present here, we must assume that the \"security\" at issue is not the cable system stock, but the option to purchase that stock. That is because the Court of Appeals found that Wharf conceded this point. 210 F.3d, at 1221 (\"Wharf does not contest on appeal the classification of the option as a security\"). That concession is consistent with the language of the Securities Exchange Act, which defines \"security\" to include both \"any ... option . . . on any security\" and \"any . . . right to ... purchase\" stock. 15 U.S.C.  78c(a)(10) (1994 ed., Supp. V); see also Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S. 723, 751 (1975) (\"holders of . . . options, and other contractual rights or duties to purchase . . . securities\" are \" 'purchasers' . . . of securities for purposes of Rule 10b-5\"). And Wharf's current effort to deny the concession, by pointing to an ambiguous statement in its Court of Appeals reply brief, comes too late and is unconvincing. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 16, n. 8 (citing Reply Brief for Appellants in Nos. 97-1421, 98-1002 (CA10), pp. 5-6). Consequently, we must decide whether Wharf's secret intent not to honor the option it sold United amounted to a misrepresentation (or other conduct forbidden by the Rule) in connection with the sale of the option.~    ~    ~      12~      Wharf argues that its conduct falls outside the Rule's scope for two basic reasons. First, Wharf points out that its agreement to grant United an option to purchase shares in the cable system was an oral agreement. And it says that 10(b) does not cover oral contracts of sale. Wharf points to Blue Chip Stamps, in which this Court construed the Act's \"purchase or sale\" language to mean that only \"actual purchasers and sellers of securities\" have standing to bring a private action for damages. See 421 U.S., at 730-731. Wharf notes that the Court's interpretation of the Act flowed in part from the need to protect defendants against lawsuits that \"turn largely on which oral version of a series of occurrences the jury may decide to credit.\" Blue Chip Stamps, supra, at 742. And it claims that an oral purchase or sale would pose a similar problem of proof and thus should not satisfy the Rule's \"purchase or sale\" requirement.~    ~    ~      13~      Blue Chip Stamps, however, involved the very different question whether the Act protects a person who did not actually buy securities, but who might have done so had the seller told the truth. The Court held that the Act does not cover such a potential buyer, in part for the reason that Wharf states. But United is not a potential buyer; by providing Wharf with its services, it actually bought the option that Wharf sold. And Blue Chip Stamps said nothing to suggest that oral purchases or sales fall outside the scope of the Act. Rather, the Court's concern was about \"the abuse potential and proof problems inherent in suits by investors who neither bought nor sold, but asserted they would have traded absent fraudulent conduct by others.\" United States v. O'Hagan, 521 U.S. 642, 664 (1997). Such a \"potential purchase\" claim would rest on facts, including the plaintiff's state of mind, that might be \"totally unknown and unknowable to the defendant,\" depriving the jury of \"the benefit of weighing the plaintiff's version against the defendant's version.\" Blue Chip Stamps, supra, at 746. An actual sale, even if oral, would not create this problem, because both parties would be able to testify as to whether the relevant events had occurred.~    ~    ~      14~      Neither is there any other convincing reason to interpret the Act to exclude oral contracts as a class. The Act itself says that it applies to \"any contract\" for the purchase or sale of a security. 15 U.S.C.  78c(a)(13), (14). Oral contracts for the sale of securities are sufficiently common that the Uniform Commercial Code and statutes of frauds in every State now consider them enforceable. See U. C. C. 8-113 (Supp. 2000) (\"A contract . . . for the sale or purchase of a security is enforceable whether or not there is a writing signed or record authenticated by a party against whom enforcement is sought\"); see also 2C U. L. A. 77-81 (Supp. 2000) (table of enactments of U. C. C. Revised Art. 8 (amended 1994)) (noting adoption of 8-113, with minor variations, by all States except Rhode Island and South Carolina); R. I. Gen. Laws 6A-8-322 (1999) (repealed effective July 1, 2001) (making oral contracts for the sale of securities enforceable); 6A-8-113 (2000 Cum. Supp.) (effective July 1, 2001) (same); S. C. Code Ann. 36-8-113 (Supp. 2000) (same); U. C. C. 8-113 Comment (Supp. 2000) (\"[T]he statute of frauds is unsuited to the realities of the securities business\"). Any exception for oral sales of securities would significantly limit the Act's coverage, thereby undermining its basic purposes.~    ~    ~      15~      Wharf makes a related but narrower argument that the Act does not encompass oral contracts of sale that are unenforceable under state law. But we do not reach that issue. The Court of Appeals held that Wharf's sale of the option was not covered by the then-applicable Colorado statute of frauds, Colo. Rev. Stat. 4-8-319 (repealed 1996), and hence was enforceable under state law. Though Wharf disputes the correctness of that holding, we ordinarily will not consider such a state-law issue, and we decline to do so here.~    ~    ~      16~      Second, Wharf argues that a secret reservation not to permit the exercise of an option falls outside 10(b) because it does not \"relat[e] to the value of a security purchase or the consideration paid\"; hence it does \"not implicate [10(b)'s] policy of full disclosure.\" Brief for Petitioners 25, 26 (emphasis deleted). But even were it the case that the Act covers only misrepresentations likely to affect the value of securities, Wharf's secret reservation was such a misrepresentation. To sell an option while secretly intending not to permit the option's exercise is misleading, because a buyer normally presumes good faith. Cf., e.g., Restatement (Second) of Torts 530, Comment c (1976) (\"Since a promise necessarily carries with it the implied assertion of an intention to perform[,] it follows that a promise made without such an intention is fraudulent\"). For similar reasons, the secret reservation misled United about the option's value. Since Wharf did not intend to honor the option, the option was, unbeknownst to United, valueless.~    ~    ~      17~      Finally, Wharf supports its claim for an exemption from the statute by characterizing this case as a \"disput[e] over the ownership of securities.\" Brief for Petitioners 24. Wharf expresses concern that interpreting the Act to allow recovery in a case like this one will permit numerous plaintiffs to bring federal securities claims that are in reality no more than ordinary state breach-of-contract claims-actions that lie outside the Act's basic objectives. United's claim, however, is not simply that Wharf failed to carry out a promise to sell it securities. It is a claim that Wharf sold it a security (the option) while secretly intending from the very beginning not to honor the option. And United proved that secret intent with documentary evidence that went well beyond evidence of a simple failure to perform. Moreover, Wharf has not shown us that its concern has proven serious as a practical matter in the past. Cf. Threadgill v.

After receiving orders to close its facilities, Buckhannon and others (hereinafter petitioners) brought suit in Federal District Court against the State and state agencies and officials (hereinafter respondents), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief that the \"self-preservation\" requirement violated the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (FHAA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). Respondents agreed to stay the orders pending the case's resolution. The state legislature then eliminated the \"self-preservation\" requirement, and the District Court granted respondents' motion to dismiss the case as moot. Petitioners requested attorney's fees as the \"prevailing party\" under the FHAA and ADA, basing their entitlement on the \"catalyst theory,\" which posits that a plaintiff is a \"prevailing party\" if it achieves the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant's conduct. As the Fourth Circuit had previously rejected the \"catalyst theory,\" the District Court denied the motion, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed.~      Held: The \"catalyst theory\" is not a permissible basis for the award of attorney's fees under the FHAA and ADA. Under the \"American Rule,\" parties are ordinarily required to bear their own attorney's fees, and courts follow a general practice of not awarding fees to a prevailing party absent explicit statutory authority, Key Tronic Corp. v. United States, 511 U.S. 809, 819. Congress has employed the legal term of art \"prevailing party\" in numerous statutes authorizing awards of attorney's fees. A \"prevailing party\" is one who has been awarded some relief by a court. See, e.g., Hanrahan v. Hampton, 446 U.S. 754, 758. Both judgments on the merits and court-ordered consent decrees create a material alteration of the parties' legal relationship and thus permit an award. The \"catalyst theory,\" however, allows an award where there is no judicially sanctioned change in the parties' legal relationship. A defendant's voluntary change in conduct, although perhaps accomplishing what the plaintiff sought to achieve by the lawsuit, lacks the necessary judicial imprimatur on the change. The legislative history cited by petitioners is at best ambiguous as to the availability of the \"catalyst theory\"; and, particularly in view of the \"American Rule,\" such history is clearly insufficient to alter the clear meaning of \"prevailing party\" in the fee-shifting statutes. Given this meaning, this Court need not determine which way petitioners' various policy arguments cut. Pp. 3-12.~      203 F.3d 819, affirmed.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT~      Rehnquist, C. J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ., joined.~      Opinion of the Court~      Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      Numerous federal statutes allow courts to award attorney's fees and costs to the \"prevailing party.\" The question presented here is whether this term includes a party that has failed to secure a judgment on the merits or a court-ordered consent decree, but has nonetheless achieved the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant's conduct. We hold that it does not.~    ~    ~      2~      Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc., which operates care homes that provide assisted living to their residents, failed an inspection by the West Virginia Office of the State Fire Marshal because some of the residents were incapable of \"self-preservation\" as defined under state law. See W. Va. Code 16-5H-1, 16-5H-2 (1998) (requiring that all residents of residential board and care homes be capable of \"self-preservation,\" or capable of moving themselves \"from situations involving imminent danger, such as fire\"); W. Va. Code of State Rules, tit. 87, ser. 1, 14.07(1) (1995) (same). On October 28, 1997, after receiving cease and desist orders requiring the closure of its residential care facilities within 30 days, Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc., on behalf of itself and other similarly situated homes and residents (hereinafter petitioners), brought suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia against the State of West Virginia, two of its agencies, and 18 individuals (hereinafter respondents), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief1 that the \"self-preservation\" requirement violated the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (FHAA), 102 Stat. 1619, 42 U.S.C.  3601 et seq., and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 104 Stat. 327, 42 U.S.C.  12101 et seq.~    ~    ~      3~      Respondents agreed to stay enforcement of the cease and desist orders pending resolution of the case and the parties began discovery. In 1998, the West Virginia Legislature enacted two bills eliminating the \"self-preservation\" requirement, see H. R. 4200, I 1998 W. Va. Acts 983-986 (amending regulations); S. 627, II 1998 W. Va. Acts 1198-1199 (amending statute), and respondents moved to dismiss the case as moot. The District Court granted the motion, finding that the 1998 legislation had eliminated the allegedly offensive provisions and that there was no indication that the West Virginia Legislature would repeal the amendments.2~    ~    ~      4~      Petitioners requested attorney's fees as the \"prevailing party\" under the FHAA, 42 U.S.C.  3613(c)(2) (\"[T]he court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party ... a reasonable attorney's fee and costs\"), and ADA, 42 U.S.C.  12205 (\"[T]he court ... , in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party ... a reasonable attorney's fee, including litigation expenses, and costs\"). Petitioners argued that they were entitled to attorney's fees under the \"catalyst theory,\" which posits that a plaintiff is a \"prevailing party\" if it achieves the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant's conduct. Although most Courts of Appeals recognize the \"catalyst theory,\"3 the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit rejected it in S-1 and S-2 v. State Bd. of Ed. of N. C., 21 F.3d 49, 51 (1994) (en banc) (\"A person may not be a 'prevailing party' ... except by virtue of having obtained an enforceable judgment, consent decree, or settlement giving some of the legal relief sought\"). The District Court accordingly denied the motion and, for the same reason, the Court of Appeals affirmed in an unpublished, per curiam opinion. Judgt. order reported at 203 F.3d 819 (CA4 2000).~    ~    ~      5~      To resolve the disagreement amongst the Courts of Appeals, we granted certiorari, 530 U.S. 1304 (2000), and now affirm.~    ~    ~      6~      In the United States, parties are ordinarily required to bear their own attorney's fees-the prevailing party is not entitled to collect from the loser. See Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U.S. 240, 247 (1975). Under this \"American Rule,\" we follow \"a general practice of not awarding fees to a prevailing party absent explicit statutory authority.\" Key Tronic Corp. v. United States, 511 U.S. 809, 819 (1994). Congress, however, has authorized the award of attorney's fees to the \"prevailing party\" in numerous statutes in addition to those at issue here, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 259, 42 U.S.C.  2000e-5(k), the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1975, 89 Stat. 402, 42 U.S.C.  1973l(e), and the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 90 Stat. 2641, 42 U.S.C.  1988. See generally Marek v. Chesny, 473 U.S. 1, 43-51 (1985) (Appendix to opinion of Brennan, J., dissenting).4~    ~    ~      7~      In designating those parties eligible for an award of litigation costs, Congress employed the term \"prevailing party,\" a legal term of art. Black's Law Dictionary 1145 (7th ed. 1999) defines \"prevailing party\" as \"[a] party in whose favor a judgment is rendered, regardless of the amount of damages awarded . - Also termed successful party.\" This view that a \"prevailing party\" is one who has been awarded some relief by the court can be distilled from our prior cases.5~    ~    ~      8~      In Hanrahan v. Hampton, 446 U.S. 754, 758 (1980) (per curiam), we reviewed the legislative history of 1988 and found that \"Congress intended to permit the interim award of counsel fees only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims.\" Our \"[r]espect for ordinary language requires that a plaintiff receive at least some relief on the merits of his claim before he can be said to prevail.\" Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U.S. 755, 760 (1987). We have held that even an award of nominal damages suffices under this test. See Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103 (1992).6~    ~    ~      9~      In addition to judgments on the merits, we have held that settlement agreements enforced through a consent decree may serve as the basis for an award of attorney's fees. See Maher v. Gagne, 448 U.S. 122 (1980). Although a consent decree does not always include an admission of liability by the defendant, see, e.g., id., at 126, n. 8, it nonetheless is a court-ordered \"chang[e] [in] the legal relationship between [the plaintiff] and the defendant.\" Texas State Teachers Assn. v. Garland Independent School Dist., 489 U.S. 782, 792 (1989) (citing Hewitt, supra, at 760-761, and Rhodes v. Stewart, 488 U.S. 1, 3-4 (1988) (per curiam)).7 These decisions, taken together, establish that enforceable judgments on the merits and court-ordered consent decrees create the \"material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties\" necessary to permit an award of attorney's fees. 489 U.S., at 792-793; see also Hanrahan, supra, at 757 (\"[I]t seems clearly to have been the intent of Congress to permit . . . an interlocutory award only to a party who has established his entitlement to some relief on the merits of his claims, either in the trial court or on appeal\" (emphasis added)).~    ~    ~      10~      We think, however, the \"catalyst theory\" falls on the other side of the line from these examples. It allows an award where there is no judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties. Even under a limited form of the \"catalyst theory,\" a plaintiff could recover attorney's fees if it established that the \"complaint had sufficient merit to withstand a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction or failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted.\" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 27. This is not the type of legal merit that our prior decisions, based upon plain language and congressional intent, have found necessary. Indeed, we held in Hewitt that an interlocutory ruling that reverses a dismissal for failure to state a claim \"is not the stuff of which legal victories are made.\" 482 U.S., at 760. See also Hanrahan, supra, at 754 (reversal of a directed verdict for defendant does not make plaintiff a \"prevailing party\"). A defendant's voluntary change in conduct, although perhaps accomplishing what the plaintiff sought to achieve by the lawsuit, lacks the necessary judicial imprimatur on the change. Our precedents thus counsel against holding that the term \"prevailing party\" authorizes an award of attorney's fees without a corresponding alteration in the legal relationship of the parties.~    ~    ~      11~      The dissenters chide us for upsetting \"long-prevailing Circuit precedent.\" Post, at 1 (emphasis added). But, as Justice Scalia points out in his concurrence, several Courts of Appeals have relied upon dicta in our prior cases in approving the \"catalyst theory.\" See post, at 11-12; see also supra, at 4-5, n. 5. Now that the issue is squarely presented, it behooves us to reconcile the plain language of the statutes with our prior holdings. We have only awarded attorney's fees where the plaintiff has received a judgment on the merits, see, e.g., Farrar, supra, at 112, or obtained a court-ordered consent decree, Maher, supra, at 129-130-we have not awarded attorney's fees where the plaintiff has secured the reversal of a directed verdict, see Hanrahan, supra, at 759, or acquired a judicial pronouncement that the defendant has violated the Constitution unaccompanied by \"judicial relief,\" Hewitt, supra, at 760 (emphasis added). Never have we awarded attorney's fees for a nonjudicial \"alteration of actual circumstances.\" Post, at 13. While urging an expansion of our precedents on this front, the dissenters would simultaneously abrogate the \"merit\" requirement of our prior cases and award attorney's fees where the plaintiff's claim \"was at least colorable\" and \"not . . . groundless.\" Post, at 7 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We cannot agree that the term \"prevailing party\" authorizes federal courts to award attorney's fees to a plaintiff who, by simply filing a nonfrivolous but nonetheless potentially meritless lawsuit (it will never be determined), has reached the \"sought-after destination\" without obtaining any judicial relief. Post, at 13 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).8~    ~    ~      12~      Petitioners nonetheless argue that the legislative history of the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act supports a broad reading of \"prevailing party\" which includes the \"catalyst theory.\" We doubt that legislative history could overcome what we think is the rather clear meaning of \"prevailing party\"-the term actually used in the statute. Since we resorted to such history in Garland, 489 U.S., at 790, Maher, 448 U.S., at 129, and Hanrahan, 446 U.S., at 756-757, however, we do likewise here.~    ~    ~      13~      The House Report to 1988 states that \"[t]he phrase 'prevailing party' is not intended to be limited to the victor only after entry of a final judgment following a full trial on the merits, \" H. R. Rep. No. 94-1558, p. 7 (1976), while the Senate Report explains that \"parties may be considered to have prevailed when they vindicate rights through a consent judgment or without formally obtaining relief,\" S. Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 5 (1976). Petitioners argue that these Reports and their reference to a 1970 decision from the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, Parham v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., 433 F.2d 421 (1970), indicate Congress' intent to adopt the \"catalyst theory.\"9 We think the legislative history cited by petitioners is at best ambiguous as to the availability of the \"catalyst theory\" for awarding attorney's fees. Particularly in view of the \"American Rule\" that attorney's fees will not be awarded absent \"explicit statutory authority,\" such legislative history is clearly insufficient to alter the accepted meaning of the statutory term. Key Tronic, 511 U.S., at 819; see also Hanrahan, supra, at 758 (\"[O]nly when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims ... has there been a determination of the 'substantial rights of the parties,' which Congress determined was a necessary foundation for departing from the usual rule in this country that each party is to bear the expense of his own attorney\" (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 94-1558, at 8)).~    ~    ~      14~      Petitioners finally assert that the \"catalyst theory\" is necessary to prevent defendants from unilaterally mooting an action before judgment in an effort to avoid an award of attorney's fees. They also claim that the rejection of the \"catalyst theory\" will deter plaintiffs with meritorious but expensive cases from bringing suit. We are skeptical of these assertions, which are entirely speculative and unsupported by any empirical evidence (e.g., whether the number of suits brought in the Fourth Circuit has declined, in relation to other Circuits, since the decision in S-1 and S-2).~    ~    ~      15~      Petitioners discount the disincentive that the \"catalyst theory\" may have upon a defendant's decision to voluntarily change its conduct, conduct that may not be illegal. \"The defendants' potential liability for fees in this kind of litigation can be as significant as, and sometimes even more significant than, their potential liability on the merits,\" Evans v. Jeff D., 475 U.S. 717, 734 (1986), and the possibility of being assessed attorney's fees may well deter a defendant from altering its conduct.~    ~    ~      16~      And petitioners' fear of mischievous defendants only materializes in claims for equitable relief, for so long as the plaintiff has a cause of action for damages, a defendant's change in conduct will not moot the case.10 Even then, it is not clear how often courts will find a case mooted: \"It is well settled that a defendant's voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice\" unless it is \"absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.\" Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). If a case is not found to be moot, and the plaintiff later procures an enforceable judgment, the court may of course award attorney's fees. Given this possibility, a defendant has a strong incentive to enter a settlement agreement, where it can negotiate attorney's fees and costs. Cf. Marek v. Chesny, 473 U.S., at 7 (\"[M]any a defendant would be unwilling to make a binding settlement offer on terms that left it exposed to liability for attorney's fees in whatever amount the court might fix on motion of the plaintiff\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).~    ~    ~      17~      We have also stated that \"[a] request for attorney's fees should not result in a second major litigation,\" Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 437 (1983), and have accordingly avoided an interpretation of the fee-shifting statutes that would have \"spawn[ed] a second litigation of significant dimension,\" Garland, 489 U.S., at 791. Among other things, a \"catalyst theory\" hearing would require analysis of the defendant's subjective motivations in changing its conduct, an analysis that \"will likely depend on a highly factbound inquiry and may turn on reasonable inferences from the nature and timing of the defendant's change in conduct.\" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 28. Although we do not doubt the ability of district courts to perform the nuanced \"three thresholds\" test required by the \"catalyst theory\"-whether the claim was colorable rather than groundless; whether the lawsuit was a substantial rather than an insubstantial cause of the defendant's change in conduct; whether the defendant's change in conduct was motivated by the plaintiff's threat of victory rather than threat of expense, see post, at 6-7-it is clearly not a formula for \"ready administrability.\" Burlington v. Dague, 505 U.S. 557, 566 (1992).~    ~    ~      18~      Given the clear meaning of \"prevailing party\" in the fee-shifting statutes, we need not determine which way these various policy arguments cut. In Alyeska, 421 U.S., at 260, we said that Congress had not \"extended any roving authority to the Judiciary to allow counsel fees as costs or otherwise whenever the courts might deem them warranted.\" To disregard the clear legislative language and the holdings of our prior cases on the basis of such policy arguments would be a similar assumption of a \"roving authority.\" For the reasons stated above, we hold that the \"catalyst theory\" is not a permissible basis for the award of attorney's fees under the FHAA, 42 U.S.C.  3613(c)(2), and ADA, 42 U.S.C.  12205.~    ~    ~      19~      The judgment of the Court of Appeals is Affirmed.~    ~    ~      20~      Scalia, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Thomas, J., joined.~    ~    ~      21~      Ginsburg, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Stevens, Souter, and Breyer, JJ., joined.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         The original complaint also sought money damages, but petitioners relinquished this claim on January 2, 1998.

West Palm Beach, 194 F.3d 1203, 1207 (CA11 1999).~      ~      ~        4~         We have interpreted these fee-shifting provisions consistently, see Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433, n. 7 (1983), and so approach the nearly identical provisions at issue here.~      ~      ~        5~         We have never had occasion to decide whether the term \"prevailing party\" allows an award of fees under the \"catalyst theory\" described above. Dicta in Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U.S. 755, 760 (1987), alluded to the possibility of attorney's fees where \"voluntary action by the defendant ... affords the plaintiff all or some of the relief ... sought,\" but we expressly reserved the question, see id., at 763 (\"We need not decide the circumstances, if any, under which this 'catalyst' theory could justify a fee award\"). And though the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit relied upon our decision in Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103 (1992), in rejecting the \"catalyst theory,\" Farrar \"involved no catalytic effect.\" Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 194 (2000). Thus, there is language in our cases supporting both petitioners and respondents, and last Term we observed that it was an open question here. See ibid.~      ~      ~        6~         However, in some circumstances such a \"prevailing party\" should still not receive an award of attorney's fees. See Farrar v. Hobby, supra, at 115-116.~      ~      ~        7~         We have subsequently characterized the Maher opinion as also allowing for an award of attorney's fees for private settlements. See Farrar v. Hobby, supra, at 111; Hewitt v. Helms, supra, at 760. But this dicta ignores that Maher only \"held that fees may be assessed ... after a case has been settled by the entry of a consent decree.\" Evans v. Jeff D., 475 U.S. 717, 720 (1986). Private settlements do not entail the judicial approval and oversight involved in consent decrees. And federal jurisdiction to enforce a private contractual settlement will often be lacking unless the terms of the agreement are incorporated into the order of dismissal. See Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, 511 U.S. 375 (1994).~      ~      ~        8~         Although the dissenters seek support from Mansfield, C.  L. M. R. Co. v. Swan, 111 U.S. 379 (1884), that case involved costs, not attorney's fees. \"[B]y the long established practice and universally recognized rule of the common law . . . the prevailing party is entitled to recover a judgment for costs,\" id., at 387, but \"the rule 'has long been that attorney's fees are not ordinarily recoverable,' \" Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U.S. 240, 257 (1975) (quoting Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co., 386 U.S. 714, 717 (1967)). Courts generally, and this Court in particular, then and now, have a presumptive rule for costs which the Court in its discretion may vary. See, e.g., this Court's Rule 43.2 (\"If the Court reverses or vacates a judgment, the respondent or appellee shall pay costs unless the Court otherwise orders\"). In Mansfield, the defendants had successfully removed the case to federal court, successfully opposed the plaintiffs' motion to remand the case to state court, lost on the merits of the case, and then reversed course and successfully argued in this Court that the lower federal court had no jurisdiction. The Court awarded costs to the plaintiffs, even though they had lost and the defendants won on the jurisdictional issue, which was the only question this Court decided. In no ordinary sense of the word can the plaintiffs have been said to be the prevailing party here-they lost and their opponents won on the only litigated issue-so the Court's use of the term must be regarded as a figurative rather than a literal one, justifying the departure from the presumptive rule allowing costs to the prevailing party because of the obvious equities favoring the plaintiffs. The Court employed its discretion to recognize that the plaintiffs had been the victims of the defendants' legally successful whipsawing tactics.~      ~      ~        9~         Although the Court of Appeals in Parham awarded attorney's fees to the plaintiff because his \"lawsuit acted as a catalyst which prompted the [defendant] to take action ... seeking compliance with the requirements of Title VII,\" 433 F.2d, at 429-430, it did so only after finding that the defendant had acted unlawfully, see id., at 426 (\"We hold as a matter of law that [plaintiff's evidence] established a violation of Title VII\"). Thus, consistent with our holding in Farrar, Parham stands for the proposition that an enforceable judgment permits an award of attorney's fees. And like the consent decree in Maher v. Gagne, 448 U.S. 122 (1980), the Court of Appeals in Parham ordered the District Court to \"retain jurisdiction over the matter for a reasonable period of time to insure the continued implementation of the appellee's policy of equal employment opportunities.\" 433 F.2d, at 429. Clearly Parham does not support a theory of fee shifting untethered to a material alteration in the legal relationship of the parties as defined by our precedents.~      ~      ~        10~         Only States and state officers acting in their official capacity are immune from suits for damages in federal court. See, e.g., Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651 (1974). Plaintiffs may bring suit for damages against all others, including municipalities and other political subdivisions of a State, see Mt.

Doyle, 429 U.S. 274 (1977).~      ~    ~    Scalia, J., concurring~    ~      22~      I join the opinion of the Court in its entirety, and write to respond at greater length to the contentions of the dissent.~    ~    ~      23~      * \"Prevailing party\" is not some newfangled legal term invented for use in late-20th-century fee-shifting statutes. \"[B]y the long established practice and universally recognized rule of the common law, in actions at law, the prevailing party is entitled to recover a judgment for costs ... .\" Mansfield, C.  L. M. R. Co. v. Swan, 111 U.S. 379, 387 (1884).~    ~    ~      24~      \"Costs have usually been allowed to the prevailing party, as incident to the judgment, since the statute 6 Edw. I, c. 1, 2, and the same rule was acknowledged in the courts of the States, at the time the judicial system of the United States was organized. . . .~    ~    ~      25~      \"Weighed in the light of these several provisions in the Judiciary Act [of 1789], the conclusion appears to be clear that Congress intended to allow costs to the prevailing party, as incident to the judgment . . . .\" The Baltimore, 8 Wall. 377, 388, 390 (1869).~    ~    ~      26~      The term has been found within the United States Statutes at Large since at least the Bankruptcy Act of 1867, which provided that \"[t]he party prevailing in the suit shall be entitled to costs against the adverse party.\" Act of Mar. 2, 1867, ch. 176, 24, 14 Stat. 528. See also Act of Mar. 3, 1887, ch. 359, 15, 24 Stat. 508 (\"If the Government of the United States shall put in issue the right of the plaintiff to recover the court may, in its discretion, allow costs to the prevailing party from the time of joining such issue\"). A computer search shows that the term \"prevailing party\" appears at least 70 times in the current United States Code; it is no stranger to the law.~    ~    ~      27~      At the time 42 U.S.C.  1988 was enacted, I know of no case, state or federal, in which-either under a statutory invocation of \"prevailing party,\" or under the common-law rule-the \"catalyst theory\" was enunciated as the basis for awarding costs. Indeed, the dissent cites only one case in which (although the \"catalyst theory\" was not expressed) costs were awarded for a reason that the catalyst theory would support, but today's holding of the Court would not: Baldwin v. Chesapeake  Potomac Tel. Co., 156 Md. 552, 557, 144 A. 703, 705 (1929), where costs were awarded because \"the granting of [appellee's] motion to dismiss the appeal has made it unnecessary to inquire into the merits of the suit, and the dismissal is based on an act of appellee performed after both the institution of the suit and the entry of the appeal.\" And that case is irrelevant to the meaning of \"prevailing party,\" because it was a case in equity. While, as Mansfield observed, costs were awarded in actions at law to the \"prevailing party,\" see 111 U.S., at 387, an equity court could award costs \"as the equities of the case might require,\" Getz v. Johnston, 145 Md. 426, 433, 125 A. 689, 691 (1924). See also Horn v. Bohn, 96 Md. 8, 12-13, 53 A. 576, 577 (1902) (\"The question of costs in equity cases is a matter resting in the sound discretion of the Court, from the exercise of which no appeal will lie\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).1 The other state or state-law cases the dissent cites as awarding costs despite the absence of a judgment all involve a judicial finding-or its equivalent, an acknowledgement by the defendant-of the merits of plaintiff's case.2 Moreover, the dissent cites not a single case in which this Court-or even any other federal court applying federal law prior to enactment of the fee-shifting statutes at issue here-has regarded as the \"prevailing party\" a litigant who left the courthouse emptyhanded. If the term means what the dissent contends, that is a remarkable absence of authority.~    ~    ~      28~      That a judicial finding of liability was an understood requirement of \"prevailing\" is confirmed by many statutes that use the phrase in a context that presumes the existence of a judicial ruling. See, e.g., 5 U.S.C.  1221(g)(2) (\"[i]f an employee . . . is the prevailing party . . . and the decision is based on a finding of a prohibited personnel practice\"); 1221(g)(3) (providing for an award of attorney's fees to the \"prevailing party,\" \"regardless of the basis of the decision\"); 7701(b)(2)(A) (allowing the prevailing party to obtain an interlocutory award of the \"relief provided in the decision\"); 8 U.S.C.  1324b(h) (permitting the administrative law judge to award an attorney's fee to the prevailing party \"if the losing party's argument is without reasonable foundation in law and fact\"); 18 U.S.C.  1864(e) (1994 ed., Supp. V) (allowing the district court to award the prevailing party its attorney's fee \"in addition to monetary damages\").~    ~    ~      29~      The dissent points out, post, at 8-9, that the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 limits attorney's fees to an amount \" 'proportionately related to the court ordered relief for the violation.' \" This shows that sometimes Congress does explicitly \"tightly bind fees to judgments,\" post, at 8, inviting (the dissent believes) the conclusion that \"prevailing party\" does not fasten fees to judgments. That conclusion does not follow from the premise. What this statutory provision demonstrates, at most, is that use of the phrase \"prevailing party\" is not the only way to impose a requirement of court-ordered relief. That is assuredly true. But it would be no more rational to reject the normal meaning of \"prevailing party\" because some statutes produce the same result with different language, than it would be to conclude that, since there are many synonyms for the word \"jump,\" the word \"jump\" must mean something else.~    ~    ~      30~      It is undoubtedly true, as the dissent points out by quoting a nonlegal dictionary, see post, at 12-13, that the word \"prevailing\" can have other meanings in other contexts: \"prevailing winds\" are the winds that predominate, and the \"prevailing party\" in an election is the party that wins the election. But when \"prevailing party\" is used by courts or legislatures in the context of a lawsuit, it is a term of art. It has traditionally-and to my knowledge, prior to enactment of the first of the statutes at issue here, invariably-meant the party that wins the suit or obtains a finding (or an admission) of liability. Not the party that ultimately gets his way because his adversary dies before the suit comes to judgment; not the party that gets his way because circumstances so change that a victory on the legal point for the other side turns out to be a practical victory for him; and not the party that gets his way because the other side ceases (for whatever reason) its offensive conduct. If a nuisance suit is mooted because the defendant asphalt plant has gone bankrupt and ceased operations, one would not normally call the plaintiff the prevailing party. And it would make no difference, as far as the propriety of that characterization is concerned, if the plant did not go bankrupt but moved to a new location to avoid the expense of litigation. In one sense the plaintiff would have \"prevailed\"; but he would not be the prevailing party in the lawsuit. Words that have acquired a specialized meaning in the legal context must be accorded their legal meaning.~    ~    ~      31~      \"[W]here Congress borrows terms of art in which are accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of centuries of practice, it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in the body of learning from which it was taken and the meaning its use will convey to the judicial mind unless otherwise instructed. In such case, absence of contrary direction may be taken as satisfaction with widely accepted definitions, not as a departure from them.\" Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 263 (1952).~    ~    ~      32~      The cases cited by the dissent in which we have \"not treated Black's Law Dictionary as preclusively definitive,\" post, at 8, are inapposite. In both Pioneer Investment Services Co. v. Brunswick Associates Ltd. Partnership, 507 U.S. 380 (1993), and United States v. Rodgers, 466 U.S. 475 (1984), we rejected Black's definition because it conflicted with our precedent. See Pioneer, supra, at 395-396 n. 14; Rodgers, supra, at 480. We did not, as the dissent would do here, simply reject a relevant definition of a word tailored to judicial settings in favor of a more general definition from another dictionary.~    ~    II~    ~      33~      The dissent distorts the term \"prevailing party\" beyond its normal meaning for policy reasons, but even those seem to me misguided. They rest upon the presumption that the catalyst theory applies when \"the suit's merit led the defendant to abandon the fray, to switch rather than fight on, to accord plaintiff sooner rather than later the principal redress sought in the complaint,\" post, at 1 (emphasis added). As the dissent would have it, by giving the term its normal meaning the Court today approves the practice of denying attorney's fees to a plaintiff with a proven claim of discrimination, simply because the very merit of his claim led the defendant to capitulate before judgment. That is not the case. To the contrary, the Court approves the result in Parham v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 433 F.2d 421 (CA8 1970), where attorney's fees were awarded \"after [a] finding that the defendant had acted unlawfully,\" ante, at 9, and n. 9.3 What the dissent's stretching of the term produces is something more, and something far less reasonable: an award of attorney's fees when the merits of plaintiff's case remain unresolved-when, for all one knows, the defendant only \"abandon[ed] the fray\" because the cost of litigation-either financial or in terms of public relations-would be too great. In such a case, the plaintiff may have \"prevailed\" as Webster's defines that term-\"gain[ed] victory by virtue of strength or superiority,\" see post, at 12. But I doubt it was greater strength in financial resources, or superiority in media manipulation, rather than superiority in legal merit, that Congress intended to reward.~    ~    ~      34~      It could be argued, perhaps, that insofar as abstract justice is concerned, there is little to choose between the dissent's outcome and the Court's: If the former sometimes rewards the plaintiff with a phony claim (there is no way of knowing), the latter sometimes denies fees to the plaintiff with a solid case whose adversary slinks away on the eve of judgment. But it seems to me the evil of the former far outweighs the evil of the latter. There is all the difference in the world between a rule that denies the extraordinary boon of attorney's fees to some plaintiffs who are no less \"deserving\" of them than others who receive them, and a rule that causes the law to be the very instrument of wrong-exacting the payment of attorney's fees to the extortionist.~    ~    ~      35~      It is true that monetary settlements and consent decrees can be extorted as well, and we have approved the award of attorney's fees in cases resolved through such mechanisms. See ante, at 5-6 (citing cases). Our decision that the statute makes plaintiff a \"prevailing party\" under such circumstances was based entirely on language in a House Report, see Maher v. Gagne, 448 U.S. 122, 129 (1980), and if this issue were to arise for the first time today, I doubt whether I would agree with that result. See Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U.S. 755, 760 (1987) (Scalia, J.) (opining that \"[r]espect for ordinary language requires that a plaintiff receive at least some relief on the merits of his claim before he can be said to prevail\" (emphasis added)). But in the case of court-approved settlements and consent decrees, even if there has been no judicial determination of the merits, the outcome is at least the product of, and bears the sanction of, judicial action in the lawsuit. There is at least some basis for saying that the party favored by the settlement or decree prevailed in the suit. Extending the holding of Maher to a case in which no judicial action whatever has been taken stretches the term \"prevailing party\" (and the potential injustice that Maher produces) beyond what the normal meaning of that term in the litigation context can conceivably support.~    ~    ~      36~      The dissent points out that petitioners' object in bringing their suit was not to obtain \"a judge's approbation,\" but to \"stop enforcement of a [West Virginia] rule,\" post, at 13; see also Hewitt, supra, at 761. True enough. But not even the dissent claims that if a petitioner accumulated attorney's fees in preparing a threatened complaint, but never filed it prior to the defendant's voluntary cessation of its offending behavior, the wannabe-but-never-was plaintiff could recover fees; that would be countertextual, since the fee-shifting statutes require that there be an \"action\" or \"proceeding,\" see 42 U.S.C.  3613(d); 1988(b) (1994 ed., Supp. V)-which in legal parlance (though not in more general usage) means a lawsuit. See post, at 23 (concluding that a party should be deemed prevailing as a result of a \"postcomplaint payment or change in conduct\"). Does that not leave achievement of the broad congressional purpose identified by the dissent just as unsatisfactorily incomplete as the failure to award fees when there is no decree? Just as the dissent rhetorically asks why (never mind the language of the statute) Congress would want to award fees when there is a judgment, but deny fees when the defendant capitulates on the eve of judgment; so also it is fair for us to ask why Congress would want to award fees when suit has been filed, but deny fees when the about-to-be defendant capitulates under the threat of filing. Surely, it cannot be because determination of whether suit was actually contemplated and threatened is too difficult. All the proof takes is a threatening letter and a batch of timesheets. Surely that obstacle would not deter the Congress that (according to the dissent) was willing to let district judges pursue that much more evasive will-o'-the-wisp called \"catalyst.\" (Is this not why we have district courts?, asks the dissent, post, at 19.) My point is not that it would take no more twisting of language to produce prelitigation attorney's fees than to produce the decreeless attorney's fees that the dissent favors (though that may well be true). My point is that the departure from normal usage that the dissent favors cannot be justified on the ground that it establishes a regime of logical even handedness. There must be a cutoff of seemingly equivalent entitlements to fees-either the failure to file suit in time or the failure to obtain a judgment in time. The term \"prevailing party\" suggests the latter rather than the former. One does not prevail in a suit that is never determined.~    ~    ~      37~      The dissent's ultimate worry is that today's opinion will \"impede access to court for the less well-heeled,\" post, at 1. But, of course, the catalyst theory also harms the \"less well-heeled,\" putting pressure on them to avoid the risk of massive fees by abandoning a solidly defensible case early in litigation. Since the fee-shifting statutes at issue here allow defendants as well as plaintiffs to receive a fee award, we know that Congress did not intend to maximize the quantity of \"the enforcement of federal law by private attorneys general,\" ibid. Rather, Congress desired an appropriate level of enforcement-which is more likely to be produced by limiting fee awards to plaintiffs who prevail \"on the merits,\" or at least to those who achieve an enforceable \"alteration of the legal relationship of the parties,\" than by permitting the open-ended inquiry approved by the dissent.4~    ~    III~    ~      38~      The dissent points out that the catalyst theory has been accepted by \"the clear majority of Federal Circuits,\" post, at 2. But our disagreeing with a \"clear majority\" of the Circuits is not at all a rare phenomenon. Indeed, our opinions sometimes contradict the unanimous and long-standing interpretation of lower federal courts. See, e.g., McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350, 365 (1987) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (the Court's decision contradicted \"[e]very court to consider\" the question).~    ~    ~      39~      The dissent's insistence that we defer to the \"clear majority\" of Circuit opinion is particularly peculiar in the present case, since that majority has been nurtured and preserved by our own misleading dicta (to which I, unfortunately, contributed). Most of the Circuit Court cases cited by the dissent, post, at 6, and n. 5, as reaffirming the catalyst theory after our decision in Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103 (1992), relied on our earlier opinion in Hewitt. See Marbley v. Bane, 57 F.3d 224, 234 (CA2 1995) (relying on Hewitt to support catalyst theory); Payne v. Board of Ed., 88 F.3d 392, 397 (CA6 1996) (same); Baumgartner v. Harrisburg Housing Auth., 21 F.3d 541, 548 (CA3 1994) (explicitly rejecting Farrar in favor of Hewitt); Zinn v. Shalala, 35 F.3d 273, 274-276 (CA7 1994) (same); Beard v. Teska, 31 F.3d 942, 950-952 (CA10 1994) (same); Morris v. West Palm Beach, 194 F.3d 1203, 1207 (CA11 1999) (same). Deferring to our colleagues' own error is bad enough; but enshrining the error that we ourselves have improvidently suggested and blaming it on the near-unanimous judgment of our colleagues would surely be unworthy.5 Informing the Courts of Appeals that our ill-considered dicta have misled them displays, it seems to me, not \"disrespect,\" but a most becoming (and well-deserved) humility.~    ~    ~      40~      * * *~    ~    ~      41~      The Court today concludes that a party cannot be deemed to have prevailed, for purposes of fee-shifting statutes such as 42 U.S.C.  1988 3613(c)(2), unless there has been an enforceable \"alteration of the legal relationship of the parties.\" That is the normal meaning of \"prevailing party\" in litigation, and there is no proper basis for departing from that normal meaning. Congress is free, of course, to revise these provisions-but it is my guess that if it does so it will not create the sort of inequity that the catalyst theory invites, but will require the court to determine that there was at least a substantial likelihood that the party requesting fees would have prevailed.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         The jurisdiction that issued Baldwin has used the phrase \"prevailing party\" frequently (including in equity cases) to mean the party acquiring a judgment. See Getz v. Johnston, 145 Md. 426, 434, 125 A. 689, 691-692 (1924) (an equity decision noting that \" [O]n reversal, following the usual rule, the costs will generally go to the prevailing party, that is, to the appellant\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). See also, e.g., Hoffman v. Glock, 20 Md. App. 284, 293, 315 A. 2d 551, 557 (1974) (\"Md. Rule 604a provides: 'Unless otherwise provided by law, or ordered by the court, the prevailing party shall be entitled to the allowance of court costs, which shall be taxed by the clerk and embraced in the judgment' \"); Fritts v. Fritts, 11 Md. App. 195, 197, 273 A. 2d 648, 649 (1971) (\"We have viewed the evidence, as we must, in a light most favorable to appellee as the prevailing party below\"); Chillum-Adelphi Volunteer Fire- Dept., Inc. v. Button  Goode, Inc., 242 Md. App. 509, 516, 219 A. 2d 801, 805 (1966) (\"At common law, an arbitration award became a cause of action in favor of the prevailing party\"); Burch v. Scott, 1829 WL 1006, *15 (Md. Ct. App., Dec. 1829) (\"[T]he demurrer being set down to be argued, the court proceeds to affirm or reverse the decree, and the prevailing party takes the deposite\").~      ~      ~        2~         Our decision to award costs in Mansfield, C.  L. M. R. Co. v. Swan, 111 U.S. 379 (1884), does not \"tu[g] against the restrictive rule today's decision installs,\" post, at 9. Defendants had removed the case to federal court, and after losing on the merits, sought to have us vacate the judgment because the basis for removal (diversity of citizenship) was absent. We concluded that because defendants were responsible for the improper removal in the first place, our judgment's \"effect [was] to defeat the entire proceeding which they originated and have prosecuted,\" id., at 388. In other words, plaintiffs \"prevailed\" because defendants' original position as to jurisdiction was defeated. In Ficklen v. Danville, 146 Va. 426, 438-439 132 S. E. 705, 706 (1926), appellants were deemed to have \"substantially prevail[ed]\" on their appeal because appellees \"abandoned their contention made before the lower court,\" i.e., \"abandoned their intention and desire to rely upon the correctness of the trial court's decree.\" In Talmage v. Monroe, 119 P. 526 (Cal. App. 1911), costs were awarded after the defendant complied with an alternative writ of mandamus; it was the writ, not the mere petition, which led to defendant's action. Scatcherd v. Love, 166 F. 53 (CA6 1908), Wagner v. Wagner, 9 Pa. 214 (1848), and other cases cited by the dissent represent a rule adopted in some States that by settling a defendant \"acknowledged his liability,\" Scatcherd, supra, at 56; see also Wagner, supra, at 215. That rule was hardly uniform among the States. Compare 15 C. J. 89, 167 (1918) (citing cases from 13 States which hold that a \"settlement is equivalent to a confession of judgment\"), with id., at 89-90, 168, and n. a (citing cases from 11 States which hold that under a settlement \"plaintiff cannot recover costs,\" because \" [c]osts . . . can only follow a judgment or final determination of the action \" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). I do not think these state cases (and Scatcherd, a federal case applying state law) justify expanding the federal meaning of \"prevailing party\" (based on a \"confession of judgment\" fiction) to include the party accepting an out-of-court settlement-much less to expand it beyond settlements, to the domain of the \"catalyst theory.\"~        The only case cited by the dissent in which the conclusion of acknowledgment of liability was rested on something other than a settlement is Board of Ed. of Madison County v. Fowler, 192 Ga. 35, 14 S. E. 2d 478 (1941), which, in one of the states that considered settlement an acknowledgment of liability, analogized compliance with what had been sought by a mandamus suit to a settlement. This is a slim reed upon which to rest the broad conclusion of a catalyst theory.~      ~      ~        3~         The dissent incorrectly characterizes Parham as involving an undifferentiated \"finding or retention of jurisdiction,\" post, at 17, n. 11. In fact, Parham involved a finding that defendant had discriminated, and jurisdiction was retained so that that finding could be given effect, in the form of injunctive relief, should the defendant ever backslide in its voluntary provision of relief to plaintiffs. Jurisdiction was not retained to determine whether there had been discrimination, and I do not read the Court's opinion as suggesting a fee award would be appropriate in those circumstances.   The dissent notes that two other cases were cited in Senate legislative history (Parham is cited in legislative history from both the Senate and House) which it claims support the catalyst theory. If legislative history in general is a risky interpretive tool, legislative history from only one legislative chamber-and consisting of the citation of Court of Appeals cases that surely few if any Members of Congress read-is virtually worthless. In any event, Kopet v. Esquire Realty Co., 523 F.2d 1005 (CA2 1975), does not support the catalyst theory because defendant's voluntary compliance was not at issue. Fees were awarded on the dubious premise that discovery uncovered some documents of potential use in other litigation, making this more a case of an award of interim fees. Thomas v. Honeybrook Mines, 428 F.2d 981 (CA3 1970), is also inapposite. There, the question was whether counsel for union members whose fruitless efforts to sue the union had nonetheless spurred the union to sue the employer, should be paid out of a fund established by the union's victory. Whether the union members were \"prevailing parties\" in the union suit, or whether they were entitled to attorney's fees as \"prevailing parties\" in the earlier suit against the union, was not even at issue.~      ~      ~        4~         Even the legislative history relied upon by the dissent supports the conclusion that some merit is necessary to justify a fee award. See post, at 15, n. 9 (citing a House Report for the proposition that fee-shifting statutes are \" 'designed to give ['victims of civil rights violation'] access to the judicial process' \" (emphasis added)); ibid. (citing a Senate Report: \" '[I]f those who violate the Nation's fundamental laws are not to proceed with impunity,' \" fee awards are necessary (emphasis added)). And for the reasons given by the Court, see ante at 6-7, the catalyst theory's purported \"merit test\"-the ability to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, or the absence of frivolousness-is scant protection for the innocent.~      ~      ~        5~         That a few cases adopting the catalyst theory predate Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U.S. 755 (1987), see post, at 5, and n. 4, is irrelevant to my point. Absent our dicta in Hewitt, and in light of everything else we have said on this topic, see ante, at 5-6, it is unlikely that the catalyst theory would have achieved that universality of acceptance by the Courts of Appeals upon which the dissent relies.~      ~    ~    Ginsburg, J., dissenting~    ~      42~      The Court today holds that a plaintiff whose suit prompts the precise relief she seeks does not \"prevail,\" and hence cannot obtain an award of attorney's fees, unless she also secures a court entry memorializing her victory. The entry need not be a judgment on the merits. Nor need there be any finding of wrongdoing. A court-approved settlement will do.~    ~    ~      43~      The Court's insistence that there be a document filed in court-a litigated judgment or court-endorsed settlement-upsets long-prevailing Circuit precedent applicable to scores of federal fee-shifting statutes. The decision allows a defendant to escape a statutory obligation to pay a plaintiff's counsel fees, even though the suit's merit led the defendant to abandon the fray, to switch rather than fight on, to accord plaintiff sooner rather than later the principal redress sought in the complaint. Concomitantly, the Court's constricted definition of \"prevailing party,\" and consequent rejection of the \"catalyst theory,\" impede access to court for the less well-heeled, and shrink the incentive Congress created for the enforcement of federal law by private attorneys general.~    ~    ~      44~      In my view, the \"catalyst rule,\" as applied by the clear majority of Federal Circuits, is a key component of the fee-shifting statutes Congress adopted to advance enforcement of civil rights. Nothing in history, precedent, or plain English warrants the anemic construction of the term \"prevailing party\" the Court today imposes.~    ~    ~      45~      * Petitioner Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc. (Buckhannon), operates residential care homes for elderly persons who need assisted living, but not nursing services. Among Buckhannon's residents in October 1996 was 102- year-old Dorsey Pierce. Pierce had resided at Buckhannon for some four years. Her daughter lived nearby, and the care provided at Buckhannon met Pierce's needs. Until 1998, West Virginia had a \"self-preservation\" rule prohibiting homes like Buckhannon from accommodating persons unable to exit the premises without assistance in the event of a fire. Pierce and two other Buckhannon residents could not get to a fire exit without aid. Informed of these residents' limitations, West Virginia officials proceeded against Buckhannon for noncompliance with the self-preservation rule. On October 18, 1996, three orders issued, each commanding Buckhannon to \"cease operating . . . and to effect relocation of [its] existing population within thirty (30) days.\" App. 46-53.~    ~    ~      46~      Ten days later, Buckhannon and Pierce, together with an organization of residential homes and another Buckhannon resident (hereinafter plaintiffs), commenced litigation in Federal District Court to overturn the cease-and-desist orders and the self-preservation rule on which they rested. They sued the State, state agencies, and 18 officials (hereinafter defendants) alleging that the rule discriminated against persons with disabilities in violation of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (FHAA), 42 U.S.C.  3601 et seq., and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U.S. C. 12101 et seq. Plaintiffs sought an immediate order stopping defendants from closing Buckhannon's facilities, injunctive relief permanently barring enforcement of the self-preservation requirement, damages, and attorney's fees.~    ~    ~      47~      On November 1, 1996, at a hearing on plaintiffs' request for a temporary restraining order, defendants agreed to the entry of an interim order allowing Buckhannon to remain open without changing the individual plaintiffs' housing and care. Discovery followed. On January 2, 1998, facing the state defendants' sovereign immunity pleas, plaintiffs stipulated to dismissal of their demands for damages. In February 1998, in response to defendants' motion to dispose of the remainder of the case summarily, the District Court determined that plaintiffs had presented triable claims under the FHAA and ADA.~    ~    ~      48~      Less than a month after the District Court found that plaintiffs were entitled to a trial, the West Virginia Legislature repealed the self-preservation rule. Plaintiffs still allege, and seek to prove, that their suit triggered the statutory repeal. After the rule's demise, defendants moved to dismiss the case as moot, and plaintiffs sought attorney's fees as \"prevailing parties\" under the FHAA, 42 U.S.C.  3613(c)(2), and the ADA, 42 U.S.C.  12205.1~    ~    ~      49~      Finding no likelihood that West Virginia would reenact the self-preservation rule, the District Court agreed that the State's action had rendered the case moot. Turning to plaintiffs' application for attorney's fees, the District Court followed Fourth Circuit precedent requiring the denial of fees unless termination of the action was accompanied by a judgment, consent decree, or settlement.2 Plaintiffs did not appeal the mootness determination, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed the denial of attorney's fees. In sum, plaintiffs were denied fees not because they failed to achieve the relief they sought. On the contrary, they gained the very change they sought through their lawsuit when West Virginia repealed the self-preservation rule that would have stopped Buckhannon from caring for people like Dorsey Pierce.3~    ~    ~      50~      Prior to 1994, every Federal Court of Appeals (except the Federal Circuit, which had not addressed the issue) concluded that plaintiffs in situations like Buckhannon's and Pierce's could obtain a fee award if their suit acted as a \"catalyst\" for the change they sought, even if they did not obtain a judgment or consent decree.4 The Courts of Appeals found it \"clear that a party may be considered to have prevailed even when the legal action stops short of final ... judgment due to ... intervening mootness.\" Grano v. Barry, 783 F.2d 1104, 1108 (CADC 1986). Interpreting the term \"prevailing party\" in \"a practical sense,\" Stewart v. Hannon, 675 F.2d 846, 851 (CA7 1982) (citation omitted), federal courts across the country held that a party \"prevails\" for fee-shifting purposes when \"its ends are accomplished as a result of the litigation,\" Associated Builders  Contractors v. Orleans Parish School Bd., 919 F.2d 374, 378 (CA5 1990) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).~    ~    ~      51~      In 1994, the Fourth Circuit en banc, dividing 6-to-5, broke ranks with its sister courts. The court declared that, in light of Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103 (1992), a plaintiff could not become a \"prevailing party\" without \"an enforceable judgment, consent decree, or settlement.\" S-1 and S-2 v. State Bd. of Ed. of N. C., 21 F.3d 49, 51 (1994). As the Court today acknowledges, see ante, at 4-5, n. 5, and as we have previously observed, the language on which the Fourth Circuit relied was dictum: Farrar \"involved no catalytic effect\"; the issue plainly \"was not presented for this Court's decision in Farrar.\" Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 194 (2000).~    ~    ~      52~      After the Fourth Circuit's en banc ruling, nine Courts of Appeals reaffirmed their own consistently held interpretation of the term \"prevail.\"5 On this predominant view, \"[s]ecuring an enforceable decree or agreement may evidence prevailing party status, but the judgment or agreement simply embodies and enforces what is sought in bringing the lawsuit ... . Victory can be achieved well short of a final judgment (or its equivalent) ... . \" Marbley v. Bane, 57 F.3d 224, 234 (CA2 1995) (Jacobs, J.).~    ~    ~      53~      The array of federal court decisions applying the catalyst rule suggested three conditions necessary to a party's qualification as \"prevailing\" short of a favorable final judgment or consent decree. A plaintiff first had to show that the defendant provided \"some of the benefit sought\" by the lawsuit. Wheeler v. Towanda Area School Dist., 950 F.2d 128, 131 (CA3 1991). Under most Circuits' precedents, a plaintiff had to demonstrate as well that the suit stated a genuine claim, i.e., one that was at least \"colorable,\" not \"frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless.\" Grano, 783 F.2d, at 1110 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Plaintiff finally had to establish that her suit was a \"substantial\" or \"significant\" cause of defendant's action providing relief. Williams v. Leatherbury, 672 F.2d 549, 551 (CA5 1982). In some Circuits, to make this causation showing, plaintiff had to satisfy the trial court that the suit achieved results \"by threat of victory,\" not \"by dint of nuisance and threat of expense.\" Marbley, 57 F.3d, at 234-235; see also Hooper v. Demco, Inc., 37 F.3d 287, 293 (CA7 1994) (to render plaintiff \"prevailing party,\" suit \"must have prompted the defendant ... to act or cease its behavior based on the strength of the case, not 'wholly gratuitously' \"). One who crossed these three thresholds would be recognized as a \"prevailing party\" to whom the district court, \"in its discretion,\" supra, at 3-4, n. 1, could award attorney's fees.~    ~    ~      54~      Developed over decades and in legions of federal-court decisions, the catalyst rule and these implementing standards deserve this Court's respect and approbation.~    ~    II~    ~      55~      * The Court today detects a \"clear meaning\" of the term prevailing party, ante, at 12, that has heretofore eluded the large majority of courts construing those words. \"Prevailing party,\" today's opinion announces, means \"one who has been awarded some relief by the court,\" ante, at 4. The Court derives this \"clear meaning\" principally from Black's Law Dictionary, which defines a \"prevailing party,\" in critical part, as one \"in whose favor a judgment is rendered,\" ante, at 4 (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1145 (7th ed. 1999)).~    ~    ~      56~      One can entirely agree with Black's Law Dictionary that a party \"in whose favor a judgment is rendered\" prevails, and at the same time resist, as most Courts of Appeals have, any implication that only such a party may prevail. In prior cases, we have not treated Black's Law Dictionary as preclusively definitive; instead, we have accorded statutory terms, including legal \"term[s] of art,\" ante, at 4 (opinion of the Court); ante, at 6 (Scalia, J., concurring), a contextual reading. See, e.g., Pioneer Investment Services Co. v. Brunswick Associates Ltd. Partnership, 507 U.S. 380, 395-396, n. 14 (1993) (defining \"excusable neglect,\" as used in Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9006(b)(1), more broadly than Black's defines that term); United States v. Rodgers, 466 U.S. 475, 479-480 (1984) (adopting \"natural, nontechnical\" definition of word \"jurisdiction,\" as that term is used in 18 U.S.C.  1001 and declining to confine definition to \"narrower, more technical meanings,\" citing Black's). Notably, this Court did not refer to Black's Law Dictionary in Maher v. Gagne, 448 U.S. 122 (1980), which held that a consent decree could qualify a plaintiff as \"prevailing.\" The Court explained:~    ~    ~      57~      \"The fact that [plaintiff] prevailed through a settlement rather than through litigation does not weaken her claim to fees. Nothing in the language of [42 U.S.C.] 1988 conditions the District Court's power to award fees on full litigation of the issues or on a judicial determination that the plaintiff's rights have been violated.\" Id., at 129.~    ~    ~      58~      The spare \"prevailing party\" language of the fee-shifting provision applicable in Maher, and the similar wording of the fee-shifting provisions now before the Court, contrast with prescriptions that so tightly bind fees to judgments as to exclude the application of a catalyst concept. The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, for example, directs that fee awards to prisoners under 1988 be \"proportionately related to the court ordered relief for the violation.\" 110 Stat. 1321-72, as amended, 42 U.S.C.  1997e(d)(1)(B)(i) (1994 ed., Supp. IV) (emphasis added). That statute, by its express terms, forecloses an award to a prisoner on a catalyst theory. But the FHAA and ADA fee-shifting prescriptions, modeled on 42 U.S.C.  1988 unmodified, see supra, at 3-4, n. 1, do not similarly staple fee awards to \"court ordered relief.\" Their very terms do not foreclose a catalyst theory.~    ~    B~    ~      59~      It is altogether true, as the concurring opinion points out, ante, at 1-2, that litigation costs other than attorney's fees traditionally have been allowed to the \"prevailing party,\" and that a judgment winner ordinarily fits that description. It is not true, however, that precedent on costs calls for the judgment requirement the Court ironly adopts today for attorney's fees. Indeed, the first decision cited in the concurring opinion, Mansfield, C.  L. M. R. Co. v. Swan, 111 U.S. 379 (1884), see ante, at 1, tugs against the restrictive rule today's decision installs.~    ~    ~      60~      In Mansfield, plaintiffs commenced a contract action in state court. Over plaintiffs' objections, defendants successfully removed the suit to federal court. Plaintiffs prevailed on the merits there, and defendants obtained review here. See 111 U.S., at 380-381. This Court determined, on its own motion, that federal subject-matter jurisdiction was absent from the start. Based on that determination, the Court reversed the lower court's judgment for plaintiffs. Worse than entering and leaving this Courthouse equally \"emptyhanded,\" ante, at 4 (concurring opinion), the plaintiffs in Mansfield were stripped of the judgment they had won, including the \"judicial finding ... of the merits\" in their favor, ante, at 3 (concurring opinion). The Mansfield plaintiffs did, however, achieve this small consolation: The Court awarded them costs here as well as below. Recognizing that defendants had \"prevail[ed]\" in a \"formal and nominal sense,\" the Mansfield Court nonetheless concluded that \"[i]n a true and proper sense\" defendants were \"the losing and not the prevailing party.\" 111 U.S., at 388.~    ~    ~      61~      While Mansfield casts doubt on the present majority's \"formal and nominal\" approach, that decision does not consider whether costs would be in order for the plaintiff who obtains substantial relief, but no final judgment. Nor does \"a single case\" on which the concurring opinion today relies, ante, at 4.6 There are, however, enlightening analogies. In multiple instances, state high courts have regarded plaintiffs as prevailing, for costs taxation purposes, when defendants' voluntary conduct, mooting the suit, provided the relief that plaintiffs sought.7 The concurring opinion labors unconvincingly to distinguish these state law cases.8 A similar federal practice has been observed in cases governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d), the default rule allowing costs \"to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs.\" See 10 C. Wright, A. Miller,  M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure 2667, pp. 187-188 (2d ed. 1983) (When \"the defendant alters its conduct so that plaintiff's claim [for injunctive relief] becomes moot before judgment is reached, costs may be allowed [under Rule 54(d)] if the court finds that the changes were the result, at least in part, of plaintiff's litigation.\") (citing, inter alia, Black Hills Alliance v. Regional Forester, 526 F. Supp. 257 (ND 1981)).~    ~    ~      62~      In short, there is substantial support, both old and new, federal and state, for a costs award, \"in [the court's] discretion,\" supra, at 3, n. 1, to the plaintiff whose suit prompts the defendant to provide the relief plaintiff seeks.~    ~    C~    ~      63~      Recognizing that no practice set in stone, statute, rule, or precedent, see infra, at 21-22, dictates the proper construction of modern civil rights fee-shifting prescriptions, I would \"assume ... that Congress intends the words in its enactments to carry 'their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning.' \" Pioneer, 507 U.S., at 388 (defining \"excusable neglect\") (quoting Perrin v. United States, 444 U.S. 37, 42 (1979) (defining \"bribery\")); see also, e.g., Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 491 (1999) (defining \"substantially\" in light of ordinary usage); Rutledge v. United States, 517 U.S. 292, 299-300, n. 10 (1996) (similarly defining \"in concert\"). In everyday use, \"prevail\" means \"gain victory by virtue of strength or superiority: win mastery: triumph.\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1797 (1976). There are undoubtedly situations in which an individual's goal is to obtain approval of a judge, and in those situations, one cannot \"prevail\" short of a judge's formal declaration. In a piano competition or a figure skating contest, for example, the person who prevails is the person declared winner by the judges. However, where the ultimate goal is not an arbiter's approval, but a favorable alteration of actual circumstances, a formal declaration is not essential. Western democracies, for instance, \"prevailed\" in the Cold War even though the Soviet Union never formally surrendered. Among television viewers, John F. Kennedy \"prevailed\" in the first debate with Richard M. Nixon during the 1960 Presidential contest, even though moderator Howard K. Smith never declared a winner. See T. White, The Making of the President 1960, pp. 293-294 (1961).~    ~    ~      64~      A lawsuit's ultimate purpose is to achieve actual relief from an opponent. Favorable judgment may be instrumental in gaining that relief. Generally, however, \"the judicial decree is not the end but the means. At the end of the rainbow lies not a judgment, but some action (or cessation of action) by the defendant ... .\" Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U.S. 755, 761 (1987). On this common understanding, if a party reaches the \"sought-after destination,\" then the party \"prevails\" regardless of the \"route taken.\" Hennigan v. Ouachita Parish School Bd., 749 F.2d 1148, 1153 (CA5 1985).~    ~    ~      65~      Under a fair reading of the FHAA and ADA provisions in point, I would hold that a party \"prevails\" in \"a true and proper sense,\" Mansfield, 111 U.S., at 388, when she achieves, by instituting litigation, the practical relief sought in her complaint. The Court misreads Congress, as I see it, by insisting that, invariably, relief must be displayed in a judgment, and correspondingly that a defendant's voluntary action never suffices. In this case, Buckhannon's purpose in suing West Virginia officials was not narrowly to obtain a judge's approbation. The plaintiffs' objective was to stop enforcement of a rule requiring Buckhannon to evict residents like centenarian Dorsey Pierce as the price of remaining in business. If Buckhannon achieved that objective on account of the strength of its case, see supra, at 7-if it succeeded in keeping its doors open while housing and caring for Ms. Pierce and others similarly situated-then Buckhannon is properly judged a party who prevailed.~    ~    III~    ~      66~      As the Courts of Appeals have long recognized, the catalyst rule suitably advances Congress' endeavor to place private actions, in civil rights and other legislatively defined areas, securely within the federal law enforcement arsenal.~    ~    ~      67~      The catalyst rule stemmed from modern legislation extending civil rights protections and enforcement measures. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 included provisions for fee awards to \"prevailing parties\" in Title II (public accommodations), 42 U.S.C.  2000a-3(b), and Title VII (employment), 42 U.S.C.  2000e-5(k), but not in Title VI (federal programs). The provisions' central purpose was \"to promote vigorous enforcement\" of the laws by private plaintiffs; although using the two-way term \"prevailing party,\" Congress did not make fees available to plaintiffs and defendants on equal terms. Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412, 417, 421 (1978) (under Title VII, prevailing plaintiff qualifies for fee award absent \"special circumstances,\" but prevailing defendant may obtain fee award only if plaintiff's suit is \"frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation\").~    ~    ~      68~      Once the 1964 Act came into force, courts commenced to award fees regularly under the statutory authorizations, and sometimes without such authorization. See Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U.S. 240, 262, 270-271, n. 46 (1975). In Alyeska, this Court reaffirmed the \"American rule\" that a court generally may not award attorney's fees without a legislative instruction to do so. See id., at 269. To provide the authorization Alyeska required for fee awards under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, as well as under Reconstruction Era civil rights legislation, 42 U.S.C.  1981-1983, 1985, 1986 (1994 ed. and Supp. IV), and certain other enactments, Congress passed the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C.  1988 (1994 ed. and Supp. IV).~    ~    ~      69~      As explained in the Reports supporting 1988, civil rights statutes vindicate public policies \"of the highest priority,\" S. Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 3 (1976) (quoting Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U.S. 400, 402 (1968) (per curiam)), yet \"depend heavily on private enforcement,\" S. Rep. No. 94-1011, at 2. Persons who bring meritorious civil rights claims, in this light, serve as \"private attorneys general.\" Id., at 5; H. R. Rep. No. 94-1558, p. 2 (1976). Such suitors, Congress recognized, often \"cannot afford legal counsel.\" Id., at 1. They therefore experience \"severe hardshi[p]\" under the \"American Rule.\" Id., at 2. Congress enacted 1988 to ensure that nonaffluent plaintiffs would have \"effective access\" to the Nation's courts to enforce civil rights laws. Id., at 1.9 That objective accounts for the fee-shifting provisions before the Court in this case, prescriptions of the FHAA and the ADA modeled on 1988. See supra, at 3-4, n. 1.~    ~    ~      70~      Under the catalyst rule that held sway until today, plaintiffs who obtained the relief they sought through suit on genuine claims ordinarily qualified as \"prevailing parties,\" so that courts had discretion to award them their costs and fees. Persons with limited resources were not impelled to \"wage total law\" in order to assure that their counsel fees would be paid. They could accept relief, in money or of another kind, voluntarily proffered by a defendant who sought to avoid a recorded decree. And they could rely on a judge then to determine, in her equitable discretion, whether counsel fees were warranted and, if so, in what amount.10~    ~    ~      71~      Congress appears to have envisioned that very prospect. The Senate Report on the 1976 Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act states: \"[F]or purposes of the award of counsel fees, parties may be considered to have prevailed when they vindicate rights through a consent judgment or without formally obtaining relief.\" S. Rep. No. 94-1011, at 5 (emphasis added). In support, the Report cites cases in which parties recovered fees in the absence of any court-conferred relief.11 The House Report corroborates: \"[A]fter a complaint is filed, a defendant might voluntarily cease the unlawful practice. A court should still award fees even though it might conclude, as a matter of equity, that no formal relief, such as an injunction, is needed.\" H. R. Rep. No. 94-1558, at 7 (emphases added). These Reports, Courts of Appeals have observed, are hardly ambiguous. Compare ante, at 9 (\"legislative history ... is at best ambiguous\"), with, e.g., Dunn v. The Florida Bar, 889 F.2d 1010, 1013 (CA11 1989) (legislative history \"evinces a clear Congressional intent\" to permit award \"even when no formal judicial relief is obtained\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Robinson v. Kimbrough, 652 F.2d 458, 465 (CA5 1981) (same); American Constitutional Party v. Munro, 650 F.2d 184, 187 (CA9 1981) (Senate Report \"directs\" fee award under catalyst rule). Congress, I am convinced, understood that \" '[v]ictory' in a civil rights suit is typically a practical, rather than a strictly legal matter.\" Exeter-West Greenwich Regional School Dist. v. Pontarelli, 788 F.2d 47, 51 (CA1 1986) (citation omitted).~    ~    IV~    ~      72~      The Court identifies several \"policy arguments\" that might warrant rejection of the catalyst rule. See ante, at 10-11. A defendant might refrain from altering its conduct, fearing liability for fees as the price of voluntary action. See ante, at 10. Moreover, rejection of the catalyst rule has limited impact: Desisting from the challenged conduct will not render a case moot where damages are sought, and even when the plaintiff seeks only equitable relief, a defendant's voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not render the case moot \"unless it is 'absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.' \" Ibid. (quoting Friends of Earth, Inc., 528 U.S., at 189). Because a mootness dismissal is not easily achieved, the defendant may be impelled to settle, negotiating fees less generous than a court might award. See ante, at 11. Finally, a catalyst rule would \"require analysis of the defendant's subjective motivations,\" and thus protract the litigation. Ante, at 11.~    ~    ~      73~      The Court declines to look beneath the surface of these arguments, placing its reliance, instead, on a meaning of \"prevailing party\" that other jurists would scarcely recognize as plain. See ibid. Had the Court inspected the \"policy arguments\" listed in its opinion, I doubt it would have found them impressive.~    ~    ~      74~      In opposition to the argument that defendants will resist change in order to stave off an award of fees, one could urge that the catalyst rule may lead defendants promptly to comply with the law's requirements: the longer the litigation, the larger the fees. Indeed, one who knows noncompliance will be expensive might be encouraged to conform his conduct to the legal requirements before litigation is threatened. Cf. Hylton, Fee Shifting and Incentives to Comply with the Law, 46 Vand. L. Rev. 1069, 1121 (1993) (\"fee shifting in favor of prevailing plaintiffs enhances both incentives to comply with legal rules and incentives to settle disputes\"). No doubt, a mootness dismissal is unlikely when recurrence of the controversy is under the defendant's control. But, as earlier observed, see supra, at 16, why should this Court's fee-shifting rulings drive a plaintiff prepared to accept adequate relief, though out-of-court and unrecorded, to litigate on and on? And if the catalyst rule leads defendants to negotiate not only settlement terms but also allied counsel fees, is that not a consummation to applaud, not deplore?~    ~    ~      75~      As to the burden on the court, is it not the norm for the judge to whom the case has been assigned to resolve fee disputes (deciding whether an award is in order, and if it is, the amount due), thereby clearing the case from the calendar? If factfinding becomes necessary under the catalyst rule, is it not the sort that \"the district courts, in their factfinding expertise, deal with on a regular basis\"? Baumgartner v. Harrisburg Housing Auth., 21 F.3d 541, 548 (CA3 1994). Might not one conclude overall, as Courts of Appeals have suggested, that the catalyst rule \"saves judicial resources,\" Paris v. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 988 F.2d 236, 240 (CA1 1993), by encouraging \"plaintiffs to discontinue litigation after receiving through the defendant's acquiescence the remedy initially sought\"? Morris v. West Palm Beach, 194 F.3d 1203, 1207 (CA11 1999).~    ~    ~      76~      The concurring opinion adds another argument against the catalyst rule: That opinion sees the rule as accommodating the \"extortionist\" who obtains relief because of \"greater strength in financial resources, or superiority in media manipulation, rather than superiority in legal merit.\" Ante, at 8, 9. This concern overlooks both the character of the rule and the judicial superintendence Congress ordered for all fee allowances. The catalyst rule was auxiliary to fee-shifting statutes whose primary purpose is \"to promote the vigorous enforcement\" of the civil rights laws. Christiansburg Garment Co., 434 U.S., at 422. To that end, courts deemed the conduct-altering catalyst that counted to be the substance of the case, not merely the plaintiff's atypically superior financial resources, media ties, or political clout. See supra, at 7. And Congress assigned responsibility for awarding fees not to automatons unable to recognize extoritionists, but to judges expected and instructed to exercise \"discretion.\" See supra, at 3-4, n. 1. So viewed, the catalyst rule provided no berth for nuisance suits, see Hooper, 37 F.3d, at 292, or \"thinly disguised forms of extortion,\" Tyler v. Corner Constr. Corp., 167 F.3d 1202, 1206 (CA8 1999) (citation omitted).12~    ~    V~    ~      77~      As to our attorney fee precedents, the Court correctly observes, \"[w]e have never had occasion to decide whether the term 'prevailing party' allows an award of fees under the 'catalyst theory,' \" and \"there is language in our cases supporting both petitioners and respondents.\" Ante, at 4-5, n. 5. It bears emphasis, however, that in determining whether fee shifting is in order, the Court in the past has placed greatest weight not on any \"judicial imprimatur,\" ante, at 6, but on the practical impact of the lawsuit.13 In Maher v. Gagne, 448 U.S. 122 (1980), in which the Court held fees could be awarded on the basis of a consent decree, the opinion nowhere relied on the presence of a formal judgment. See supra, at 8; infra, at 22, n. 14. Some years later, in Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U.S. 755 (1987), the Court suggested that fees might be awarded the plaintiff who \"obtain[ed] relief without [the] benefit of a formal judgment.\" Id., at 760. The Court explained: \"If the defendant, under the pressure of the lawsuit, pays over a money claim before the judicial judgment is pronounced,\" or \"if the defendant, under pressure of [a suit for declaratory judgment], alters his conduct (or threatened conduct) towards the plaintiff,\" i.e., conduct \"that was the basis for the suit, the plaintiff will have prevailed.\" Id., at 761. I agree, and would apply that analysis to this case.~    ~    ~      78~      The Court posits a \" 'merit' requirement of our prior cases.\" Ante, at 7. Maher, however, affirmed an award of attorney's fees based on a consent decree that \"did not purport to adjudicate [plaintiff's] statutory or constitutional claims.\" 448 U.S., at 126, n. 8. The decree in Maher \"explicitly stated that 'nothing [therein was] intended to constitute an admission of fault by either party.' \" Ibid. The catalyst rule, in short, conflicts with none of \"our prior holdings,\" ante, at 7.14~    ~    ~      79~      * * *~    ~    ~      80~      The Court states that the term \"prevailing party\" in fee-shifting statutes has an \"accepted meaning.\" Ante, at 9. If that is so, the \"accepted meaning\" is not the one the Court today announces. It is, instead, the meaning accepted by every Court of Appeals to address the catalyst issue before our 1987 decision in Hewitt, see supra, at 5, n. 4, and disavowed since then only by the Fourth Circuit, see supra, at 6, n. 5. A plaintiff prevails, federal judges have overwhelmingly agreed, when a litigated judgment, consent decree, out-of-court settlement, or the defendant's voluntary, postcomplaint payment or change in con- duct in fact affords redress for the plaintiff's substantial grievances.~    ~    ~      81~      When this Court rejects the considered judgment prevailing in the Circuits, respect for our colleagues demands a cogent explanation. Today's decision does not provide one. The Court's narrow construction of the words \"prevailing party\" is unsupported by precedent and unaided by history or logic. Congress prescribed fee-shifting provisions like those included in the FHAA and ADA to encourage private enforcement of laws designed to advance civil rights. Fidelity to that purpose calls for court-awarded fees when a private party's lawsuit, whether or not its settlement is registered in court, vindicates rights Congress sought to secure. I would so hold and therefore dissent from the judgment and opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         The FHAA provides: \"In a civil action ... , the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party ... a reasonable attorney's fee and costs.\" 42 U.S.C.  3613(c)(2). Similarly, the ADA provides: \"In any action ... , the court ... , in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party ... a reasonable attorney's fee, including litigation expenses, and costs ... .\" 42 U.S.C.  12205. These ADA and FHAA provisions are modeled on other \"prevailing party\" statutes, notably the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C.  1988 (1994 ed. and Supp. IV). See H. R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, p. 140 (1991) (ADA); H. R. Rep. No. 100-711, pp. 16-17, n. 20 (1988) (FHAA). Section 1988 was \"patterned upon the attorney's fees provisions contained in Titles II and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.  2000a-3(b) and 2000e- 5(k), and 402 of the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1975, 42 U.S.C. 1973l(e).\" Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433, n. 7 (1983) (citing Hanrahan v. Hampton, 446 U.S. 754, 758, n. 4 (1980) (per curiam)). In accord with congressional intent, we have interpreted these fee-shifting provisions consistently across statutes. The Court so observes. See ante, at 4, n. 4. Notably, the statutes do not mandate fees, but provide for their award \"in [the court's] discretion.\"~      ~      ~        2~         On plaintiffs' motion, the District Court sanctioned defendants under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 for failing timely to notify plaintiffs \"that the proposed [repeal of the self-preservation rule] was progressing successfully at several stages ... during the pendency of [the] litigation.\" App. 144. In their Rule 11 motion, plaintiffs requested fees and costs totaling $62,459 to cover the expense of litigating after defendants became aware, but did not disclose, that elimination of the rule was likely. In the alternative, plaintiffs sought $3,252 to offset fees and expenses incurred in litigating the Rule 11 motion. The District Court, stating that \"the primary purpose of Rule 11 is to deter and not to compensate,\" awarded the smaller sum.

But cf. ante, at 12, and n. 5 (Scalia, J., concurring) (maintaining that this Court's decision in Hewitt \"improvidently suggested\" the catalyst rule, and asserting that only \"a few cases adopting the catalyst theory predate Hewitt\"). Hewitt said it was \"settled law\" that when a lawsuit prompts a defendant's \"voluntary action ... that redresses the plaintiff's grievances,\" the plaintiff \"is deemed to have prevailed despite the absence of a formal judgment in his favor.\" 482 U.S., at 760-761.

In The Baltimore, there was a judgment in one party's favor. See 8 Wall., at 384. The Court did not address the question whether costs are available absent such a judgment. The Baltimore's \"incident to the judgment\" language, which the concurrence emphasizes, ante, at 1, 2 (citing 8 Wall., at 388, 390), likely related to the once-maintained rule that a court without jurisdiction may not award costs. See Mayor v. Cooper, 6 Wall. 247, 250-251 (1868). That ancient rule figured some years later in Mansfield, C.  L. M. R. Co. v. Swan, 111 U.S. 379 (1884); the Court noted the \"universally recognized rule of the common law\" that, absent jurisdiction, a \"court can render no judgment for or against either party, [and therefore] cannot render a judgment even for costs.\" Id., at 387. Receding from that rule, the Court awarded costs, even upon dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, because \"there is a judgment or final order in the cause dismissing it for want of jurisdiction.\" Ibid.; see U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U.S. 18, 21 (1994).~      ~      ~        7~         See, e.g., Board of Ed. of Madison County v. Fowler, 192 Ga. 35, 36, 14 S. E. 2d 478, 479 (1941) (mandamus action dismissed as moot, but costs awarded to plaintiffs where \"the purposes of the mandamus petition were accomplished by the subsequent acts of the defendants, thus obviating the necessity for further proceeding\"); Baldwin v. Chesapeake  Potomac Tel. Co., 156 Md. 552, 557, 144 A. 703, 705 (1929) (costs awarded to plaintiff after trial court granted defendant's demurrer and plaintiff's appeal was dismissed \"based on an act of [defendant] performed after ... entry of the appeal\"; dismissal rendered \"it unnecessary to inquire into the merits of the suit\"); Ficklen v. Danville, 146 Va. 426, 438, 132 S. E. 705, 706 (1926) (costs on appeal awarded to plaintiffs, even though trial court denied injunctive relief and high court dismissed appeal due to mootness, because plaintiffs achieved the \"equivalent to ... 'substantially prevailing' \" in \"gain[ing] all they sought by the appeal\"); cf. Scatcherd v. Love, 166 F. 53, 55, 56 (CA6 1908) (although \"there was no judgment against the defendant upon the merits,\" defendant \"acknowledged its liability ... by paying to the plaintiff the sum of $5,000,\" rendering plaintiff the \"successful party\" entitled to costs); Talmage v. Monroe, 119 P. 526 (Cal. App. 1911) (fees awarded to petitioner after court issued \"alternative writ\" directing respondent either to take specified action or to show cause for not doing so, and respondent chose to take the action).~      ~      ~        8~           The concurrence urges that Baldwin is inapposite because it was an action \"in equity,\" and equity courts could award costs as the equities required. Ante, at 2. The catalyst rule becomes relevant, however, only when a party seeks relief of a sort traditionally typed equitable, i.e., a change of conduct, not damages. There is no such thing as an injunction at law, and therefore one cannot expect to find long-ago plaintiffs who quested after that mythical remedy and received voluntary relief. By the concurrence's reasoning, the paucity of precedent applying the catalyst rule to \"prevailing parties\" is an artifact of nothing more \"remarkable,\" ante, at 4, than the historic law-equity separation.~        The concurrence notes that the other cited cases \"all involve a judicial finding-or its equivalent, an acknowledgment by the  defendant-of the merits of plaintiff's case.\" Ante, at 3 (emphasis added). I agree. In Fowler and Scatcherd, however, the \"acknowledgment\" consisted of nothing more than the defendant's voluntary provision to the plaintiff of the relief that the plaintiff sought. See also, e.g., Jefferson R. R. Co. v. Weinman, 39 Ind. 231 (1872) (costs awarded where defendant voluntarily paid damages; no admission or merits judgment); Wagner v. Wagner, 9 Pa. 214 (1848) (same); Hudson v. Johnson, 1 Va. 10 (1791) (same). Common-law courts thus regarded a defendant's voluntary compliance, by settlement or otherwise, as an \"acknowledgment ... of the merits\" sufficient to warrant treatment of a plaintiff as prevailing. But cf. ante, at 5, n. 7 (opinion of the Court). One can only wonder why the concurring opinion would not follow the same practice today.~      ~      ~        9~         See H. R. Rep. No. 94-1558, at 1 (\"Because a vast majority of the victims of civil rights violations cannot afford legal counsel, they are unable to present their cases to the courts... . [This statute] is designed to give such persons effective access to the judicial process ... .\"); S. Rep. No. 94-1011, at 2 (\"If private citizens are to be able to assert their civil rights, and if those who violate the Nation's fundamental laws are not to proceed with impunity, then citizens must have the opportunity to recover what it costs them to vindicate these rights in court.\"), quoted in part in Kay v. Ehrler, 499 U.S. 432, 436, n. 8 (1991). See also Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U.S. 400, 401-402 (1968) (per curiam) (\"When the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, it was evident that enforcement would prove difficult and that the Nation would have to rely in part upon private litigation as a means of securing broad compliance with the law... . [Congress] enacted the provision for counsel fees ... to encourage individuals injured by racial discrimination to seek judicial relief ... .\").~      ~      ~        10~         Given the protection furnished by the catalyst rule, aggrieved individuals were not left to worry, and wrongdoers were not led to believe, that strategic maneuvers by defendants might succeed in averting a fee award. Cf. ante, at 10 (opinion of the Court). Apt here is Judge Friendly's observation construing a fee-shifting statute kin to the provisions before us: \"Congress clearly did not mean that where a [Freedom of Information Act] suit had gone to trial and developments have made it apparent that the judge was about to rule for the plaintiff, the Government could abort any award of attorney fees by an eleventh hour tender of information.\" Vermont Low Income Advocacy Council v. Usery, 546 F.2d 509, 513 (CA2 1976) (interpreting 5 U.S.C.  552(a)(4)(E), allowing a complainant who \"substantially prevails\" to earn an attorney's fee); accord, Cuneo v. Rumsfeld, 553 F.2d 1360, 1364 (CADC 1977).~      ~      ~        11~         See S. Rep. No. 94-1011, at 5 (citing Kopet v. Esquire Realty Co., 523 F.2d 1005, 1008-1009 (CA2 1975) (partner sued his firm for release of documents, firm released the documents, court awarded fees because of the release, even though the partner's claims were \"dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction\"), and Thomas v. Honeybrook Mines, Inc., 428 F.2d 981, 984, 985 (CA3 1970) (union committee twice commenced suit for pension fund payments, suits prompted recovery, and court awarded fees even though the first suit had been dismissed and the second had not yet been adjudicated)). The Court features a case cited by the House as well as the Senate in the Reports on 1988, Parham v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 433 F.2d 421 (CA8 1970). The Court deems Parham consistent with its rejection of the catalyst rule, alternately because the Eighth Circuit made a \"finding that the defendant had acted unlawfully,\" and because that court ordered the District Court to \" 'retain jurisdiction over the matter ... to insure the continued implementation of the [defendant's] policy of equal employment opportunities.' \" Ante, at 9, n. 9 (quoting 433 F.2d, at 429). Congress did not fix on those factors, however: Nothing in either Report suggests that judicial findings or retention of jurisdiction is essential to an award of fees. The courts in Kopet and Thomas awarded fees based on claims as to which they neither made \"a finding\" nor \"retain[ed] jurisdiction.\" (It nonetheless bears attention that, in line with the Court's description of Parham, a plaintiff could qualify as the \"prevailing party\" based on a finding or retention of jurisdiction.)~      ~      ~        12~         The concurring opinion notes, correctly, that \"[t]here must be a cut-off of seemingly equivalent entitlements to fees-either the failure to file suit in time or the failure to obtain a judgment in time.\" Ante, at 11. The former cutoff, the Court has held, is impelled both by \"plain language\" requiring a legal \"action\" or \"proceeding\" antecedent to a fee award, and by \"legislative history ... replete with references to [enforcement] 'in suits,' 'through the courts' and by 'judicial process.' \" North Carolina Dept. of Transp. v. Crest Street Community Council, Inc., 479 U.S. 6, 12 (1986) (citations omitted). The latter cut-off, requiring \"a judgment in time,\" is not similarly impelled by text or legislative history. The concurring opinion also states that a prevailing party must obtain relief \"in the lawsuit.\" Ante, at 6, 9. One can demur to that elaboration of the statutory text and still adhere to the catalyst rule. Under the rule, plaintiff's suit raising genuine issues must trigger the defendant's voluntary action; plaintiff will not prevail under the rule if defendant \"ceases ... [his] offensive conduct\" by dying or going bankrupt. See ante, at 6. A behavior-altering event like dying or bankruptcy occurs outside the lawsuit; a change precipitated by the lawsuit's claims and demand for relief is an occurrence brought about \"through\" or \"in\" the suit.~      ~      ~        13~         To qualify for fees in any case, we have held, relief must be real. See Rhodes v. Stewart, 488 U.S. 1, 4 (1988) (per curiam) (a plaintiff who obtains a formal declaratory judgment, but gains no real \"relief whatsoever,\" is not a \"prevailing party\" eligible for fees); Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U.S., at 761 (an interlocutory decision reversing a dismissal for failure to state a claim, although stating that plaintiff's rights were violated, does not entitle plaintiff to fees; to \"prevail,\" plaintiff must gain relief of \"substance,\" i.e., more than a favorable \"judicial statement that does not affect the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant\").~      ~      ~        14~         The Court repeatedly quotes passages from Hanrahan v. Hampton, 446 U.S., at 757-758, stating that to \"prevail,\" plaintiffs must receive relief \"on the merits.\" Ante, at 5, 6, 9. Nothing in Hanrahan, however, declares that relief \"on the merits\" requires a \"judicial imprimatur.\" Ante, at 6. As the Court acknowledges, Hanrahan concerned an interim award of fees, after plaintiff succeeded in obtaining nothing more than reversal of a directed verdict. See ante, at 6. At that juncture, plaintiff had obtained no change in defendant's behavior, and the suit's ultimate winner remained undetermined. There is simply no inconsistency between Hanrahan, denying fees when a plaintiff might yet obtain no real benefit, and the catalyst rule, allowing fees when a plaintiff obtains the practical result she sought in suing. Indeed, the harmony between the catalyst rule and Hanrahan is suggested by Hanrahan itself; like Maher v. Gagne, 448 U.S. 122, 129 (1980), Hanrahan quoted the Senate Report recognizing that parties may prevail \"through a consent judgment or without formally obtaining relief.\" 446 U.S., at 757 (quoting S. Rep. No. 94-1011, at 5) (emphasis added). Hanrahan also selected for citation the influential elaboration of the catalyst rule in Nadeau v. Helgemoe, 581 F.2d, at 279-281. See 446 U.S., at 757.~      ~    ~    ~      82~      The Court additionally cites Texas State Teachers Assn. v. Garland Independent School Dist., 489 U.S. 782 (1989), which held, unanimously, that a plaintiff could become a \"prevailing party\" without obtaining relief on the \"central issue in the suit.\" Id., at 790. Texas State Teachers linked fee awards to a \"material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties,\" id., at 792-793, but did not say, as the Court does today, that the change must be \"court-ordered,\" ante, at 5, 6. The parties' legal relationship does change when the defendant stops engaging in the conduct that furnishes the basis for plaintiff's civil action, and that action, which both parties would otherwise have litigated, is dismissed. The decision with language most unfavorable to the catalyst rule, Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103 (1992), does not figure prominently in the Court's opinion-and for good reason, for Farrar \"involved no catalytic effect.\" See ante, at 4, n. 5 (quoting Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 194 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted)); supra, at 5-6. Farrar held that a plaintiff who sought damages of $17 million, but received damages of $1, was a \"prevailing party\" nonetheless not entitled to fees. 506 U.S., at 113-116. In reinforcing the link between the right to a fee award and the \"degree of success obtained,\" id., at 114 (quoting Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S., at 436), Farrar's holding is consistent with the catalyst rule.~    ~    ",

Readers are requested to notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D. C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.ATKINSON TRADING COMPANY, INC., PETITIONERv.JOE SHIRLEY, Jr., et al.~    No. 00-454.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued March 27, 2001Decided May 29, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      In Montana v. United States, 450 U.S. 544, this Court held that, with two limited exceptions, Indian tribes lack civil authority over the conduct of nonmembers on non-Indian land within a reservation. Petitioner's trading post on such land within the Navajo Nation Reservation is subject to a hotel occupancy tax that the Tribe imposes on any hotel room located within the reservation's boundaries. The Federal District Court upheld the tax, and the Tenth Circuit affirmed. Relying in part on Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U.S. 130, the latter court complemented Montana's framework with a case-by-case approach that balanced the land's non-Indian fee status with the Tribe's sovereign powers, its interests, and the impact that the exercise of its powers had on the nonmembers' interests. The court concluded that the tax fell under Montana's first exception.~      Held: The Navajo Nation's imposition of a hotel occupancy tax upon nonmembers on non-Indian fee land within its reservation is invalid. Pp. 8-14.~      (a) Montana's general rule applies to tribal attempts to tax nonmember activity occurring on non-Indian fee land. Tribal jurisdiction is limited: For powers not expressly conferred them by federal statute or treaty, tribes must rely upon their retained or inherent sovereignty. Their power over nonmembers on non-Indian fee land is sharply circumscribed. Montana noted only two exceptions: (1) a tribe may regulate the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members; and (2) a tribe may exercise civil authority over the conduct of non-Indians on fee lands within its reservation when that conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the tribe's political integrity, economic security, or health or welfare. 450 U.S., at 565-566. Montana's rule applies to a tribe's regulatory authority, id., at 566, and adjudicatory authority, Strate v. A-1 Contractors, 520 U.S. 438, 453. Citing Merrion, respondents submit that Montana and Strate do not restrict a tribe's power to impose revenue-raising taxes. However, because Merrion noted that a tribe's inherent taxing power only extended to transactions occurring on trust lands and involving the tribe or its members, 455 U.S., at 137, it is easily reconcilable with the Montana-Strate line of authority. A tribe's sovereign power to tax reaches no further than tribal land. Thus, Merrion does not exempt taxation from Montana's general rule, and Montana is applied straight up. Because Congress had not authorized the tax at issue through treaty or statute, and because the incidence of the tax falls upon nonmembers on non-Indian fee land, the Navajo Nation must establish the existence of one of Montana's exceptions. Pp. 3-8.~      (b) Montana's exceptions do not obtain here. Neither petitioner nor its hotel guests have entered into a consensual relationship with the Navajo Nation justifying the tax's imposition. Such a relationship must stem from commercial dealing, contracts, leases, or other arrangements, Montana, supra, at 565, and a nonmember's actual or potential receipt of tribal police, fire, and medical services does not create the requisite connection. Nor is petitioner's status as an \"Indian trader\" licensed by the Indian Affairs Commissioner sufficient by itself to support the tax's imposition. As to Montana's second exception, petitioner's operation of a hotel on non-Indian fee land does not threaten or have a direct effect on the tribe's political integrity, economic security, or health or welfare. Contrary to respondents' argument, the judgment in Brendale v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 492 U.S. 408, 440, did not give Indian tribes broad authority over nonmembers where the acreage of non-Indian fee land is miniscule in relation to the surrounding tribal land. Irrespective of the percentage of non-Indian fee land within a reservation, Montana's second exception grants tribes nothing beyond what is necessary to protect tribal self-government or control internal relations. Strate, supra, at 459. Whatever effect petitioner's operation of its trading post might have upon surrounding Navajo land, it does not endanger the Navajo Nation's political integrity.

United States, 450 U.S. 544 (1981), we held that, with limited exceptions, Indian tribes lack civil authority over the conduct of nonmembers on non-Indian fee land within a reservation. The question with which we are presented is whether this general rule applies to tribal attempts to tax nonmember activity occurring on non-Indian fee land. We hold that it does and that neither of Montana's exceptions obtains here.~    ~    ~      2~      In 1916, Hubert Richardson, lured by the possibility of trading with wealthy Gray Mountain Navajo cattlemen, built the Cameron Trading Post just south of the Little Colorado River near Cameron, Arizona. G. Richardson, Navajo Trader, pp. 136-137 (1986). Richardson purchased the land directly from the United States, but the Navajo Nation Reservation, which had been established in 1868, see 15 Stat. 667, was later extended eight miles south so that the Cameron Trading Post fell within its exterior boundaries. See Act of June 14, 1934, ch. 521, 48 Stat. 960-962. This 1934 enlargement of the Navajo Reservation-which today stretches across northeast Arizona, northwest New Mexico, and southeast Utah-did not alter the status of the property: It is, like millions of acres throughout the United States, non-Indian fee land within a tribal reservation.~    ~    ~      3~      Richardson's \"drafty, wooden store building and four small, one-room-shack cabins overlooking the bare river canyon,\" Richardson, supra, at 135, have since evolved into a business complex consisting of a hotel, restaurant, cafeteria, gallery, curio shop, retail store, and recreational vehicle facility. The current owner, petitioner Atkinson Trading Company, Inc., benefits from the Cameron Trading Post's location near the intersection of Arizona Highway 64 (which leads west to the Grand Canyon) and United States Highway 89 (which connects Flagstaff on the south with Glen Canyon Dam to the north). A significant portion of petitioner's hotel business stems from tourists on their way to or from the Grand Canyon National Park.~    ~    ~      4~      In 1992, the Navajo Nation enacted a hotel occupancy tax, which imposes an 8 percent tax upon any hotel room located within the exterior boundaries of the Navajo Nation Reservation. See 24 Navajo Nation Code 101-142 (1995), App. to Pet. for Cert. 102a-124a. Although the legal incidence of the tax falls directly upon the guests, the owner or operator of the hotel must collect and remit it to respondents, members of the Navajo Tax Commission. 104, 107. The nonmember guests at the Cameron Trading Post pay approximately $84,000 in taxes to respondents annually.~    ~    ~      5~      Petitioner's challenge under Montana to the Navajo Nation's authority to impose the hotel occupancy tax was rejected by both the Navajo Tax Commission and the Navajo Supreme Court. Petitioner then sought relief in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, which also upheld the tax. A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed. See 210 F.3d 1247 (2000).~    ~    ~      6~      Although the Court of Appeals agreed with petitioner that our cases in this area \"did make an issue of the fee status of the land in question,\" id., at 1256, it nonetheless concluded that the status of the land as \"fee land or tribal land is simply one of the factors a court should consider\" when determining whether civil jurisdiction exists, id., at 1258 (citing 18 U.S.C.  1151). Relying in part upon our decision in Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U.S. 130 (1982), the court \"complement[ed]\" Montana's framework with a \"case-by-case approach\" that balanced the non-Indian fee status of the land with \"the nature of the inherent sovereign powers the tribe is attempting to exercise, its interests, and the impact that the exercise of the tribe's powers has upon the nonmember interests involved.\" 210 F.3d, at 1255, 1257, 1261. The Court of Appeals then likened the Navajo hotel occupancy tax to similar taxes imposed by New Mexico and Arizona, concluding that the tax fell under Montana's first exception because a \"consensual relationship exists in that the nonmember guests could refrain from the privilege of lodging within the confines of the Navajo Reservation and therefore remain free from liability for the [tax].\" Id., at 1263 (citing Buster v. Wright, 135 F. 947, 949 (CA8 1905)). The dissenting judge would have applied Montana without \"any language or 'factors' derived from Merrion\" and concluded that, based upon her view of the record, none of the Montana exceptions applied. Id., at 1269 (Briscoe, J., dissenting).~    ~    ~      7~      We granted certiorari, 531 U.S. 1009 (2000), and now reverse.~    ~    ~      8~      Tribal jurisdiction is limited: For powers not expressly conferred them by federal statute or treaty, Indian tribes must rely upon their retained or inherent sovereignty. In Montana, the most exhaustively reasoned of our modern cases addressing this latter authority, we observed that Indian tribe power over nonmembers on non-Indian fee land is sharply circumscribed. At issue in Montana was the Crow Tribe's attempt to regulate nonmember fishing and hunting on non-Indian fee land within the reservation. Although we \"readily agree[d]\" that the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty authorized the Crow Tribe to prohibit nonmembers from hunting or fishing on tribal land, 450 U.S., at 557, we held that such \"power cannot apply to lands held in fee by non-Indians.\" Id., at 559. This delineation of members and nonmembers, tribal land and non-Indian fee land, stemmed from the dependent nature of tribal sovereignty. Surveying our cases in this area dating back to 1810, see Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 147 (1810) (Johnson, J., concurring) (stating that Indian tribes have lost any \"right of governing every person within their limits except themselves\"), we noted that \"through their original incorporation into the United States as well as through specific treaties and statutes, Indian tribes have lost many of the attributes of sovereignty.\" 450 U.S., at 563.1 We concluded that the inherent sovereignty of Indian tribes was limited to \"their members and their territory\": \"[E]xercise of tribal power beyond what is necessary to protect tribal self-government or to control internal relations is inconsistent with the dependent status of the tribes.\" Id., at 564 (citing United States v. Wheeler, 435 U.S. 313, 326 (1978) (\"[T]he dependent status of Indian tribes ... is necessarily inconsistent with their freedom to determine their external relations\" (emphasis deleted))).~    ~    ~      9~      Although we extracted from our precedents \"the general proposition that the inherent sovereign powers of an Indian tribe do not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe,\" 450 U.S., at 565, we nonetheless noted in Montana two possible bases for tribal jurisdiction over non-Indian fee land. First, \"[a] tribe may regulate, through taxation, licensing, or other means, the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members, through commercial dealings, contracts, leases, or other arrangements.\" Ibid. Second, \"[a] tribe may . . . exercise civil authority over the conduct of non-Indians on fee lands within its reservation when that conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe.\" Id., at 566. Applying these precepts, we found that the nonmembers at issue there had not subjected themselves to \"tribal civil jurisdiction\" through any agreements or dealings with the Tribe and that hunting and fishing on non-Indian fee land did not \"imperil the subsistence or welfare of the Tribe.\" Ibid. We therefore held that the Crow Tribe's regulations could not be enforced.~    ~    ~      10~      The framework set forth in Montana \"broadly addressed the concept of 'inherent sovereignty.' \" Strate v. A-1 Contractors, 520 U.S. 438, 453 (1997) (quoting Montana, supra, at 563). In Strate, we dealt with the Three Affiliated Tribes' assertion of judicial jurisdiction over an automobile accident involving two nonmembers traveling on a state highway within the reservation. Although we did not question the ability of tribal police to patrol the highway, see 520 U.S., at 456, n. 11, we likened the public right-of-way to non-Indian fee land because the Tribes lacked the power to \"assert a landowner's right to occupy and exclude,\" id., at 456. Recognizing that Montana \"immediately involved regulatory authority,\"2 we nonetheless concluded that its reasoning had \"delineated-in a main rule and exceptions-the bounds of the power tribes retain to exercise 'forms of civil jurisdiction over non-Indians.' \" 520 U.S., at 453 (quoting Montana, supra, at 565). We accordingly held that Montana governed tribal assertions of adjudicatory authority over non-Indian fee land within a reservation. See 520 U.S., at 453 (\"Subject to controlling provisions in treaties and statutes, and the two exceptions identified in Montana, the civil authority of Indian tribes and their courts with respect to non-Indian fee lands generally 'do[es] not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe' \" (emphasis added) (quoting Montana, supra, at 565)).~    ~    ~      11~      Citing our decision in Merrion, respondents submit that Montana and Strate do not restrict an Indian tribe's power to impose revenue-raising taxes.3 In Merrion, just one year after our decision in Montana, we upheld a severance tax imposed by the Jicarilla Apache Tribe upon non-Indian lessees authorized to extract oil and gas from tribal land. In so doing, we noted that the power to tax derives not solely from an Indian tribe's power to exclude non-Indians from tribal land, but also from an Indian tribe's \"general authority, as sovereign, to control economic activity within its jurisdiction.\" 455 U.S., at 137. Such authority, we held, was incident to the benefits conferred upon nonmembers: \"They benefit from the provision of police protection and other governmental services, as well as from \" 'the advantages of a civilized society' \" that are assured by the existence of tribal government.\" Id., at 137-138 (quoting Exxon Corp. v. Department of Revenue of Wis., 447 U.S. 207, 228 (1980)).~    ~    ~      12~      Merrion, however, was careful to note that an Indian tribe's inherent power to tax only extended to \" 'transactions occurring on trust lands and significantly involving a tribe or its members.' \" 455 U.S., at 137. (emphasis added) (quoting Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation, 447 U.S. 134, 152 (1980)). There are undoubtedly parts of the Merrion opinion that suggest a broader scope for tribal taxing authority than the quoted language above.4 But Merrion involved a tax that only applied to activity occurring on the reservation, and its holding is therefore easily reconcilable with the Montana-Strate line of authority, which we deem to be controlling. See Merrion, supra, at 142 (\"[A] tribe has no authority over a nonmember until the nonmember enters tribal lands or conducts business with the tribe\"). An Indian tribe's sovereign power to tax-whatever its derivation-reaches no further than tribal land.5~    ~    ~      13~      We therefore do not read Merrion to exempt taxation from Montana's general rule that Indian tribes lack civil authority over nonmembers on non-Indian fee land. Accordingly, as in Strate, we apply Montana straight up. Because Congress has not authorized the Navajo Nation's hotel occupancy tax through treaty or statute, and because the incidence of the tax falls upon nonmembers on non-Indian fee land, it is incumbent upon the Navajo Nation to establish the existence of one of Montana's exceptions.~    ~    ~      14~      Respondents argue that both petitioner and its hotel guests have entered into a consensual relationship with the Navajo Nation justifying the imposition of the hotel occupancy tax.6 Echoing the reasoning of the Court of Appeals, respondents note that the Cameron Trading Post benefits from the numerous services provided by the Navajo Nation. The record reflects that the Arizona State Police and the Navajo Tribal Police patrol the portions of United States Highway 89 and Arizona Highway 64 traversing the reservation; that the Navajo Tribal Police and the Navajo Tribal Emergency Medical Services Department will respond to an emergency call from the Cameron Trading Post; and that local Arizona Fire Departments and the Navajo Tribal Fire Department provide fire protection to the area.7 Although we do not question the Navajo Nation's ability to charge an appropriate fee for a particular service actually rendered,8 we think the generalized availability of tribal services patently insufficient to sustain the Tribe's civil authority over nonmembers on non-Indian fee land.~    ~    ~      15~      The consensual relationship must stem from \"commercial dealing, contracts, leases, or other arrangements,\" Montana, 450 U.S., at 565, and a nonmember's actual or potential receipt of tribal police, fire, and medical services does not create the requisite connection. If it did, the exception would swallow the rule: All non-Indian fee lands within a reservation benefit, to some extent, from the \"advantages of a civilized society\" offered by the Indian tribe. Merrion, supra, at 137-138 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Such a result does not square with our precedents; indeed, we implicitly rejected this argument in Strate,9 where we held that the nonmembers had not consented to the Tribes' adjudicatory authority by availing themselves of the benefit of tribal police protection while traveling within the reservation. See 520 U.S., at 456-457, and n. 11. We therefore reject respondents' broad reading of Montana's first exception, which ignores the dependent status of Indian tribes and subverts the territorial restriction upon tribal power.~    ~    ~      16~      Respondents and their principal amicus, the United States, also argue that petitioner consented to the tax by becoming an \"Indian trader.\" Congress has authorized the Commissioner of Indian Affairs \"to appoint traders to the Indian tribes and to make such rules and regulations as he may deem just and proper specifying the kind and quantity of goods and the prices at which such goods shall be sold to the Indians.\" 25 U.S.C.  261. Petitioner has acquired the requisite license to transact business with the Navajo Nation and therefore is subject to the regulatory strictures promulgated by the Indian Affairs Commissioner. See 25 CFR pt. 141 (2000).10 But whether or not the Navajo Nation could impose a tax on activities arising out of this relationship, an issue not before us, it is clear that petitioner's \"Indian trader\" status by itself cannot support the imposition of the hotel occupancy tax.~    ~    ~      17~      Montana's consensual relationship exception requires that the tax or regulation imposed by the Indian tribe have a nexus to the consensual relationship itself. In Strate, for example, even though respondent A-1 Contractors was on the reservation to perform landscaping work for the Three Affiliated Tribes at the time of the accident, we nonetheless held that the Tribes lacked adjudicatory authority because the other nonmember \"was not a party to the subcontract, and the [T]ribes were strangers to the accident.\" 520 U.S., at 457 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A nonmember's consensual relationship in one area thus does not trigger tribal civil authority in another-it is not \"in for a penny, in for a Pound.\" E. Ravenscroft, The Canterbury Guests; Or A Bargain Broken, act v, sc. 1. The hotel occupancy tax at issue here is grounded in petitioner's relationship with its nonmember hotel guests, who can reach the Cameron Trading Post on United States Highway 89 and Arizona Highway 64, non-Indian public rights-of-way. Petitioner cannot be said to have consented to such a tax by virtue of its status as an \"Indian trader.\"~    ~    ~      18~      Although the Court of Appeals did not reach Montana's second exception, both respondents and the United States argue that the hotel occupancy tax is warranted in light of the direct effects the Cameron Trading Post has upon the Navajo Nation. Again noting the Navajo Nation's provision of tribal services and petitioner's status as an \"Indian trader,\" respondents emphasize that petitioner employs almost 100 Navajo Indians; that the Cameron Trading Post derives business from tourists visiting the reservation; and that large amounts of tribal land surround petitioner's isolated property.11 Although we have no cause to doubt respondents' assertion that the Cameron Chapter of the Navajo Nation possesses an \"overwhelming Indian character,\" Brief for Respondents 13-14, we fail to see how petitioner's operation of a hotel on non-Indian fee land \"threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe.\" Montana, 450 U.S., at 566.12~    ~    ~      19~      We find unpersuasive respondents' attempt to augment this claim by reference to Brendale v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 492 U.S. 408, 440 (1989) (opinion of Stevens, J.). In this portion of Brendale, per the reasoning of two Justices, we held that the Yakima Nation had the authority to zone a small, non-Indian parcel located \"in the heart\" of over 800,000 acres of closed and largely uninhabited tribal land. Ibid. Respondents extrapolate from this holding that Indian tribes enjoy broad authority over nonmembers wherever the acreage of non-Indian fee land is miniscule in relation to the surrounding tribal land. But we think it plain that the judgment in Brendale turned on both the closed nature of the non-Indian fee land13 and the fact that its development would place the entire area \"in jeopardy.\" Id., at 443 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).14 Irrespective of the percentage of non-Indian fee land within a reservation, Montana's second exception grants Indian tribes nothing \" 'beyond what is necessary to protect tribal self-government or to control internal relations.' \" Strate, 520 U.S., at 459 (quoting Montana, supra, at 564). Whatever effect petitioner's operation of the Cameron Trading Post might have upon surrounding Navajo land, it does not endanger the Navajo Nation's political integrity. See Brendale, supra, at 431 (opinion of White, J.) (holding that the impact of the nonmember's conduct \"must be demonstrably serious and must imperil the political integrity, the economic security, or the health and welfare of the tribe\").~    ~    ~      20~      Indian tribes are \"unique aggregations possessing attributes of sovereignty over both their members and their territory,\" but their dependent status generally precludes extension of tribal civil authority beyond these limits. United States v. Mazurie, 419 U.S. 544, 557 (1975). The Navajo Nation's imposition of a tax upon nonmembers on non-Indian fee land within the reservation is, therefore, presumptively invalid. Because respondents have failed to establish that the hotel occupancy tax is commensurately related to any consensual relationship with petitioner or is necessary to vindicate the Navajo Nation's political integrity, the presumption ripens into a holding. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit is accordingly Reversed.~    ~    ~      21~      Souter, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Kennedy and Thomas, JJ., joined.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         We also noted that nearly 90 million acres of non-Indian fee land had been acquired as part of the Indian General Allotment Act, 24 Stat. 388, as amended, 25 U.S.C.  331 et seq., which authorized the issuance of patents in fee to individual Indian allottees who, after holding the patent for 25 years, could then transfer the land to non-Indians. Although Congress repudiated the practice of allotment in the Indian Reorganization Act, 48 Stat. 984, 25 U.S.C.  461 et seq., we nonetheless found significant that Congress equated alienation \"with the dissolution of tribal affairs and jurisdiction.\" Montana 450 U.S., at 559, n. 9. We thus concluded that it \"defie[d] common sense to suppose that Congress would intend that non-Indians purchasing allotted lands would become subject to tribal jurisdiction.\" Ibid.~      ~      ~        2~         See also South Dakota v. Bourland, 508 U.S. 679 (1993); Brendale v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 492 U.S. 408 (1989).~      ~      ~        3~         Respondents concede that regulatory taxes fall under the Montana framework. See 450 U.S., at 565 (\"A tribe may regulate, through taxation . . . the activities of nonmembers\").~      ~      ~        4~         Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 544 U.S. 130 (1982), for example, referenced the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in Buster v. Wright, 135 F. 947 (1905). But we have never endorsed Buster's statement that an Indian tribe's \"jurisdiction to govern the inhabitants of a country is not conditioned or limited by the title to the land which they occupy in it.\" Id., at 951. Accordingly, beyond any guidance it might provide as to the type of consensual relationship contemplated by the first exception of Montana v. United States, 450 U.S. 544, 566 (1981), Buster is not an authoritative precedent.~      ~      ~        5~         We find misplaced the Court of Appeals' reliance upon 18 U.S.C.  1151 a statute conferring upon Indian tribes jurisdiction over certain criminal acts occurring in \"Indian country,\" or \"all land within the limits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States Government, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and, including rights-of-way running through the reservation.\" See also Duro v. Reina, 495 U.S. 676, 680, n. 1 (1990). Although  1151 has been relied upon to demarcate state, federal, and tribal jurisdiction over criminal and civil matters, see DeCoteau v. District County Court for Tenth Judicial Dist., 420 U.S. 425, 427, n. 2 (1975) (\"While  1151 is concerned, on its face, only with criminal jurisdiction, the Court has recognized that it generally applies as well to questions of civil jurisdiction [citing cases]\"), we do not here deal with a claim of statutorily conferred power. Section 1151 simply does not address an Indian tribe's inherent or retained sovereignty over nonmembers on non-Indian fee land. At least in the context of non-Indian fee land, we also find inapt the Court of Appeals' analogy to state taxing authority. Our reference in Merrion to a State's ability to tax activities with which it has a substantial nexus was made in the context of describing an Indian tribe's authority over tribal land. See 455 U.S., at 137-138 (citing Exxon Corp. v. Department of Revenue of Wis., 447 U.S. 207, 228 (1980); Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U.S. 434, 445 (1979)). Only full territorial sovereigns enjoy the \"power to enforce laws against all who come within the sovereign's territory, whether citizens or aliens,\" and Indian tribes \"can no longer be described as sovereigns in this sense.\" Duro v. Reina, supra, at 685.~      ~      ~        6~         Because the legal incidence of the tax falls directly upon the guests, not petitioner, it is unclear whether the Tribe's relationship with petitioner is at all relevant. We need not, however, decide this issue since the hotel occupancy tax exceeds the Tribe's authority even considering petitioner's contacts with the Navajo Nation.~      ~      ~        7~         The Navajo Tribal Fire Department has responded to a fire at the Cameron Trading Post. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 57a.~      ~      ~        8~         The Navajo Nation charges for its emergency medical services (a flat call-out fee of $300 and a mileage fee of $6.25 per mile). See App. 127-129.~      ~      ~        9~         See Reply Brief for Petitioners 13-14 and Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29 in Strate v. A-1 Contractors, O. T. No. 95-1872.~      ~      ~        10~         Although the regulations do not \"preclude\" the Navajo Nation from imposing upon \"Indian traders\" such \"fees or taxes [it] may deem appropriate,\" the regulations do not contemplate or authorize the hotel occupancy tax at issue here. 25 CFR  141.11 (2000).~      ~      ~        11~         The record does not reflect the amount of non-Indian fee land within the Navajo Nation. A 1995 study commissioned by the United States Department of Commerce states that 96.3 percent of the Navajo Nation's 16,224,896 acres is tribally owned, with allotted land comprising 762,749 acres, or 4.7 percent, of the reservation. See Economic Development Administration V. Tiller, American Indian Reservations and Indian Trust Areas, p. 214 (1995). The 1990 Census reports that that 96.6 percent of residents on the Navajo Nation are Indian. Joint Lodging 182. The Cameron Chapter of the Navajo Nation, in which petitioner's land lies, has a non-Indian population of 2.3 percent. See id., at 181.~      ~      ~        12~         Although language in Merrion referred to taxation as \"necessary to tribal self-government and territorial management,\" 455 U.S., at 141, it did not address assertions of tribal jurisdiction over non-Indian fee land. Just as with Montana's first exception, incorporating Merrion's reasoning here would be tantamount to rejecting Montana's general rule. In Strate v. A-1 Contractors, 520 U.S. 438, 459 (1997), we stated that Montana's second exception \"can be misperceived.\" The exception is only triggered by nonmember conduct that threatens the Indian tribe, it does not broadly permit the exercise of civil authority wherever it might be considered \"necessary\" to self-government. Thus, unless the drain of the nonmember's conduct upon tribal services and resources is so severe that it actually \"imperil[s]\" the political integrity of the Indian tribe, there can be no assertion of civil authority beyond tribal lands. Montana, 450 U.S., at 566. Petitioner's hotel has no such adverse effect upon the Navajo Nation.~      ~      ~        13~         Justice Stevens' opinion in Brendale sets out in some detail the restrictive nature of \"closed area\" surrounding the non-Indian fee land. See 492 U.S., at 438-441. Pursuant to the powers reserved it in an 1855 treaty with the United States, the Yakima Nation closed this forested area to the public and severely limited the activities of those who entered the land through a \"courtesy permit system.\" Id., at 439 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The record here establishes that, save a few natural areas and parks not at issue, the Navajo reservation is open to the general public. App. 61.~      ~      ~        14~         See Strate v. A-1 Contractors, supra, at 447, n. 6 (noting that the Yakima Nation \"retained zoning authority . . . only in the closed area\"); Duro v. Reina, 495 U.S., at 688 (noting that zoning is \"is vital to the maintenance of tribal integrity and self-determination\").~      ~    ~    Souter, J., concurring~    ~      22~      If we are to see coherence in the various manifestations of the general law of tribal jurisdiction over non-Indians, the source of doctrine must be Montana v. United States, 450 U.S. 544 (1981), and it is in light of that case that I join the Court's opinion. Under Montana, the status of territory within a reservation's boundaries as tribal or fee land may have much to do (as it does here) with the likelihood (or not) that facts will exist that are relevant under the exceptions to Montana's \"general proposition\" that \"the inherent sovereign powers of an Indian tribe do not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe.\" Id., at 565. That general proposition is, however, the first principle, regardless of whether the land at issue is fee land, or land owned by or held in trust for an Indian tribe.~    ~    ",

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.PGA TOUR, INC., PETITIONERv.CASEY MARTIN~    No. 00-24.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued January 17, 2001Decided May 29, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      Petitioner sponsors professional golf tournaments conducted on three annual tours. A player may gain entry into the tours in various ways, most commonly through successfully competing in a three-stage qualifying tournament known as the \"Q-School.\" Any member of the public may enter the Q-School by submitting two letters of recommendation and paying a $3,000 entry fee to cover greens fees and the cost of golf carts, which are permitted during the first two stages, but have been prohibited during the third stage since 1997. The rules governing competition in tour events include the \"Rules of Golf,\" which apply at all levels of amateur and professional golf and do not prohibit the use of golf carts, and the \"hard card,\" which applies specifically to petitioner's professional tours and requires players to walk the golf course during tournaments, except in \"open\" qualifying events for each tournament and on petitioner's senior tour. Respondent Martin is a talented golfer afflicted with a degenerative circulatory disorder that prevents him from walking golf courses. His disorder constitutes a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U.S.C.  12101 et seq. When Martin turned pro and entered the Q-School, he made a request, supported by detailed medical records, for permission to use a golf cart during the third stage. Petitioner refused, and Martin filed this action under Title III of the ADA, which, among other things, requires an entity operating \"public accommodations\" to make \"reasonable modifications\" in its policies \"when ... necessary to afford such ... accommodations to individuals with disabilities, unless the entity can demonstrate that making such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of such ... accommodations,\" 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii) (emphasis added). In denying petitioner summary judgment, the Magistrate Judge rejected its contention, among others, that the play areas of its tour competitions are not places of \"public accommodation\" within Title III's scope. After trial, the District Court entered a permanent injunction requiring petitioner to permit Martin to use a cart. Among its rulings, that court found that the walking rule's purpose was to inject fatigue into the skill of shot-making, but that the fatigue injected by walking a golf course cannot be deemed significant under normal circumstances; determined that even with the use of a cart, the fatigue Martin suffers from coping with his disability is greater than the fatigue his able-bodied competitors endure from walking the course; and concluded that it would not fundamentally alter the nature of petitioner's game to accommodate Martin. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding, inter alia, that golf courses, including play areas, are places of public accommodation during professional tournaments and that permitting Martin to use a cart would not \"fundamentally alter\" the nature of those tournaments.~      Held:   1. Title III of the ADA, by its plain terms, prohibits petitioner from denying Martin equal access to its tours on the basis of his disability. Cf. Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 209. That Title provides, as a general rule, that \"[n]o individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of a disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the ... privileges ... of any place of public accommodation.\" 12182(a). The phrase \"public accommodation\" is defined in terms of 12 extensive categories, 12181(7), which the legislative history indicates should be construed liberally to afford people with disabilities equal access to the wide variety of establishments available to the nondisabled. Given the general rule and the comprehensive definition of \"public accommodation,\" it is apparent that petitioner's golf tours and their qualifying rounds fit comfortably within Title III's coverage, and Martin within its protection. The events occur on \"golf course[s],\" a type of place specifically identified as a public accommodation. 12181(7)(L). And, at all relevant times, petitioner \"leases\" and \"operates\" golf courses to conduct its Q-School and tours. 12182(a). As a lessor and operator, petitioner must not discriminate against any \"individual\" in the \"full and equal enjoyment of the ... privileges\" of those courses. Ibid. Among those \"privileges\" are competing in the Q-School and playing in the tours; indeed, the former is a privilege for which thousands of individuals from the general public pay, and the latter is one for which they vie. Martin is one of those individuals. The Court rejects petitioner's argument that competing golfers are not members of the class protected by Title III-i.e., \"clients or customers of the covered public accommodation,\" 12182(b)(1)(A)(iv)-but are providers of the entertainment petitioner sells, so that their \"job-related\" discrimination claims may only be brought under Title I. Even if Title III's protected class were so limited, it would be entirely appropriate to classify the golfers who pay petitioner $3,000 for the chance to compete in the Q-School and, if successful, in the subsequent tour events, as petitioner's clients or customers. This conclusion is consistent with case law in the analogous context of Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. See, e.g., Daniel v. Paul, 395 U.S. 298, 306. Pp. 12-19.~      2. Allowing Martin to use a golf cart, despite petitioner's walking requirement, is not a modification that would \"fundamentally alter the nature\" of petitioner's tours or the third stage of the Q-School. In theory, a modification of the tournaments might constitute a fundamental alteration in these ways: (1) It might alter such an essential aspect of golf, e.g., the diameter of the hole, that it would be unacceptable even if it affected all competitors equally; or (2) a less significant change that has only a peripheral impact on the game itself might nevertheless give a disabled player, in addition to access to the competition as required by Title III, an advantage over others and therefore fundamentally alter the character of the competition. The Court is not persuaded that a waiver of the walking rule for Martin would work a fundamental alteration in either sense. The use of carts is not inconsistent with the fundamental character of golf, the essence of which has always been shot-making. The walking rule contained in petitioner's hard cards is neither an essential attribute of the game itself nor an indispensable feature of tournament golf. The Court rejects petitioner's attempt to distinguish golf as it is generally played from the game at the highest level, where, petitioner claims, the waiver of an \"outcome-affecting\" rule such as the walking rule would violate the governing principle that competitors must be subject to identical substantive rules, thereby fundamentally altering the nature of tournament events. That argument's force is mitigated by the fact that it is impossible to guarantee that all golfers will play under exactly the same conditions or that an individual's ability will be the sole determinant of the outcome. Further, the factual basis of petitioner's argument-that the walking rule is \"outcome affecting\" because fatigue may adversely affect performance-is undermined by the District Court's finding that the fatigue from walking during a tournament cannot be deemed significant. Even if petitioner's factual predicate is accepted, its legal position is fatally flawed because its refusal to consider Martin's personal circumstances in deciding whether to accommodate his disability runs counter to the ADA's requirement that an individualized inquiry be conducted. Cf. Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 483. There is no doubt that allowing Martin to use a cart would not fundamentally alter the nature of petitioner's tournaments, given the District Court's uncontested finding that Martin endures greater fatigue with a cart than his able-bodied competitors do by walking. The waiver of a peripheral tournament rule that does not impair its purpose cannot be said to fundamentally alter the nature of the athletic event. Pp. 19-29.~      204 F.3d 994, affirmed.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT~      Stevens, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor, Kennedy, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      This case raises two questions concerning the application of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 328, 42 U.S.C.  12101 et seq., to a gifted athlete: first, whether the Act protects access to professional golf tournaments by a qualified entrant with a disability; and second, whether a disabled contestant may be denied the use of a golf cart because it would \"fundamentally alter the nature\" of the tournaments, 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii), to allow him to ride when all other contestants must walk.~    ~    ~      2~      * Petitioner PGA TOUR, Inc., a nonprofit entity formed in 1968, sponsors and cosponsors professional golf tournaments conducted on three annual tours. About 200 golfers participate in the PGA TOUR; about 170 in the NIKE TOUR1; and about 100 in the SENIOR PGA TOUR. PGA TOUR and NIKE TOUR tournaments typically are 4-day events, played on courses leased and operated by petitioner. The entire field usually competes in two 18-hole rounds played on Thursday and Friday; those who survive the \"cut\" play on Saturday and Sunday and receive prize money in amounts determined by their aggregate scores for all four rounds. The revenues generated by television, admissions, concessions, and contributions from cosponsors amount to about $300 million a year, much of which is distributed in prize money.~    ~    ~      3~      There are various ways of gaining entry into particular tours. For example, a player who wins three NIKE TOUR events in the same year, or is among the top-15 money winners on that tour, earns the right to play in the PGA TOUR. Additionally, a golfer may obtain a spot in an official tournament through successfully competing in \"open\" qualifying rounds, which are conducted the week before each tournament. Most participants, however, earn playing privileges in the PGA TOUR or NIKE TOUR by way of a three-stage qualifying tournament known as the \"Q-School.\"~    ~    ~      4~      Any member of the public may enter the Q-School by paying a $3,000 entry fee and submitting two letters of reference from, among others, PGA TOUR or NIKE TOUR members. The $3,000 entry fee covers the players' greens fees and the cost of golf carts, which are permitted during the first two stages, but which have been prohibited during the third stage since 1997. Each year, over a thousand contestants compete in the first stage, which consists of four 18-hole rounds at different locations. Approximately half of them make it to the second stage, which also includes 72 holes. Around 168 players survive the second stage and advance to the final one, where they compete over 108 holes. Of those finalists, about a fourth qualify for membership in the PGA TOUR, and the rest gain membership in the NIKE TOUR. The significance of making it into either tour is illuminated by the fact that there are about 25 million golfers in the country.2~    ~    ~      5~      Three sets of rules govern competition in tour events. First, the \"Rules of Golf,\" jointly written by the United States Golf Association (USGA) and the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of Scotland, apply to the game as it is played, not only by millions of amateurs on public courses and in private country clubs throughout the United States and worldwide, but also by the professionals in the tournaments conducted by petitioner, the USGA, the Ladies' Professional Golf Association, and the Senior Women's Golf Association. Those rules do not prohibit the use of golf carts at any time.3~    ~    ~      6~      Second, the \"Conditions of Competition and Local Rules,\" often described as the \"hard card,\" apply specifically to petitioner's professional tours. The hard cards for the PGA TOUR and NIKE TOUR require players to walk the golf course during tournaments, but not during open qualifying rounds.4 On the SENIOR PGA TOUR, which is limited to golfers age 50 and older, the contestants may use golf carts. Most seniors, however, prefer to walk.5~    ~    ~      7~      Third, \"Notices to Competitors\" are issued for particular tournaments and cover conditions for that specific event. Such a notice may, for example, explain how the Rules of Golf should be applied to a particular water hazard or man-made obstruction. It might also authorize the use of carts to speed up play when there is an unusual distance between one green and the next tee.6~    ~    ~      8~      The basic Rules of Golf, the hard cards, and the weekly notices apply equally to all players in tour competitions. As one of petitioner's witnesses explained with reference to \"the Masters Tournament, which is golf at its very highest level ... the key is to have everyone tee off on the first hole under exactly the same conditions and all of them be tested over that 72-hole event under the conditions that exist during those four days of the event.\" App. 192.~    ~    II~    ~      9~      Casey Martin is a talented golfer. As an amateur, he won 17 Oregon Golf Association junior events before he was 15, and won the state championship as a high school senior. He played on the Stanford University golf team that won the 1994 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championship. As a professional, Martin qualified for the NIKE TOUR in 1998 and 1999, and based on his 1999 performance, qualified for the PGA TOUR in 2000. In the 1999 season, he entered 24 events, made the cut 13 times, and had 6 top-10 finishes, coming in second twice and third once.~    ~    ~      10~      Martin is also an individual with a disability as defined in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA or Act).7 Since birth he has been afflicted with Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome, a degenerative circulatory disorder that obstructs the flow of blood from his right leg back to his heart. The disease is progressive; it causes severe pain and has atrophied his right leg. During the latter part of his college career, because of the progress of the disease, Martin could no longer walk an 18-hole golf course.8 Walking not only caused him pain, fatigue, and anxiety, but also created a significant risk of hemorrhaging, developing blood clots, and fracturing his tibia so badly that an amputation might be required. For these reasons, Stanford made written requests to the Pacific 10 Conference and the NCAA to waive for Martin their rules requiring players to walk and carry their own clubs. The requests were granted.9~    ~    ~      11~      When Martin turned pro and entered petitioner's Q-School, the hard card permitted him to use a cart during his successful progress through the first two stages. He made a request, supported by detailed medical records, for permission to use a golf cart during the third stage. Petitioner refused to review those records or to waive its walking rule for the third stage. Martin therefore filed this action. A preliminary injunction entered by the District Court made it possible for him to use a cart in the final stage of the Q-School and as a competitor in the NIKE TOUR and PGA TOUR. Although not bound by the injunction, and despite its support for petitioner's position in this litigation, the USGA voluntarily granted Martin a similar waiver in events that it sponsors, including the U.S. Open.~    ~    III~    ~      12~      In the District Court, petitioner moved for summary judgment on the ground that it is exempt from coverage under Title III of the ADA as a \"private clu[b] or establishmen[t],\"10 or alternatively, that the play areas of its tour competitions do not constitute places of \"public accommodation\" within the scope of that Title.11 The Magistrate Judge concluded that petitioner should be viewed as a commercial enterprise operating in the entertainment industry for the economic benefit of its members rather than as a private club. Furthermore, after noting that the statutory definition of public accommodation included a \"golf course,\"12 he rejected petitioner's argument that its competitions are only places of public accommodation in the areas open to spectators. The operator of a public accommodation could not, in his view, \"create private enclaves within the facility ... and thus relegate the ADA to hop-scotch areas.\" 984 F. Supp. 1320, 1326-1327 (Ore. 1998). Accordingly, he denied petitioner's motion for summary judgment.~    ~    ~      13~      At trial, petitioner did not contest the conclusion that Martin has a disability covered by the ADA, or the fact \"that his disability prevents him from walking the course during a round of golf.\" 994 F. Supp. 1242, 1244 (Ore. 1998). Rather, petitioner asserted that the condition of walking is a substantive rule of competition, and that waiving it as to any individual for any reason would fundamentally alter the nature of the competition. Petitioner's evidence included the testimony of a number of experts, among them some of the greatest golfers in history. Arnold Palmer,13 Jack Nicklaus,14 and Ken Venturi15 explained that fatigue can be a critical factor in a tournament, particularly on the last day when psychological pressure is at a maximum. Their testimony makes it clear that, in their view, permission to use a cart might well give some players a competitive advantage over other players who must walk. They did not, however, express any opinion on whether a cart would give Martin such an advantage.16~    ~    ~      14~      Rejecting petitioner's argument that an individualized inquiry into the necessity of the walking rule in Martin's case would be inappropriate, the District Court stated that it had \"the independent duty to inquire into the purpose of the rule at issue, and to ascertain whether there can be a reasonable modification made to accommodate plaintiff without frustrating the purpose of the rule\" and thereby fundamentally altering the nature of petitioner's tournaments. Id., at 1246. The judge found that the purpose of the rule was to inject fatigue into the skill of shot-making, but that the fatigue injected \"by walking the course cannot be deemed significant under normal circumstances.\" Id., at 1250. Furthermore, Martin presented evidence, and the judge found, that even with the use of a cart, Martin must walk over a mile during an 18-hole round,17 and that the fatigue he suffers from coping with his disability is \"undeniably greater\" than the fatigue his able-bodied competitors endure from walking the course. Id., at 1251. As the judge observed:~    ~    ~      15~      \"[P]laintiff is in significant pain when he walks, and even when he is getting in and out of the cart. With each step, he is at risk of fracturing his tibia and hemorrhaging. The other golfers have to endure the psychological stress of competition as part of their fatigue; Martin has the same stress plus the added stress of pain and risk of serious injury. As he put it, he would gladly trade the cart for a good leg. To perceive that the cart puts him-with his condition-at a competitive advantage is a gross distortion of reality.\" Id., at 1251-1252.~    ~    ~      16~      As a result, the judge concluded that it would \"not fundamentally alter the nature of the PGA Tour's game to accommodate him with a cart.\" Id., at 1252. The judge accordingly entered a permanent injunction requiring petitioner to permit Martin to use a cart in tour and qualifying events.~    ~    ~      17~      On appeal to the Ninth Circuit, petitioner did not challenge the District Court's rejection of its claim that it was exempt as a \"private club,\" but it renewed the contention that during a tournament the portion of the golf course \" 'behind the ropes' is not a public accommodation because the public has no right to enter it.\" 204 F.3d 994, 997 (2000). The Court of Appeals viewed that contention as resting on the incorrect assumption that the competition among participants was not itself public. The court first pointed out that, as with a private university, \"the fact that users of a facility are highly selected does not mean that the facility cannot be a public accommodation.\" Id., at 998.18 In its opinion, the competition to enter the select circle of PGA TOUR and NIKE TOUR golfers was comparable because \"[a]ny member of the public who pays a $3000 entry fee and supplies two letters of recommendation may try out in the qualifying school.\" Id., at 999. The court saw \"no justification in reason or in the statute to draw a line beyond which the performance of athletes becomes so excellent that a competition restricted to their level deprives its situs of the character of a public accommodation.\" Ibid. Nor did it find a basis for distinguishing between \"use of a place of public accommodation for pleasure and use in the pursuit of a living.\" Ibid. Consequently, the Court of Appeals concluded that golf courses remain places of public accommodation during PGA tournaments. Ibid.~    ~    ~      18~      On the merits, because there was no serious dispute about the fact that permitting Martin to use a golf cart was both a reasonable and a necessary solution to the problem of providing him access to the tournaments, the Court of Appeals regarded the central dispute as whether such permission would \"fundamentally alter\" the nature of the PGA TOUR or NIKE TOUR. Like the District Court, the Court of Appeals viewed the issue not as \"whether use of carts generally would fundamentally alter the competition, but whether the use of a cart by Martin would do so.\" Id., at 1001. That issue turned on \"an intensively fact-based inquiry,\" and, the court concluded, had been correctly resolved by the trial judge. In its words, \"[a]ll that the cart does is permit Martin access to a type of competition in which he otherwise could not engage because of his disability.\" Id., at 1000.~    ~    ~      19~      The day after the Ninth Circuit ruled in Martin's favor, the Seventh Circuit came to a contrary conclusion in a case brought against the USGA by a disabled golfer who failed to qualify for \"America's greatest-and most democratic-golf tournament, the United States Open.\" Olinger v. United States Golf Assn., 205 F.3d 1001 (2000).19 The Seventh Circuit endorsed the conclusion of the District Court in that case that \"the nature of the competition would be fundamentally altered if the walking rule were eliminated because it would remove stamina (at least a particular type of stamina) from the set of qualities designed to be tested in this competition.\" Id., at 1006 (internal quotation marks omitted). In the Seventh Circuit's opinion, the physical ordeals endured by Ken Venturi and Ben Hogan when they walked to their Open victories in 1964 and 1950 amply demonstrated the importance of stamina in such a tournament.20 As an alternative basis for its holding, the court also concluded that the ADA does not require the USGA to bear \"the administrative burdens of evaluating requests to waive the walking rule and permit the use of a golf cart.\" Id., at 1007.~    ~    ~      20~      Although the Seventh Circuit merely assumed that the ADA applies to professional golf tournaments, and therefore did not disagree with the Ninth on the threshold coverage issue, our grant of certiorari, 530 U.S. 1306 (2000), encompasses that question as well as the conflict between those courts.~    ~    IV~    ~      21~      Congress enacted the ADA in 1990 to remedy widespread discrimination against disabled individuals. In studying the need for such legislation, Congress found that \"historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem.\" 42 U.S.C.  12101(a)(2); see 12101(a)(3) (\"[D]iscrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as employment, housing, public accommodations, education, transportation, communication, recreation, institutionalization, health services, voting, and access to public services\"). Congress noted that the many forms such discrimination takes include \"outright intentional exclusion\" as well as the \"failure to make modifications to existing facilities and practices.\" 12101(a)(5). After thoroughly investigating the problem, Congress concluded that there was a \"compelling need\" for a \"clear and comprehensive national mandate\" to eliminate discrimination against disabled individuals, and to integrate them \"into the economic and social mainstream of American life.\" S. Rep. No. 101-116, p. 20 (1989); H. R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, p. 50 (1990).~    ~    ~      22~      In the ADA, Congress provided that broad mandate. See 42 U.S.C.  12101(b). In fact, one of the Act's \"most impressive strengths\" has been identified as its \"comprehensive character,\" Hearings on S. 933 before the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources and the Subcommittee on the Handicapped, 101st Cong., 1st Sess., 197 (1989) (statement of Attorney General Thornburgh), and accordingly the Act has been described as \"a milestone on the path to a more decent, tolerant, progressive society,\" Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 375 (2001) (Kennedy, J., concurring). To effectuate its sweeping purpose, the ADA forbids discrimination against disabled individuals in major areas of public life, among them employment (Title I of the Act),21 public services (Title II),22 and public accommodations (Title III).23 At issue now, as a threshold matter, is the applicability of Title III to petitioner's golf tours and qualifying rounds, in particular to petitioner's treatment of a qualified disabled golfer wishing to compete in those events.~    ~    ~      23~      Title III of the ADA prescribes, as a \"[g]eneral rule\":~    ~    ~      24~      \"No individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.\" 42 U.S.C.  12182(a).~    ~    ~      25~      The phrase \"public accommodation\" is defined in terms of 12 extensive categories,24 which the legislative history indicates \"should be construed liberally\" to afford people with disabilities \"equal access\" to the wide variety of establishments available to the nondisabled.25~    ~    ~      26~      It seems apparent, from both the general rule and the comprehensive definition of \"public accommodation,\" that petitioner's golf tours and their qualifying rounds fit comfortably within the coverage of Title III, and Martin within its protection. The events occur on \"golf course[s],\" a type of place specifically identified by the Act as a public accommodation. 12181(7)(L). In addition, at all relevant times, petitioner \"leases\" and \"operates\" golf courses to conduct its Q-School and tours. 12182(a). As a lessor and operator of golf courses, then, petitioner must not discriminate against any \"individual\" in the \"full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations\" of those courses. Ibid. Certainly, among the \"privileges\" offered by petitioner on the courses are those of competing in the Q-School and playing in the tours; indeed, the former is a privilege for which thousands of individuals from the general public pay, and the latter is one for which they vie. Martin, of course, is one of those individuals. It would therefore appear that Title III of the ADA, by its plain terms, prohibits petitioner from denying Martin equal access to its tours on the basis of his disability. Cf. Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 209 (1998) (holding that text of Title II's prohibition of discrimination by \"public entities\" against disabled individuals \"unmistakably includes State prisons and prisoners within its coverage\").~    ~    ~      27~      Petitioner argues otherwise. To be clear about its position, it does not assert (as it did in the District Court) that it is a private club altogether exempt from Title III's coverage. In fact, petitioner admits that its tournaments are conducted at places of public accommodation.26 Nor does petitioner contend (as it did in both the District Court and the Court of Appeals) that the competitors' area \"behind the ropes\" is not a public accommodation, notwithstanding the status of the rest of the golf course. Rather, petitioner reframes the coverage issue by arguing that the competing golfers are not members of the class protected by Title III of the ADA.27~    ~    ~      28~      According to petitioner, Title III is concerned with discrimination against \"clients and customers\" seeking to obtain \"goods and services\" at places of  public accommodation, whereas it is Title I that protects persons who work at such places.28 As the argument goes, petitioner operates not a \"golf course\" during its tournaments but a \"place of exhibition or entertainment,\" 42 U.S.C.  12181(7)(C), and a professional golfer such as Martin, like an actor in a theater production, is a provider rather than a consumer of the entertainment that petitioner sells to the public. Martin therefore cannot bring a claim under Title III because he is not one of the \" 'clients or customers of the covered public accommodation.' \"29 Rather, Martin's claim of discrimination is \"job-related\"30 and could only be brought under Title I-but that Title does not apply because he is an independent contractor (as the District Court found) rather than an employee.~    ~    ~      29~      The reference to \"clients or customers\" that petitioner quotes appears in 42 U.S.C.  12182(b)(1)(A)(iv), which states: \"For purposes of clauses (i) through (iii) of this subparagraph, the term 'individual or class of individuals' refers to the clients or customers of the covered public accommodation that enters into the contractual, licensing or other arrangement.\" Clauses (i) through (iii) of the subparagraph prohibit public accommodations from discriminating against a disabled \"individual or class of individuals\" in certain ways31 either directly or indirectly through contractual arrangements with other entities. Those clauses make clear on the one hand that their prohibitions cannot be avoided by means of contract, while clause (iv) makes clear on the other hand that contractual relationships will not expand a public accommodation's obligations under the subparagraph beyond its own clients or customers.~    ~    ~      30~      As petitioner recognizes, clause (iv) is not literally applicable to Title III's general rule prohibiting discrimination against disabled individuals.32 Title III's broad general rule contains no express \"clients or customers\" limitation, 12182(a), and 12182(b)(1)(A)(iv) provides that its limitation is only \"[f]or purposes of\" the clauses in that separate subparagraph. Nevertheless, petitioner contends that clause (iv)'s restriction of the subparagraph's coverage to the clients or customers of public accommodations fairly describes the scope of Title III's protection as a whole.~    ~    ~      31~      We need not decide whether petitioner's construction of the statute is correct, because petitioner's argument falters even on its own terms. If Title III's protected class were limited to \"clients or customers,\" it would be entirely appropriate to classify the golfers who pay petitioner $3,000 for the chance to compete in the Q-School and, if successful, in the subsequent tour events, as petitioner's clients or customers. In our view, petitioner's tournaments (whether situated at a \"golf course\" or at a \"place of exhibition or entertainment\") simultaneously offer at least two \"privileges\" to the public-that of watching the golf competition and that of competing in it. Although the latter is more difficult and more expensive to obtain than the former, it is nonetheless a privilege that petitioner makes available to members of the general public. In consideration of the entry fee, any golfer with the requisite letters of recommendation acquires the opportunity to qualify for and compete in petitioner's tours. Additionally, any golfer who succeeds in the open qualifying rounds for a tournament may play in the event. That petitioner identifies one set of clients or customers that it serves (spectators at tournaments) does not preclude it from having another set (players in tournaments) against whom it may not discriminate. It would be inconsistent with the literal text of the statute as well as its expansive purpose to read Title III's coverage, even given petitioner's suggested limitation, any less broadly.33~    ~    ~      32~      Our conclusion is consistent with case law in the analogous context of Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 243, 42 U.S.C.  2000a et seq. Title II of that Act prohibits public accommodations from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin. 2000a(a). In Daniel v. Paul, 395 U.S. 298, 306 (1969), applying Title II to the Lake Nixon Club in Little Rock, Arkansas, we held that the definition of a \"place of exhibition or entertainment,\" as a public accommodation, covered participants \"in some sport or activity\" as well as \"spectators or listeners.\" We find equally persuasive two lower court opinions applying Title II specifically to golfers and golf tournaments. In Evans v. Laurel Links, Inc., 261 F. Supp. 474, 477 (ED Va. 1966), a class action brought to require a commercial golf establishment to permit black golfers to play on its course, the District Court held that Title II \"is not limited to spectators if the place of exhibition or entertainment provides facilities for the public to participate in the entertainment.\"34 And in Wesley v. Savannah, 294 F. Supp. 698 (SD Ga. 1969), the District Court found that a private association violated Title II when it limited entry in a golf tournament on a municipal course to its own members but permitted all (and only) white golfers who paid the membership and entry fees to compete.35 These cases support our conclusion that, as a public accommodation during its tours and qualifying rounds, petitioner may not discriminate against either spectators or competitors on the basis of disability.~    ~    V~    ~      33~      As we have noted, 42 U.S.C.  12182(a) sets forth Title III's general rule prohibiting public accommodations from discriminating against individuals because of their disabilities. The question whether petitioner has violated that rule depends on a proper construction of the term \"discrimination,\" which is defined by Title III to include:~    ~    ~      34~      \"a failure to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, when such modifications are necessary to afford such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations to individuals with disabilities, unless the entity can demonstrate that making such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations.\" 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii) (emphasis added).~    ~    ~      35~      Petitioner does not contest that a golf cart is a reasonable modification that is necessary if Martin is to play in its tournaments. Martin's claim thus differs from one that might be asserted by players with less serious afflictions that make walking the course uncomfortable or difficult, but not beyond their capacity. In such cases, an accommodation might be reasonable but not necessary. In this case, however, the narrow dispute is whether allowing Martin to use a golf cart, despite the walking requirement that applies to the PGA TOUR, the NIKE TOUR, and the third stage of the Q-School, is a modification that would \"fundamentally alter the nature\" of those events.~    ~    ~      36~      In theory, a modification of petitioner's golf tournaments might constitute a fundamental alteration in two different ways. It might alter such an essential aspect of the game of golf that it would be unacceptable even if it affected all competitors equally; changing the diameter of the hole from three to six inches might be such a modification.36 Alternatively, a less significant change that has only a peripheral impact on the game itself might nevertheless give a disabled player, in addition to access to the competition as required by Title III, an advantage over others and, for that reason, fundamentally alter the character of the competition.37 We are not persuaded that a waiver of the walking rule for Martin would work a fundamental alteration in either sense.38~    ~    ~      37~      As an initial matter, we observe that the use of carts is not itself inconsistent with the fundamental character of the game of golf. From early on, the essence of the game has been shot-making-using clubs to cause a ball to progress from the teeing ground to a hole some distance away with as few strokes as possible.39 That essential aspect of the game is still reflected in the very first of the Rules of Golf, which declares: \"The Game of Golf consists in playing a ball from the teeing ground into the hole by a stroke or successive strokes in accordance with the rules.\" Rule 1-1, Rules of Golf, App. 104 (italics in original). Over the years, there have been many changes in the players' equipment, in golf course design, in the Rules of Golf, and in the method of transporting clubs from hole to hole.40 Originally, so few clubs were used that each player could carry them without a bag. Then came golf bags, caddies, carts that were pulled by hand, and eventually motorized carts that carried players as well as clubs. \"Golf carts started appearing with increasing regularity on American golf courses in the 1950's. Today they are everywhere. And they are encouraged. For one thing, they often speed up play, and for another, they are great revenue producers.\"41 There is nothing in the Rules of Golf that either forbids the use of carts, or penalizes a player for using a cart. That set of rules, as we have observed, is widely accepted in both the amateur and professional golf world as the rules of the game.42 The walking rule that is contained in petitioner's hard cards, based on an optional condition buried in an appendix to the Rules of Golf,43 is not an essential attribute of the game itself.~    ~    ~      38~      Indeed, the walking rule is not an indispensable feature of tournament golf either. As already mentioned, petitioner permits golf carts to be used in the SENIOR PGA TOUR, the open qualifying events for petitioner's tournaments, the first two stages of the Q-School, and, until 1997, the third stage of the Q-School as well. See supra, at 2-4. Moreover, petitioner allows the use of carts during certain tournament rounds in both the PGA TOUR and the NIKE TOUR. See supra, at 4, and n. 6. In addition, although the USGA enforces a walking rule in most of the tournaments that it sponsors, it permits carts in the Senior Amateur and the Senior Women's Amateur championships.44~    ~    ~      39~      Petitioner, however, distinguishes the game of golf as it is generally played from the game that it sponsors in the PGA TOUR, NIKE TOUR, and (at least recently) the last stage of the Q-School-golf at the \"highest level.\" According to petitioner, \"[t]he goal of the highest-level competitive athletics is to assess and compare the performance of different competitors, a task that is meaningful only if the competitors are subject to identical substantive rules.\"45 The waiver of any possibly \"outcome-affecting\" rule for a contestant would violate this principle and therefore, in petitioner's view, fundamentally alter the nature of the highest level athletic event.46 The walking rule is one such rule, petitioner submits, because its purpose is \"to inject the element of fatigue into the skill of shot-making,\"47 and thus its effect may be the critical loss of a stroke. As a consequence, the reasonable modification Martin seeks would fundamentally alter the nature of petitioner's highest level tournaments even if he were the only person in the world who has both the talent to compete in those elite events and a disability sufficiently serious that he cannot do so without using a cart.~    ~    ~      40~      The force of petitioner's argument is, first of all, mitigated by the fact that golf is a game in which it is impossible to guarantee that all competitors will play under exactly the same conditions or that an individual's ability will be the sole determinant of the outcome. For example, changes in the weather may produce harder greens and more head winds for the tournament leader than for his closest pursuers. A lucky bounce may save a shot or two.48 Whether such happenstance events are more or less probable than the likelihood that a golfer afflicted with Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome would one day qualify for the NIKE TOUR and PGA TOUR, they at least demonstrate that pure chance may have a greater impact on the outcome of elite golf tournaments than the fatigue resulting from the enforcement of the walking rule.~    ~    ~      41~      Further, the factual basis of petitioner's argument is undermined by the District Court's finding that the fatigue from walking during one of petitioner's 4-day tournaments cannot be deemed significant. The District Court credited the testimony of a professor in physiology and expert on fatigue, who calculated the calories expended in walking a golf course (about five miles) to be approximately 500 calories-\"nutritionally ... less than a Big Mac.\" 994 F. Supp., at 1250. What is more, that energy is expended over a 5-hour period, during which golfers have numerous intervals for rest and refreshment. In fact, the expert concluded, because golf is a low intensity activity, fatigue from the game is primarily a psychological phenomenon in which stress and motivation are the key ingredients. And even under conditions of severe heat and humidity, the critical factor in fatigue is fluid loss rather than exercise from walking.~    ~    ~      42~      Moreover, when given the option of using a cart, the majority of golfers in petitioner's tournaments have chosen to walk, often to relieve stress or for other strategic reasons.49 As NIKE TOUR member Eric Johnson testified, walking allows him to keep in rhythm, stay warmer when it is chilly, and develop a better sense of the elements and the course than riding a cart.50~    ~    ~      43~      Even if we accept the factual predicate for petitioner's argument-that the walking rule is \"outcome affecting\" because fatigue may adversely affect performance-its legal position is fatally flawed. Petitioner's refusal to consider Martin's personal circumstances in deciding whether to accommodate his disability runs counter to the clear language and purpose of the ADA. As previously stated, the ADA was enacted to eliminate discrimination against \"individuals\" with disabilities, 42 U.S.C.  12101(b)(1), and to that end Title III of the Act requires without exception that any \"policies, practices, or procedures\" of a public accommodation be reasonably modified for disabled \"individuals\" as necessary to afford access unless doing so would fundamentally alter what is offered, 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii). To comply with this command, an individualized inquiry must be made to determine whether a specific modification for a particular person's disability would be reasonable under the circumstances as well as necessary for that person, and yet at the same time not work a fundamental alteration. See S. Rep. No. 101-116, at 61; H. R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, at 102 (public accommodations \"are required to make decisions based on facts applicable to individuals\"). Cf. Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 483 (1999) (\"[W]hether a person has a disability under the ADA is an individualized inquiry\").~    ~    ~      44~      To be sure, the waiver of an essential rule of competition for anyone would fundamentally alter the nature of petitioner's tournaments. As we have demonstrated, however, the walking rule is at best peripheral to the nature of petitioner's athletic events, and thus it might be waived in individual cases without working a fundamental alteration. Therefore, petitioner's claim that all the substantive rules for its \"highest-level\" competitions are sacrosanct and cannot be modified under any circumstances is effectively a contention that it is exempt from Title III's reasonable modification requirement. But that provision carves out no exemption for elite athletics, and given Title III's coverage not only of places of \"exhibition or entertainment\" but also of \"golf course[s],\" 42 U.S.C.  12181(7)(C), (L), its application to petitioner's tournaments cannot be said to be unintended or unexpected, see 12101(a)(1), (5). Even if it were, \"the fact that a statute can be applied in situations not expressly anticipated by Congress does not demonstrate ambiguity. It demonstrates breadth.\" Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U.S., at 212 (internal quotation marks omitted).51~    ~    ~      45~      Under the ADA's basic requirement that the need of a disabled person be evaluated on an individual basis, we have no doubt that allowing Martin to use a golf cart would not fundamentally alter the nature of petitioner's tournaments. As we have discussed, the purpose of the walking rule is to subject players to fatigue, which in turn may influence the outcome of tournaments. Even if the rule does serve that purpose, it is an uncontested finding of the District Court that Martin \"easily endures greater fatigue even with a cart than his able-bodied competitors do by walking.\" 994 F. Supp., at 1252. The purpose of the walking rule is therefore not compromised in the slightest by allowing Martin to use a cart. A modification that provides an exception to a peripheral tournament rule without impairing its purpose cannot be said to \"fundamentally alter\" the tournament. What it can be said to do, on the other hand, is to allow Martin the chance to qualify for and compete in the athletic events petitioner offers to those members of the public who have the skill and desire to enter. That is exactly what the ADA requires.52 As a result, Martin's request for a waiver of the walking rule should have been granted.~    ~    ~      46~      The ADA admittedly imposes some administrative burdens on the operators of places of public accommodation that could be avoided by strictly adhering to general rules and policies that are entirely fair with respect to the able-bodied but that may indiscriminately preclude access by qualified persons with disabilities.53 But surely, in a case of this kind, Congress intended that an entity like the PGA not only give individualized attention to the handful of requests that it might receive from talented but disabled athletes for a modification or waiver of a rule to allow them access to the competition, but also carefully weigh the purpose, as well as the letter, of the rule before determining that no accommodation would be tolerable.~    ~    ~      47~      The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.~    ~    ~      48~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      49~      Scalia, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Thomas, J., joined.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         After the trial of the case, the name of the NIKE TOUR was changed to the Buy.com TOUR.~      ~      ~        2~         Generally, to maintain membership in a tour for the succeeding year, rather than go through the Q-School again, a player must perform at a certain level.~      ~      ~        3~         Instead, Appendix I to the Rules of Golf lists a number of \"optional\" conditions, among them one related to transportation: \"If it is desired to require players to walk in a competition, the following condition is suggested: \"Players shall walk at all times during a stipulated round.\" App. 125.~      ~      ~        4~         The PGA TOUR hard card provides: \"Players shall walk at all times during a stipulated round unless permitted to ride by the PGA TOUR Rules Committee.\" Id., at 127. The NIKE TOUR hard card similarly requires walking unless otherwise permitted. Id., at 129. Additionally, as noted, golf carts have not been permitted during the third stage of the Q-School since 1997. Petitioner added this recent prohibition in order to \"approximat[e] a PGA TOUR event as closely as possible.\" Id., at 152.~      ~      ~        5~         994 F.

Given the importance of the issue, we exercise our discretion to consider it. See Harris Trust and Sav. Bank v. Salomon Smith Barney Inc., 530 U.S. 238, 245-246, n. 2 (2000); Carlson v.

Unlike those who successfully apply for a job at a place of public accommodation, or those who successfully bid for a contract, the golfers who qualify for petitioner's tours play at their own pleasure (perhaps, but not necessarily, for prize money), and although they commit to playing in at least 15 tournaments, they are not bound by any obligations typically associated with employment. See, e.g., App. 260 (trial testimony of PGA commissioner Timothy Finchem) (petitioner lacks control over when and where tour members compete, and over their manner of performance outside the rules of competition). Furthermore, unlike athletes in \"other professional sports, such as baseball,\" post, at 7, in which players are employed by their clubs, the golfers on tour are not employed by petitioner or any related organizations. The record does not support the proposition that the purpose of the Q-School \"is to hire,\" ibid., rather than to narrow the field of participants in the sporting events that petitioner sponsors at places of public accommodation.~      ~      ~        34~         Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 includes in its definition of \"public accommodation\" a \"place of exhibition or entertainment\" but does not specifically list a \"golf course\" as an example. See 42 U.S.C.  2000a(b).~      ~      ~        35~         Under petitioner's theory, Title II would not preclude it from discriminating against golfers on racial grounds.

Whether one question should be decided before the others likely will vary from case to case, for in logic there seems to be no necessary priority among the three. In routine cases, the fundamental alteration inquiry may end with the question whether a rule is essential. Alternatively, the specifics of the claimed disability might be examined within the context of what is a reasonable or necessary modification. Given the concession by petitioner that the modification sought is reasonable and necessary, and given petitioner's reliance on the fundamental alteration provision, we have no occasion to consider the alternatives in this case.~      ~      ~        39~         Golf is an ancient game, tracing its ancestry to Scotland, and played by such notables as Mary Queen of Scots and her son James. That shot-making has been the essence of golf since early in its history is reflected in the first recorded rules of golf, published in 1744 for a tournament on the Leith Links in Edinburgh: \"Articles  Laws in Playing at Golf \"1. You must Tee your Ball, within a Club's length of the [previous] Hole. \"2. Your Tee must be upon the Ground. \"3. You are not to change the Ball which you Strike off the Tee. \"4.

At Holling, you are to play your Ball honestly for the Hole, and, not to play upon your Adversary's Ball, not lying in your way to the Hole. \"8.

Rather, a player's handicap is determined by a formula that takes into account the average score in the 10 best of her 20 most recent rounds, the difficulty of the different courses played, and whether or not a round was a \"tournament\" event.~      ~      ~        45~         Brief for Petitioner 13.~      ~      ~        46~         Id., at 37.~      ~      ~        47~         994 F. Supp., at 1250.~      ~      ~        48~         A drive by Andrew Magee earlier this year produced a result that he neither intended nor expected. While the foursome ahead of him was still on the green, he teed off on a 322-yard par four. To his surprise, the ball not only reached the green, but also bounced off Tom Byrum's putter and into the hole. Davis, Magee Gets Ace on Par-4, Ariz. Republic, Jan. 26 2001, p. C16, 2001 WL 8510792.~      ~      ~        49~         That has been so not only in the SENIOR PGA TOUR and the first two stages of the Q-School, but also, as Martin himself noticed, in the third stage of the Q-School after petitioner permitted everyone to ride rather than just waiving the walking rule for Martin as required by the District Court's injunction.~      ~      ~        50~         App. 201. See also id., at 179-180 (deposition testimony of Gerry Norquist); id., at 225-226 (trial testimony of Harry Toscano).~      ~      ~        51~         Hence, petitioner's questioning of the ability of courts to apply the reasonable modification requirement to athletic competition is a complaint more properly directed to Congress, which drafted the ADA's coverage broadly, than to us. Even more misguided is Justice Scalia's suggestion that Congress did not place that inquiry into the hands of the courts at all. According to the dissent, the game of golf as sponsored by petitioner is, like all sports games, the sum of its \"arbitrary rules,\" and no one, including courts, \"can pronounce one or another of them to be 'nonessential' if the rulemaker (here the PGA TOUR) deems it to be essential.\" Post, at 10-11. Whatever the merit of Justice Scalia's postmodern view of \"What Is [Sport],\" post, at 10, it is clear that Congress did not enshrine it in Title III of the ADA. While Congress expressly exempted \"private clubs or establishments\" and \"religious organizations or entities\" from Title III's coverage, 42 U.S.C.  12187 Congress made no such exception for athletic competitions, much less did it give sports organizations carte-blanche authority to exempt themselves from the fundamental alteration inquiry by deeming any rule, no matter how peripheral to the competition, to be essential. In short, Justice Scalia's reading of the statute renders the word \"fundamentally\" largely superfluous, because it treats the alteration of any rule governing an event at a public accommodation to be a fundamental alteration.~      ~      ~        52~         On this fundamental point, the dissent agrees. See post, at 9 (\"The PGA TOUR cannot deny respondent access to that game because of his disability\").~      ~      ~        53~         However, we think petitioner's contention that the task of assessing requests for modifications will amount to a substantial burden is overstated. As Martin indicates, in the three years since he requested the use of a cart, no one else has sued the PGA, and only two other golfers (one of whom is Olinger) have sued the USGA for a waiver of the walking rule. In addition, we believe petitioner's point is misplaced, as nowhere in 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii) does Congress limit the reasonable modification requirement only to requests that are easy to evaluate.~      ~    ~    Scalia, J., dissenting~    ~      50~      In my view today's opinion exercises a benevolent compassion that the law does not place it within our power to impose. The judgment distorts the text of Title III, the structure of the ADA, and common sense. I respectfully dissent.~    ~    ~      51~      * The Court holds that a professional sport is a place of public accommodation and that respondent is a \"custome[r]\" of \"competition\" when he practices his profession. Ante, at 17. It finds, ante, at 18, that this strange conclusion is compelled by the \"literal text\" of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U.S.C.  12101 et seq., by the \"expansive purpose\" of the ADA, and by the fact that Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.  2000a(a), has been applied to an amusement park and public golf courses. I disagree.~    ~    ~      52~      The ADA has three separate titles: Title I covers employment discrimination, Title II covers discrimination by government entities, and Title III covers discrimination by places of public accommodation. Title II is irrelevant to this case. Title I protects only \"employees\" of employers who have 15 or more employees, 12112(a), 12111(5)(A). It does not protect independent contractors. See, e.g., Birchem v. Knights of Columbus, 116 F.3d 310, 312-313 (CA8 1997); cf. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden, 503 U.S. 318, 322-323 (1992). Respondent claimed employment discrimination under Title I, but the District Court found him to be an independent contractor rather than an employee.~    ~    ~      53~      Respondent also claimed protection under 12182 of Title III. That section applies only to particular places and persons. The place must be a \"place of public accommodation,\" and the person must be an \"individual\" seeking \"enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations\" of the covered place. 12182(a). Of course a court indiscriminately invoking the \"sweeping\" and \"expansive\" purposes of the ADA, ante, at 13, 18, could argue that when a place of public accommodation denied any \"individual,\" on the basis of his disability, anything that might be called a \"privileg[e],\" the individual has a valid Title III claim. Cf. ante, at 14. On such an interpretation, the employees and independent contractors of every place of public accommodation come within Title III: The employee enjoys the \"privilege\" of employment, the contractor the \"privilege\" of the contract.~    ~    ~      54~      For many reasons, Title III will not bear such an interpretation. The provision of Title III at issue here (12182, its principal provision) is a public-accommodation law, and it is the traditional understanding of public-accommodation laws that they provide rights for customers. \"At common law, innkeepers, smiths, and others who made profession of a public employment, were prohibited from refusing, without good reason, to serve a customer.\" Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U.S. 557, 571 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). See also Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241 (1964). This understanding is clearly reflected in the text of Title III itself. Section 12181(7) lists 12 specific types of entities that qualify as \"public accommodations,\" with a follow-on expansion that makes it clear what the \"enjoyment of the goods, services, etc.\" of those entities consists of-and it plainly envisions that the person \"enjoying\" the \"public accommodation\" will be a customer. For example, Title III is said to cover an \"auditorium\" or \"other place of public gathering,\" 12181(7)(D). Thus, \"gathering\" is the distinctive enjoyment derived from an auditorium; the persons \"gathering\" at an auditorium are presumably covered by Title III, but those contracting to clean the auditorium are not. Title III is said to cover a \"zoo\" or \"other place of recreation,\" 12181(7)(I). The persons \"recreat[ing]\" at a \"zoo\" are presumably covered, but the animal handlers bringing in the latest panda are not. The one place where Title III specifically addresses discrimination by places of public accommodation through \"contractual\" arrangements, it makes clear that discrimination against the other party to the contract is not covered, but only discrimination against \"clients or customers of the covered public accommodation that enters into the contractual, licensing or other arrangement.\" 12182(b)(1)(A)(iv). And finally, the regulations promulgated by the Department of Justice reinforce the conclusion that Title III's protections extend only to customers. \"The purpose of the ADA's public accommodations requirements,\" they say, \"is to ensure accessibility to the goods offered by a public accommodation.\" 28 CFR, Ch. 1, pt. 36, App. B, p. 650 (2000). Surely this has nothing to do with employees and independent contractors.~    ~    ~      55~      If there were any doubt left that 12182 covers only clients and customers of places of public accommodation, it is eliminated by the fact that a contrary interpretation would make a muddle of the ADA as a whole. The words of Title III must be read \"in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\" Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 809 (1989). Congress expressly excluded employers of fewer than 15 employees from Title I. The mom-and-pop grocery store or laundromat need not worry about altering the nonpublic areas of its place of business to accommodate handicapped employees-or about the litigation that failure to do so will invite. Similarly, since independent contractors are not covered by Title I, the small business (or the large one, for that matter) need not worry about making special accommodations for the painters, electricians, and other independent workers whose services are contracted for from time to time. It is an entirely unreasonable interpretation of the statute to say that these exemptions so carefully crafted in Title I are entirely eliminated by Title III (for the many businesses that are places of public accommodation) because employees and independent contractors \"enjoy\" the employment and contracting that such places provide. The only distinctive feature of places of public accommodation is that they accommodate the public, and Congress could have no conceivable reason for according the employees and independent contractors of such businesses protections that employees and independent contractors of other businesses do not enjoy.~    ~    ~      56~      The United States apparently agrees that employee claims are not cognizable under Title III, see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 18-19, n. 17, but despite the implications of its own regulations, see 28 CFR, Ch. 1, pt. 36, App. B, p. 650 (2000), appears to believe (though it does not explicitly state) that claims of independent contractors are cognizable. In a discussion littered with entirely vague statements from the legislative history, cf. ante, at 12, the United States argues that Congress presumably wanted independent contractors with private entities covered under Title III because independent contractors with governmental entities are covered by Title II, see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 18, and n. 17-a line of reasoning that does not commend itself to the untutored intellect. But since the United States does not provide (and I cannot conceive of) any possible construction of the terms of Title III that will exclude employees while simultaneously covering independent contractors, its concession regarding employees effectively concedes independent contractors as well. Title III applies only to customers.~    ~    ~      57~      The Court, for its part, assumes that conclusion for the sake of argument, ante, at 17, but pronounces respondent to be a \"customer\" of the PGA TOUR or of the golf courses on which it is played. That seems to me quite incredible. The PGA TOUR is a professional sporting event, staged for the entertainment of a live and TV audience, the receipts from whom (the TV audience's admission price is paid by advertisers) pay the expenses of the tour, including the cash prizes for the winning golfers. The professional golfers on the tour are no more \"enjoying\" (the statutory term) the entertainment that the tour provides, or the facilities of the golf courses on which it is held, than professional baseball players \"enjoy\" the baseball games in which they play or the facilities of Yankee Stadium. To be sure, professional ballplayers participate in the games, and use the ballfields, but no one in his right mind would think that they are customers of the American League or of Yankee Stadium. They are themselves the entertainment that the customers pay to watch. And professional golfers are no different. It makes not a bit of difference, insofar as their \"customer\" status is concerned, that the remuneration for their performance (unlike most of the remuneration for ballplayers) is not fixed but contingent-viz., the purses for the winners in the various events, and the compensation from product endorsements that consistent winners are assured. The compensation of many independent contractors is contingent upon their success-real estate brokers, for example, or insurance salesmen.~    ~    ~      58~      As the Court points out, the ADA specifically identifies golf courses as one of the covered places of public accommodation. See 12181(7)(L) (\"a gymnasium, health spa, bowling alley, golf course, or other place of exercise or recreation\"); and the distinctive \"goo[d], servic[e], facilit[y], privileg[e], advantag[e], or accommodatio[n]\" identified by that provision as distinctive to that category of place of public accommodation is \"exercise or recreation.\" Respondent did not seek to \"exercise\" or \"recreate\" at the PGA TOUR events; he sought to make money (which is why he is called a professional golfer). He was not a customer buying recreation or entertainment; he was a professional athlete selling it. That is the reason (among others) the Court's reliance upon Civil Rights Act cases like Daniel v. Paul, 395 U.S. 298 (1969), see ante, at 18-19, is misplaced. A professional golfer's practicing his profession is not comparable to John Q. Public's frequenting \"a 232-acre amusement area with swimming, boating, sun bathing, picnicking, miniature golf, dancing facilities, and a snack bar.\" Daniel, supra, at 301.~    ~    ~      59~      The Court relies heavily upon the Q-School. It says that petitioner offers the golfing public the \"privilege\" of \"competing in the Q-School and playing in the tours; indeed, the former is a privilege for which thousands of individuals from the general public pay, and the latter is one for which they vie.\" Ante, at 14-15. But the Q-School is no more a \"privilege\" offered for the general public's \"enjoyment\" than is the California Bar Exam.1 It is a competition for entry into the PGA TOUR-an open tryout, no different in principle from open casting for a movie or stage production, or walk-on tryouts for other professional sports, such as baseball. See, e.g., Amateurs Join Pros for New Season of HBO's \"Sopranos,\" Detroit News, Dec. 22, 2000, p. 2 (20,000 attend open casting for \"The Sopranos\"); Bill Zack, Atlanta Braves, Sporting News, Feb. 6, 1995 (1,300 would-be players attended an open tryout for the Atlanta Braves). It may well be that some amateur golfers enjoy trying to make the grade, just as some amateur actors may enjoy auditions, and amateur baseball players may enjoy open tryouts (I hesitate to say that amateur lawyers may enjoy taking the California Bar Exam). But the purpose of holding those tryouts is not to provide entertainment; it is to hire. At bottom, open tryouts for performances to be held at a place of public accommodation are no different from open bidding on contracts to cut the grass at a place of public accommodation, or open applications for any job at a place of public accommodation. Those bidding, those applying-and those trying out-are not converted into customers. By the Court's reasoning, a business exists not only to sell goods and services to the public, but to provide the \"privilege\" of employment to the public; wherefore it follows, like night the day, that everyone who seeks a job is a customer.2~    ~    II~    ~      60~      Having erroneously held that Title III applies to the \"customers\" of professional golf who consist of its practitioners, the Court then erroneously answers-or to be accurate simply ignores-a second question. The ADA requires covered businesses to make such reasonable modifications of \"policies, practices, or procedures\" as are necessary to \"afford\" goods, services, and privileges to individuals with disabilities; but it explicitly does not require \"modifications [that] would fundamentally alter the nature\" of the goods, services, and privileges. 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii). In other words, disabled individuals must be given access to the same goods, services, and privileges that others enjoy. The regulations state that Title III \"does not require a public accommodation to alter its inventory to include accessible or special goods with accessibility features that are designed for, or facilitate use by, individuals with disabilities.\" 28 CFR  36.307 (2000); see also 28 CFR, ch. 1, pt. 36, App. B, p. 650 (2000). As one Court of Appeals has explained:~    ~    ~      61~      \"The common sense of the statute is that the content of the goods or services offered by a place of public accommodation is not regulated. A camera store may not refuse to sell cameras to a disabled person, but it is not required to stock cameras specially designed for such persons. Had Congress purposed to impose so enormous a burden on the retail sector of the economy and so vast a supervisory responsibility on the federal courts, we think it would have made its intention clearer and would at least have imposed some standards. It is hardly a feasible judicial function to decide whether shoestores should sell single shoes to one-legged persons and if so at what price, or how many Braille books the Borders or Barnes and Noble bookstore chains should stock in each of their stores.\" Doe v. Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co., 179 F.3d 557, 560 (CA7 1999).~    ~    ~      62~      Since this is so, even if respondent here is a consumer of the \"privilege\" of the PGA TOUR competition, see ante, at 14, I see no basis for considering whether the rules of that competition must be altered. It is as irrelevant to the PGA TOUR's compliance with the statute whether walking is essential to the game of golf as it is to the shoe store's compliance whether \"pairness\" is essential to the nature of shoes. If a shoe store wishes to sell shoes only in pairs it may; and if a golf tour (or a golf course) wishes to provide only walk-around golf, it may. The PGA TOUR cannot deny respondent access to that game because of his disability, but it need not provide him a game different (whether in its essentials or in its details) from that offered to everyone else.~    ~    ~      63~      Since it has held (or assumed) professional golfers to be customers \"enjoying\" the \"privilege\" that consists of PGA TOUR golf; and since it inexplicably regards the rules of PGA TOUR golf as merely \"policies, practices, or procedures\" by which access to PGA TOUR golf is provided, the Court must then confront the question whether respondent's requested modification of the supposed policy, practice, or procedure of walking would \"fundamentally alter the nature\" of the PGA TOUR game, 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii). The Court attacks this \"fundamental alteration\" analysis by asking two questions: first, whether the \"essence\" or an \"essential aspect\" of the sport of golf has been altered; and second, whether the change, even if not essential to the game, would give the disabled player an advantage over others and thereby \"fundamentally alter the character of the competition.\" Ante, at 20-21. It answers no to both.~    ~    ~      64~      Before considering the Court's answer to the first question, it is worth pointing out that the assumption which underlies that question is false. Nowhere is it writ that PGA TOUR golf must be classic \"essential\" golf. Why cannot the PGA TOUR, if it wishes, promote a new game, with distinctive rules (much as the American League promotes a game of baseball in which the pitcher's turn at the plate can be taken by a \"designated hitter\")? If members of the public do not like the new rules-if they feel that these rules do not truly test the individual's skill at \"real golf\" (or the team's skill at \"real baseball\") they can withdraw their patronage. But the rules are the rules. They are (as in all games) entirely arbitrary, and there is no basis on which anyone-not even the Supreme Court of the United States-can pronounce one or another of them to be \"nonessential\" if the rulemaker (here the PGA TOUR) deems it to be essential.~    ~    ~      65~      If one assumes, however, that the PGA TOUR has some legal obligation to play classic, Platonic golf-and if one assumes the correctness of all the other wrong turns the Court has made to get to this point-then we Justices must confront what is indeed an awesome responsibility. It has been rendered the solemn duty of the Supreme Court of the United States, laid upon it by Congress in pursuance of the Federal Government's power \"[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States,\" U.S. Const., Art. I, 8, cl. 3, to decide What Is Golf. I am sure that the Framers of the Constitution, aware of the 1457 edict of King James II of Scotland prohibiting golf because it interfered with the practice of archery, fully expected that sooner or later the paths of golf and government, the law and the links, would once again cross, and that the judges of this august Court would some day have to wrestle with that age-old jurisprudential question, for which their years of study in the law have so well prepared them: Is someone riding around a golf course from shot to shot really a golfer? The answer, we learn, is yes. The Court ultimately concludes, and it will henceforth be the Law of the Land, that walking is not a \"fundamental\" aspect of golf.~    ~    ~      66~      Either out of humility or out of self-respect (one or the other) the Court should decline to answer this incredibly difficult and incredibly silly question. To say that something is \"essential\" is ordinarily to say that it is necessary to the achievement of a certain object. But since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement (that is what distinguishes games from productive activity), it is quite impossible to say that any of a game's arbitrary rules is \"essential.\" Eighteen-hole golf courses, 10-foot-high basketball hoops, 90-foot baselines, 100-yard football fields-all are arbitrary and none is essential. The only support for any of them is tradition and (in more modern times) insistence by what has come to be regarded as the ruling body of the sport-both of which factors support the PGA TOUR's position in the present case. (Many, indeed, consider walking to be the central feature of the game of golf-hence Mark Twain's classic criticism of the sport: \"a good walk spoiled.\") I suppose there is some point at which the rules of a well-known game are changed to such a degree that no reasonable person would call it the same game. If the PGA TOUR competitors were required to dribble a large, inflated ball and put it through a round hoop, the game could no longer reasonably be called golf. But this criterion-destroying recognizability as the same generic game-is surely not the test of \"essentialness\" or \"fundamentalness\" that the Court applies, since it apparently thinks that merely changing the diameter of the cup might \"fundamentally alter\" the game of golf, ante, at 20.~    ~    ~      67~      Having concluded that dispensing with the walking rule would not violate federal-Platonic \"golf\" (and, implicitly, that it is federal-Platonic golf, and no other, that the PGA TOUR can insist upon) the Court moves on to the second part of its test: the competitive effects of waiving this nonessential rule. In this part of its analysis, the Court first finds that the effects of the change are \"mitigated\" by the fact that in the game of golf weather, a \"lucky bounce,\" and \"pure chance\" provide different conditions for each competitor and individual ability may not \"be the sole determinant of the outcome.\" Ante, at 25. I guess that is why those who follow professional golfing consider Jack Nicklaus the luckiest golfer of all time, only to be challenged of late by the phenomenal luck of Tiger Woods. The Court's empiricism is unpersuasive. \"Pure chance\" is randomly distributed among the players, but allowing respondent to use a cart gives him a \"lucky\" break every time he plays. Pure chance also only matters at the margin-a stroke here or there; the cart substantially improves this respondent's competitive prospects beyond a couple of strokes. But even granting that there are significant nonhuman variables affecting competition, that fact does not justify adding another variable that always favors one player.~    ~    ~      68~      In an apparent effort to make its opinion as narrow as possible, the Court relies upon the District Court's finding that even with a cart, respondent will be at least as fatigued as everyone else. Ante, at 28. This, the Court says, proves that competition will not be affected. Far from thinking that reliance on this finding cabins the effect of today's opinion, I think it will prove to be its most expansive and destructive feature. Because step one of the Court's two-part inquiry into whether a requested change in a sport will \"fundamentally alter [its] nature,\" 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii), consists of an utterly unprincipled ontology of sports (pursuant to which the Court is not even sure whether golf's \"essence\" requires a 3-inch hole), there is every reason to think that in future cases involving requests for special treatment by would-be athletes the second step of the analysis will be determinative. In resolving that second step-determining whether waiver of the \"nonessential\" rule will have an impermissible \"competitive effect\"-by measuring the athletic capacity of the requesting individual, and asking whether the special dispensation would do no more than place him on a par (so to speak) with other competitors, the Court guarantees that future cases of this sort will have to be decided on the basis of individualized factual findings. Which means that future cases of this sort will be numerous, and a rich source of lucrative litigation. One can envision the parents of a Little League player with attention deficit disorder trying to convince a judge that their son's disability makes it at least 25% more difficult to hit a pitched ball. (If they are successful, the only thing that could prevent a court order giving the kid four strikes would be a judicial determination that, in baseball, three strikes are metaphysically necessary, which is quite absurd.)~    ~    ~      69~      The statute, of course, provides no basis for this individualized analysis that is the Court's last step on a long and misguided journey. The statute seeks to assure that a disabled person's disability will not deny him equal access to (among other things) competitive sporting events-not that his disability will not deny him an equal chance to win competitive sporting events. The latter is quite impossible, since the very nature of competitive sport is the measurement, by uniform rules, of unevenly distributed excellence. This unequal distribution is precisely what determines the winners and losers-and artificially to \"even out\" that distribution, by giving one or another player exemption from a rule that emphasizes his particular weakness, is to destroy the game. That is why the \"handicaps\" that are customary in social games of golf-which, by adding strokes to the scores of the good players and subtracting them from scores of the bad ones, \"even out\" the varying abilities-are not used in professional golf. In the Court's world, there is one set of rules that is \"fair with respect to the able-bodied\" but \"individualized\" rules, mandated by the ADA, for \"talented but disabled athletes.\" Ante, at 29. The ADA mandates no such ridiculous thing. Agility, strength, speed, balance, quickness of mind, steadiness of nerves, intensity of concentration-these talents are not evenly distributed. No wild-eyed dreamer has ever suggested that the managing bodies of the competitive sports that test precisely these qualities should try to take account of the uneven distribution of God-given gifts when writing and enforcing the rules of competition. And I have no doubt Congress did not authorize misty-eyed judicial supervision of such a revolution.~    ~    ~      70~      * * *~    ~    ~      71~      My belief that today's judgment is clearly in error should not be mistaken for a belief that the PGA TOUR clearly ought not allow respondent to use a golf cart. That is a close question, on which even those who compete in the PGA TOUR are apparently divided; but it is a different question from the one before the Court. Just as it is a different question whether the Little League ought to give disabled youngsters a fourth strike, or some other waiver from the rules that makes up for their disabilities. In both cases, whether they ought to do so depends upon (1) how central to the game that they have organized (and over whose rules they are the master) they deem the waived provision to be, and (2) how competitive-how strict a test of raw athletic ability in all aspects of the competition-they want their game to be. But whether Congress has said they must do so depends upon the answers to the legal questions I have discussed above-not upon what this Court sententiously decrees to be \"decent, tolerant, [and] progressive,\" ante, at 13 (quoting Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 375 (2001) (Kennedy, J., concurring)).~    ~    ~      72~      And it should not be assumed that today's decent, tolerant, and progressive judgment will, in the long run, accrue to the benefit of sports competitors with disabilities. Now that it is clear courts will review the rules of sports for \"fundamentalness,\" organizations that value their autonomy have every incentive to defend vigorously the necessity of every regulation. They may still be second-guessed in the end as to the Platonic requirements of the sport, but they will assuredly lose if they have at all wavered in their enforcement. The lesson the PGA TOUR and other sports organizations should take from this case is to make sure that the same written rules are set forth for all levels of play, and never voluntarily to grant any modifications. The second lesson is to end open tryouts. I doubt that, in the long run, even disabled athletes will be well served by these incentives that the Court has created.~    ~    ~      73~      Complaints about this case are not \"properly directed to Congress,\" ante, at 27-28, n. 51. They are properly directed to this Court's Kafkaesque determination that professional sports organizations, and the fields they rent for their exhibitions, are \"places of public accommodation\" to the competing athletes, and the athletes themselves \"customers\" of the organization that pays them; its Alice in Wonderland determination that there are such things as judicially determinable \"essential\" and \"nonessential\" rules of a made-up game; and its Animal Farm determination that fairness and the ADA mean that everyone gets to play by individualized rules which will assure that no one's lack of ability (or at least no one's lack of ability so pronounced that it amounts to a disability) will be a handicap. The year was 2001, and \"everybody was finally equal.\" K.

But many independent contractors-composers of movie music, portrait artists, script writers, and even (some would say) plumbers-retain at least as much control over when and how they work as does respondent, who agrees to play in a minimum of 15 of the designated PGA TOUR events, and to play by the rules that the PGA TOUR specifies. Cf. Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 490 U.S. 730, 751-753 (1989) (discussing independent contractor status of a sculptor). Moreover, although, as the Court suggests in the same footnote, in rare cases a PGA TOUR winner will choose to forgo the prize money (in order, for example, to preserve amateur status necessary for continuing participation in college play) he is contractually entitled to the prize money if he demands it, which is all that a contractual relationship requires.~      ~    ~    ",

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD, PETITIONERv.KENTUCKY RIVER COMMUNITY CARE, INC., et al.~    No. 99-1815.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued February 21, 2001Decided May 29, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      When co-respondent labor union petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to represent a unit of employees at respondent's residential care facility, respondent objected to the inclusion of its registered nurses in the unit, arguing that they were \"supervisors\" under 2(11) of the National Labor Relations Act (Act), 15 U.S.C.  152(11), and hence excluded from the Act's protections. At the representation hearing, the Board's Regional Director placed the burden of proving supervisory status on respondent, found that respondent had not carried its burden, and included the nurses in the unit. Thereafter, respondent refused to bargain with the union, leading the Board's General Counsel to file an unfair labor practice complaint. The Board granted the General Counsel summary judgment on the basis of the representation determination, but the Sixth Circuit refused to enforce the Board's order. It rejected the Board's interpretation of \"independent judgment\" in 2(11)'s test for supervisory status, and held that the Board had erred in placing the burden of proving supervisory status on respondent.~      Held:   1. Respondent carries the burden of proving the nurses' supervisory status in the representation hearing and unfair labor practice proceeding. The Act does not expressly allocate the burden of proving or disproving supervisory status, but the Board has consistently placed the burden on the party claiming that the employee is a supervisor. That rule is both reasonable and consistent with Act, which makes supervisors an exception to the general class of employees. It is not contrary to the requirement that the Board must prove the elements of an unfair labor practice, because supervisory status is not an element of the Board's refusal-to-bargain charge. The Board must prove that the employer refused to bargain with the representative of a properly certified unit; the unit was not properly certified only if respondent successfully showed at the certification stage that some employees in the unit were supervisors. Pp. 3-6.~      2. The Board's test for determining supervisory status is inconsistent with the Act. The Act deems employees to be \"supervisors\" if they (1) exercise 1 of 12 listed supervisory functions, including \"responsibly direct[ing]\" other employees, (2) use \"independent judgment\" in exercising their authority, and (3) hold their authority in the employer's interest, 2(11). The Board rejected respondent's proof of supervisory status on the ground that employees do not use \"independent judgment\" under 2(11) when they exercise \"ordinary professional or technical judgment in directing less-skilled employees to deliver services in accordance with employer-specified standards.\" Brief for Petitioner 11. This interpretation, by distinguishing different kinds of judgment, introduces a categorical exclusion into statutory text that does not suggest its existence. The text permits questions regarding the degree of discretion an employee exercises, but the Board's interpretation renders determinative factors that have nothing to do with degree: even a significant judgment only loosely constrained by the employer will not be independent if it is \"professional or technical.\" The Board limits its categorical exclusion with a qualifier that is no less striking: only professional judgment applied in directing less skilled employees to deliver services is not \"independent judgment.\" Hence, the exclusion would apply to only 1 of the listed supervisory functions-\"responsibly to direct\"-though all 12 require using independent judgment. Contrary to the Board's contention, Congress did not incorporate the Board's categorical restrictions on \"independent judgment\" when it first added \"supervisor\" to the Act in 1947. The Board's policy concern regarding the proper balance of labor-management power cannot be given effect through this statutory text. Because this Court may not enforce the Board's order by applying a legal standard the Board did not adopt, NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U.S. 267, 289-290, the Board's error precludes the Court from enforcing its order. Pp. 6-15.~      193 F.3d 444, affirmed.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT~      Scalia, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court with respect to Part II, and the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and III, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ., joined.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      Under the National Labor Relations Act, employees are deemed to be \"supervisors\" and thereby excluded from the protections of the Act if, inter alia, they exercise \"independent judgment\" in \"responsibly ... direct[ing]\" other employees \"in the interest of the employer.\" 29 U.S.C.  152(11). This case presents two questions: which party in an unfair-labor-practice proceeding bears the burden of proving or disproving an employee's supervisory status; and whether judgment is not \"independent judgment\" to the extent that it is informed by professional or technical training or experience.~    ~    ~      2~      * In Pippa Passes, Kentucky, respondent Kentucky River Community Care, Inc., operates a care facility for residents who suffer from mental retardation and mental illness. The facility, named the Caney Creek Developmental Complex (Caney Creek), employs approximately 110 professional and nonprofessional employees in addition to roughly a dozen concededly managerial or supervisory employees. In 1997, the Kentucky State District Council of Carpenters (a labor union that is co-respondent here, supporting petitioner) petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to represent a single unit of all 110 potentially eligible employees at Caney Creek. See National Labor Relations Act (Act) 9(c), 49 Stat. 453, 29 U.S.C.  159(c).~    ~    ~      3~      At the ensuing representation hearing, respondent objected to the inclusion of Caney Creek's six registered nurses in the bargaining unit, arguing that they were \"supervisors\" under 2(11) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.  152(11), and therefore excluded from the class of \"employees\" subject to the Act's protection and includable in the bargaining unit. See 2(3), 29 U.S.C.  152(3). The Board's Regional Director, to whom the Board has delegated its initial authority to determine an appropriate bargaining unit, see 3(b), 29 U.S.C.  153(b); 29 CFR  101.21 (2000), placed the burden of proving supervisory status on respondent, found that respondent had not carried its burden, and therefore included the nurses in the bargaining unit. The Regional Director accordingly directed an election to determine whether the union would represent the unit. See 9(c)(1), 29 U.S.C.  159(c)(1). The Board denied respondent's request for review of the Regional Director's decision and direction of election, and the union won the election and was certified as the representative of the Caney Creek employees.~    ~    ~      4~      Because direct judicial review of representation determinations is unavailable, AFL v. NLRB, 308 U.S. 401, 409-411 (1940), respondent sought indirect review by refusing to bargain with the union, thereby inducing the General Counsel of the Board to file an unfair labor practice complaint under 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(5) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.  158(a)(1), (5). The Board granted summary judgment to the General Counsel pursuant to regulations providing that, absent newly developed evidence, the propriety of a bargaining unit may not be relitigated in an unfair labor practice hearing predicated on a challenge to the representation determination. 29 CFR  102.67(f) (2000); see Magnesium Casting Co. v. NLRB, 401 U.S. 137, 139-141 (1971) (approving that practice); Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v. NLRB, 313 U.S. 146, 161-162 (1941) (same).~    ~    ~      5~      Respondent petitioned for review of the Board's decision in the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, and the Board cross-petitioned. The Sixth Circuit granted respondent's petition as it applied to the nurses and refused to enforce the bargaining order. It held that the Board had erred in placing the burden of proving supervisory status on respondent rather than on its General Counsel, and it rejected the Board's interpretation of \"independent judgment,\" explaining that the Board had erred by classifying \"the practice of a nurse supervising a nurse's aide in administering patient care\" as \" 'routine' [simply] because the nurses have the ability to direct patient care by virtue of their training and expertise, not because of their connection with 'management.' \" 193 F.3d 444, 453 (1999). We granted the Board's petition for a writ of certiorari. 531 U.S. 1304 (2000).~    ~    II~    ~      6~      The Act expressly defines the term \"supervisor\" in 2(11), which provides: \"The term 'supervisor' means any individual having authority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively to recommend such action, if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment.\" 29 U.S.C.  152(11).~    ~    ~      7~      The Act does not, however, expressly allocate the burden of proving or disproving a challenged employee's supervisory status. The Board therefore has filled the statutory gap with the consistent rule that the burden is borne by the party claiming that the employee is a supervisor. For example, when the General Counsel seeks to attribute the conduct of certain employees to the employer by virtue of their supervisory status, this rule dictates that he bear the burden of proving supervisory status. See, e.g., Masterform Tool Co., 327 N. L. R. B. 1071, 1071-1072 (1999). Or, when a union challenges certain ballots cast in a representation election on the basis that they were cast by supervisors, the union bears the burden. See, e.g., Panaro and Grimes, 321 N. L. R. B. 811, 812 (1996).~    ~    ~      8~      The Board argues that the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit erred in not deferring to its resolution of the statutory ambiguity, and we agree. The Board's rule is supported by \"the general rule of statutory construction that the burden of proving justification or exemption under a special exception to the prohibitions of a statute generally rests on one who claims its benefits.\" FTC v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U.S. 37, 44-45 (1948). The Act's definition of \"employee,\" 2(3), 29 U.S.C.  152(3), \"reiterate[s] the breadth of the ordinary dictionary definition\" of that term, so that it includes \"any 'person who works for another in return for financial or other compensation.' \" NLRB v. Town  Country Elec., Inc., 516 U.S. 85, 90 (1995) (quoting American Heritage Dictionary 604 (3d ed. 1992)). Supervisors would fall within the class of employees, were they not expressly excepted from it. See Surenbhyph;Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467 U.S. 883, 891 (1984); cf. Packard Motor Car Co. v. NLRB, 330 U.S. 485 (1947). The burden of proving the applicability of the supervisory exception, under Morton Salt, should thus fall on the party asserting it. In addition, it is easier to prove an employee's authority to exercise 1 of the 12 listed supervisory functions than to disprove an employee's authority to exercise any of those functions, and practicality therefore favors placing the burden on the party asserting supervisory status. We find that the Board's rule for allocating the burden of proof is reasonable and consistent with the Act, and we therefore defer to it. NLRB v. Transportation Management Corp., 462 U.S. 393, 402-403 (1983).~    ~    ~      9~      Applying its rule to this case, the Board placed on respondent the duty to prove the supervisory status of its nurses both in the 9(c) representation proceeding, where respondent sought to exclude the nurses from the bargaining unit prior to the election, and in the unfair labor practice hearing, where respondent defended against the 8(a)(5) refusal-to-bargain charge. Respondent challenges the application of the rule to the latter proceeding where, it correctly observes and the Board does not dispute, \"the General Counsel carries the burden of proving the elements of an unfair labor practice,\" id., at 401, which means that it bears the burden of persuasion as well as of production, see Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.  556(d); Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Greenwich Collieries, 512 U.S. 267, 276-278 (1994) (rejecting statement to contrary in NLRB v. Transportation Management Corp., supra, at 404, n. 7). Supervisory status, however, is not an element of the Board's claim in this setting. The Board must prove that the employer refused to bargain with the representative of a unit of \"employees,\" 8(a)(5), 29 U.S.C.  158(a)(5), that was properly certified; the unit was not properly certified (as the respondent contends) only if the respondent successfully demonstrated, at the certification stage, that some employees in the unit were also supervisors. In the unfair labor practice proceeding, therefore, the burden remains on the employer to establish the excepted status of these nurses. Insofar as the Court of Appeals held otherwise, it erred. It remains to consider whether the court's other holding that is challenged here suffices to sustain its judgment.~    ~    III~    ~      10~      The text of 2(11) of the Act that we quoted above, 29 U.S.C.  152(11), sets forth a three-part test for determining supervisory status. Employees are statutory supervisors if (1) they hold the authority to engage in any 1 of the 12 listed supervisory functions, (2) their \"exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment,\" and (3) their authority is held \"in the interest of the employer.\" NLRB v. Health Care  Retirement Corp. of America, 511 U.S. 571, 573-574 (1994). The only basis asserted by the Board, before the Court of Appeals and here, for rejecting respondent's proof of supervisory status with respect to directing patient care was the Board's interpretation of the second part of the test-to wit, that employees do not use \"independent judgment\" when they exercise \"ordinary professional or technical judgment in directing less-skilled employees to deliver services in accordance with employer-specified standards.\" Brief for Petitioner 11. The Court of Appeals rejected that interpretation, and so do we.~    ~    ~      11~      Two aspects of the Board's interpretation are reasonable, and hence controlling on this Court, see NLRB v. Town  Country Elec., Inc., supra, at 89-90; Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-844 (1984). First, it is certainly true that the statutory term \"independent judgment\" is ambiguous with respect to the degree of discretion required for supervisory status. See NLRB v. Health Care  Retirement Corp. of America, supra, at 579. Many nominally supervisory functions may be performed without the \"exercis[e of] such a degree of ... judgment or discretion ... as would warrant a finding\" of supervisory status under the Act. Weyerhaeuser Timber Co., 85 N. L. R. B. 1170, 1173 (1949). It falls clearly within the Board's discretion to determine, within reason, what scope of discretion qualifies. Second, as reflected in the Board's phrase \"in accordance with employer-specified standards,\" it is also undoubtedly true that the degree of judgment that might ordinarily be required to conduct a particular task may be reduced below the statutory threshold by detailed orders and regulations issued by the employer. So, for example, in Chevron Shipping Co., 317 N. L. R. B. 379, 381 (1995), the Board concluded that \"although the contested licensed officers are imbued with a great deal of responsibility, their use of independent judgment and discretion is circumscribed by the master's standing orders, and the Operating Regulations, which require the watch officer to contact a superior officer when anything unusual occurs or when problems occur.\"~    ~    ~      12~      The Board, however, argues further that the judgment even of employees who are permitted by their employer to exercise a sufficient degree of discretion is not \"independent judgment\" if it is a particular kind of judgment, namely, \"ordinary professional or technical judgment in directing less-skilled employees to deliver services.\" Brief for Petitioner 11. The first five words of this interpretation insert a startling categorical exclusion into statutory text that does not suggest its existence. The text, by focusing on the \"clerical\" or \"routine\" (as opposed to \"independent\") nature of the judgment, introduces the question of degree of judgment that we have agreed falls within the reasonable discretion of the Board to resolve. But the Board's categorical exclusion turns on factors that have nothing to do with the degree of discretion an employee exercises. Cf. Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U.S. 457, 481 (2001) (\"[T]he agency's interpretation goes beyond the limits of what is ambiguous and contradicts what in our view is quite clear\"). Let the judgment be significant and only loosely constrained by the employer; if it is \"professional or technical\" it will nonetheless not be independent.1 The breadth of this exclusion is made all the more startling by virtue of the Board's extension of it to judgment based on greater \"experience\" as well as formal training. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 3 (\"professional or technical skill or experience\"). What supervisory judgment worth exercising, one must wonder, does not rest on \"professional or technical skill or experience\"? If the Board applied this aspect of its test to every exercise of a supervisory function, it would virtually eliminate \"supervisors\" from the Act. Cf. NLRB v. Yeshiva Univ., 444 U.S. 672, 687 (1980) (Excluding \"decisions ... based on ... professional expertise\" would risk \"the indiscriminate recharacterization as covered employees of professionals working in supervisory and managerial capacities\").~    ~    ~      13~      As it happens, though, only one class of supervisors would be eliminated in practice, because the Board limits its categorical exclusion with a qualifier: Only professional judgment that is applied \"in directing less-skilled employees to deliver services\" is excluded from the statutory category of \"independent judgment.\" Brief for Petitioner 11. This second rule is no less striking than the first, and is directly contrary to the text of the statute. Every supervisory function listed by the Act is accompanied by the statutory requirement that its exercise \"requir[e] the use of independent judgment\" before supervisory status will obtain, 152(11), but the Board would apply its restriction upon \"independent judgment\" to just 1 of the 12 listed functions: \"responsibly to direct.\" There is no apparent textual justification for this asymmetrical limitation, and the Board has offered none. Surely no conceptual justification can be found in the proposition that supervisors exercise professional, technical, or experienced judgment only when they direct other employees. Decisions \"to hire, ... suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, ... or discipline\" other employees, ibid., must often depend upon that same judgment, which enables assessment of the employee's proficiency in performing his job. See NLRB v. Yeshiva Univ., supra, at 686 (\"[M]ost professionals in managerial positions continue to draw on their special skills and training\"). Yet in no opinion that we were able to discover has the Board held that a supervisor's judgment in hiring, disciplining, or promoting another employee ceased to be \"independent judgment\" because it depended upon the supervisor's professional or technical training or experience. When an employee exercises one of these functions with judgment that possesses a sufficient degree of independence, the Board invariably finds supervisory status. See, e.g., Trustees of Noble Hospital, 218 N. L. R. B. 1441, 1442 (1975).~    ~    ~      14~      The Board's refusal to apply its limiting interpretation of \"independent judgment\" to any supervisory function other than responsibly directing other employees is particularly troubling because just seven years ago we rejected the Board's interpretation of part three of the supervisory test that similarly was applied only to the same supervisory function. See NLRB v. Health Care  Retirement Corp. of America, 511 U.S. 571 (1994). In Health Care, the Board argued that nurses did not exercise their authority \"in the interest of the employer,\" as 152(11) requires, when their \"independent judgment [was] exercised incidental to professional or technical judgment\" instead of for \"disciplinary or other matters, i.e., in addition to treatment of patients.\" Northcrest Nursing Home, 313 N. L. R. B. 491, 505 (1993). It did not escape our notice that the target of this analysis was the supervisory function of responsible direction. \"Under 2(11),\" we noted, \"an employee who in the course of employment uses independent judgment to engage in 1 of the 12 listed activities, including responsible direction of other employees, is a supervisor. Under the Board's test, however, a nurse who in the course of employment uses independent judgment to engage in responsible direction of other employees is not a supervisor.\" 511 U.S., at 578-579. We therefore rejected the Board's analysis as \"inconsistent with ... the statutory language,\" because it \"rea[d] the responsible direction portion of 2(11) out of the statute in nurse cases.\" Id., at 579-580. It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the Board's interpretation of \"independent judgment,\" applied to nurses for the first time after our decision in Health Care, has precisely the same object. This interpretation of \"independent judgment\" is no less strained than the interpretation of \"in the interest of the employer\" that it has succeeded.2 Cf. Allentown Mack Sales  Service, Inc. v. NLRB, 522 U.S. 359, 374 (1998) (an agency that announces one principle but applies another is not acting rationally under the Act).~    ~    ~      15~      The Board contends, however, that Congress incorporated the Board's categorical restrictions on \"independent judgment\" when it first added the term \"supervisor\" to the Act in 1947. We think history shows the opposite. The Act as originally passed by Congress in 1935 did not mention supervisors directly. It extended to \"employees\" the \"right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, [and] to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing ... .\" Act of July 5, 1935, 7, 49 Stat. 452, and it defined \"employee\" expansively (if circularly) to \"include any employee,\" 2(3). We therefore held that supervisors were protected by the Act. Packard Motor Car Co. v. NLRB, 330 U.S. 485 (1947). Congress in response added to the Act the exemption we had found lacking. The Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 (Taft-Hartley Act) expressly excluded \"supervisors\" from the definition of \"employees\" and thereby from the protections of the Act. 2(3), 61 Stat. 137, as amended, 29 U.S.C.  152(3) (\"The term 'employee' ... shall not include ... any individual employed as a supervisor\"); Taft-Hartley Act 14(a), as amended, 29 U.S.C.  164(a) (\"[N]o employer [covered by the Act] shall be compelled to deem individuals defined herein as supervisors as employees for the purposes of any law, either national or local, relating to collective bargaining\").~    ~    ~      16~      Well before the Taft-Hartley Act added the term \"supervisor\" to the Act, however, the Board had already been defining it, because while the Board agreed that supervisors were protected by the 1935 Act, it also determined that they should not be placed in the same bargaining unit as the employees they oversaw. To distinguish the two groups, the Board defined \"supervisors\" as employees who \"supervise or direct the work of [other] employees ... , and who have authority to hire, promote, discharge, discipline, or otherwise effect changes in the status of such employees.\" Douglas Aircraft Co., 50 N. L. R. B. 784, 787 (1943) (emphasis added). The \"and\" bears emphasis because it was a true conjunctive: The Board consistently held that employees whose only supervisory function was directing the work of other employees were not \"supervisors\" within its test. For example, in Bunting Brass  Bronze Co., 58 N. L. R. B. 618, 620 (1944), the Board wrote: \"We are of the opinion that, while linemen do direct the work of [other] employees, they do not exercise substantial supervisory authority within the usual meaning of that term.\" See also, e.g., Duval Texas Sulphur Co., 53 N. L. R. B. 1387, 1390-1391 (1943) (\"As to the chief electrician, motor mechanic, plant engineers, and drillers, ... [t]he fact that they work with helpers, and perforce direct and guide the work of their helpers, does not, of itself, elevate them to such supervisory rank that they must be excluded from the broad production and maintenance unit\").~    ~    ~      17~      When the Taft-Hartley Act added the term \"supervisor\" to the Act in 1947, it largely borrowed the Board's definition of the term, with one notable exception: Whereas the Board required a supervisor to direct the work of other employees and perform another listed function, the Act permitted direction alone to suffice. \"The term 'supervisor' means any individual having authority ... to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their grievances.\" Taft-Hartley Act 2(11), as amended, 29 U.S.C.  152(11) (emphasis added). Moreover, the Act assuredly did not incorporate the Board's current interpretation of the term \"independent judgment\" as applied to the function of responsible direction, since the Board had not yet developed that interpretation. It had had no reason to do so, because it had limited the category of supervisors more directly, by requiring functions in addition to responsible direction. It is the Act's alteration of precisely that aspect of the Board's jurisprudence that has pushed the Board into a running struggle to limit the impact of \"responsibly to direct\" on the number of employees qualifying for supervisory status-presumably driven by the policy concern that otherwise the proper balance of labor-management power will be disrupted.~    ~    ~      18~      It is upon that policy concern that the Board ultimately rests its defense of its interpretation of \"independent judgment.\" In arguments that parallel those expressed by the dissent in Health Care, see 511 U.S., at 588-590 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting), and which are adopted by Justice Stevens in this case, see post, at 5-6, the Board contends that its interpretation is necessary to preserve the inclusion of \"professional employees\" within the coverage of the Act. See 2(12), 29 U.S.C.  152(12). Professional employees by definition engage in work \"involving the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment.\" 152(12)(a)(ii). Therefore, the Board argues (enlisting dictum from our decision in NLRB v. Yeshiva Univ., 444 U.S., at 690, and n. 30, that was rejected in Health Care, see 511 U.S., at 581-582), if judgment of that sort makes one a supervisor under 152(11), then Congress's intent to include professionals in the Act will be frustrated, because \"many professional employees (such as lawyers, doctors, and nurses) customarily give judgment-based direction to the less-skilled employees with whom they work,\" Brief for Petitioner 33. The problem with the argument is not the soundness of its labor policy (the Board is entitled to judge that without our constant second-guessing, see, e.g., NLRB v. Curtin Matheson Scientific, Inc., 494 U.S. 775, 786 (1990)). It is that the policy cannot be given effect through this statutory text. See Health Care, supra, at 581 (\"[T]here may be 'some tension between the Act's exclusion of [supervisory and] managerial employees and its inclusion of professionals,' but we find no authority for 'suggesting that that tension can be resolved' by distorting the statutory language in the manner proposed by the Board\") (quoting NLRB v. Yeshiva Univ., supra, at 686). Perhaps the Board could offer a limiting interpretation of the supervisory function of responsible direction by distinguishing employees who direct the manner of others' performance of discrete tasks from employees who direct other employees, as 152(11) requires. Certain of the Board's decisions appear to have drawn that distinction in the past, see, e.g., Providence Hospital, 320 N. L. R. B. 717, 729 (1996). We have no occasion to consider it here, however, because the Board has carefully insisted that the proper interpretation of \"responsibly to direct\" is not at issue in this case, see Brief for Petitioner 21-22, n. 9; Reply Brief for Petitioner 7-8, n. 6.~    ~    ~      19~      What is at issue is the Board's contention that the policy of covering professional employees under the Act justifies the categorical exclusion of professional judgments from a term, \"independent judgment,\" that naturally includes them. And further, that it justifies limiting this categorical exclusion to the supervisory function of responsibly directing other employees. These contentions contradict both the text and structure of the statute, and they contradict as well the rule of Health Care that the test for supervisory status applies no differently to professionals than to other employees. 511 U.S., at 581. We therefore find the Board's interpretation unlawful. See Allentown Mack Sales  Service, Inc. v. NLRB, 522 U.S., at 364 (\"Courts must defer to the requirements imposed by the Board if they are 'rational and consistent with the Act,' and if the Board's 'explication is not inadequate, irrational or arbitrary' \" (citations omitted)).~    ~    ~      20~      * * *~    ~    ~      21~      We may not enforce the Board's order by applying a legal standard the Board did not adopt, NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U.S. 267, 289-290 (1974); SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 87-88 (1943), and, as we noted above, supra, at 6, the Board has not asked us to do so. Hence, the Board's error in interpreting \"independent judgment\" precludes us from enforcing its order. Our decision in Health Care, where the Board similarly had not asserted that its decision was correct on grounds apart from the one we rejected, see 511 U.S., at 584, simply affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals denying enforcement. Since that same condition applies here, see Brief for Petitioner 14; id., at 42, and since neither party has suggested that Health Care's method for determining the propriety of a remand should not apply here, we take the same course.3 \"Our conclusion that the Court of Appeals was correct to find the Board's test inconsistent with the statute ... suffices to resolve the case.\" Health Care, supra, at 584. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.~    ~    ~      22~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      23~      Stevens, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, in which Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         The Board in its reply brief in this Court steps back from this interpretation and argues that it has only drawn distinctions between degrees of authority. Reply Brief for Petitioner 3. But the opinions of the Board that developed its current interpretation of \"independent judgment\" clearly draw a categorical distinction. See, e.g., Providence Hospital, 320 N. L. R. B. 717, 729 (1996) (\"Section 2(11) supervisory authority does not include the authority of an employee to direct another to perform discrete tasks stemming from the directing employee's experience, skills, training, or position\"). It is those opinions that were cited in the Regional Director's opinion resolving the representation dispute, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a-53a, which was accepted without further review by the Board and was unreviewable in the unfair labor practice proceeding. \"We do not, of course, substitute counsel's post hoc rationale for the reasoning supplied by the Board itself.\" NLRB v. Yeshiva Univ., 444 U.S. 672, 685, n. 22 (1980) (citing SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196 (1947)).~      ~      ~        2~         Justice Stevens argues in this case, see post, at 4-5 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part), as the Board argued in NLRB v. Health Care  Retirement Corp. of America, 511 U.S. 571, 579 (1994), that the strain is eased by the ambiguity of a different term in the statute, \"responsibly to direct.\" That argument is no more persuasive now than when we rejected it in Health Care: \"[A]mbiguity in one portion of a statute does not give the Board license to distort other provisions of the statute,\" ibid.~      ~      ~        3~         Our decision in Health Care cannot be distinguished, as Justice Stevens suggests, see post, at 8, n. 10, on the ground that there we found that the Court of Appeals had not erred in any respect. The basis for remand to an agency is the agency's error on a point of law, not the reviewing court's. (That the reviewing court erred is irrelevant in light of \"the settled rule that, in reviewing the decision of a lower court, it must be affirmed if the result is correct 'although the lower court relied upon a wrong ground or gave a wrong reason,' \" SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 88 (1943) (quoting Helvering v. Gowran, 302 U.S. 238, 245 (1937))). And in Health Care, as here, the Board erred in interpreting the test for supervisory status.~      ~    ~    ~      24~      Opinion of Stevens, J.~    ~    ~      25~      In my opinion, the National Labor Relations Board correctly found that respondent, Kentucky River Community Care, Inc., failed to prove that the six registered nurses employed at its facility in Pippa Passes, Kentucky, are \"supervisors\" within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act. While we are unanimous in holding that the Court of Appeals set aside that finding based upon an incorrect allocation of the burden of proof, we disagree as to whether the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the Board misinterpreted the provision of the NLRA excluding supervisors from the Act's coverage. Moreover, even if I agreed with the majority's view that the Board's interpretation was error, that error would not justify affirming the erroneous decision of the Court of Appeals.~    ~    ~      26~      * In the proceedings before the Board, respondent relied heavily on the fact that two registered nurses (RNs) served as \"building supervisors\" on weekends, and on the second and third shifts. However, as the Regional Director who considered the evidence noted, the RNs received no extra compensation for serving as building supervisors and did not have keys to the facility. Instead, the only additional responsibility shouldered by the RNs when serving as building supervisors was that of contacting other employees if a shift was not fully staffed according to preestablished ratios not set by the RNs. However, the RNs had no authority to compel an employee to stay on duty or to come to work to fill a vacancy under threat of discipline.~    ~    ~      27~      With respect to the RNs' regular duties, while they might \"occasionally request other employees to perform routine tasks,\" they had no \"authority to take any action if the employee refuse[d] their directives.\"1 App. to Pet. for Cert. 51a. In their routine work, they had no \"authority to hire, fire, reward, promote, or independently discipline employees or to effectively recommend such action. They did not evaluate employees or take any action which would affect their employment status.\" Id., at 52a. Indeed, the RNs, even when serving as \"building supervisors,\" for the most part \"work[ed] independently and by themselves without any subordinates.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      28~      Based on his evaluation of the evidence, the NLRB's Regional Director applied \"the same test to registered nurses as is applicable to all other individuals in determining supervisory status.\" Ibid. Under that test, he concluded that \"only supervisory personnel vested with 'genuine management prerogatives' should be considered supervisors and not 'straw bosses, leadmen, set-up men and other minor supervisory employees.' \" Id., at 53a (quoting Chicago Metallic Corp., 273 N. L. R. B. 1677, 1688 (1985)). He did, however, exclude from the bargaining unit 10 specific supervisors including the nursing coordinator. App. to Pet. for Cert. 54a.~    ~    ~      29~      Over the dissent of Judge Jones, the Court of Appeals set aside the Board's order. The panel majority first criticized the Board for ignoring its \"repeated admonition\" that the NLRB \"has the burden of proving that employees are not supervisors.\" Id., at 15a. After acknowledging that \"whether an employee is a supervisor is a highly fact-intensive inquiry,\" that majority concluded that the RNs' duties as building supervisors involved \"independent judgment which is not limited to, or inherent in, the professional training of nurses.\" Id., at 18a-19a. The panel majority also criticized the NLRB for interpreting the admittedly ambiguous statutory term \"independent judgment\" inconsistently with Sixth Circuit precedent.2~    ~    II~    ~      30~      Although it is not necessary to do so to overturn the Court of Appeals' decision, the NLRB has asked us to reject the Sixth Circuit's interpretation of the term \"independent judgment.\" In contrast to the Sixth Circuit, the NLRB interprets the term \"independent judgment\" as not including the exercise of ordinary professional or technical judgment in directing less-skilled employees to deliver services in accordance with employer-specified standards.3 Providence Hospital and Alaska Nurses Assn., 320 N. L. R. B. 717 (1996), enforced, 121 F.3d 548 (CA9 1997); Nymed, Inc., 320 N. L. R. B. 806 (1996); see also, e.g., Graphics Typography, Inc., 217 N. L. R. B. 1047, 1053 (1975), enforced mem., 547 F.2d 1162 (CA3 1976). The Board's interpretation is a familiar one, which has been routinely applied in other employment contexts. See Providence, 320 N. L. R. B., at 717; Graphics Typography, 217 N. L. R. B., at 1053. Applying that interpretation, the NLRB has concluded that in some cases the employees in question are supervisors, and that in others they are not.4 See Brief for Petitioner, 17-19, nn. 5-7 (collecting cases); see also Brief for Respondent Kentucky State District Council of Carpenters 36, n. 16 (collecting cases).~    ~    ~      31~      The question before us is whether the Board's interpretation is both \"rational and consistent with the Act.\"5 NLRB v. Curtin Matheson Scientific, Inc., 494 U.S. 775, 796 (1990); see Fall River Dyeing  Finishing Corp. v. NLRB, 482 U.S. 27, 42 (1987). To my mind, the Board's test is both fully rational and entirely consistent with the Act.~    ~    ~      32~      The term \"independent judgment\" is indisputably ambiguous, and it is settled law that the NLRB's interpretation of ambiguous language in the National Labor Relations Act is entitled to deference.6 See NLRB v. Health Care and Retirement Corporation (HCR), 511 U.S. 571, 579 (1994); Auciello Iron Works, Inc. v. NLRB, 517 U.S. 781, 787-188 (1996); Curtin Matheson Scientific, Inc., 494 U.S., at 786-787. Such deference is particularly appropriate when the statutory ambiguity is compounded by the use of one ambiguous term-\"independent judgment\"-to modify another, equally ambiguous term-namely, \"responsibly to direct.\"~    ~    ~      33~      Moreover, since Congress has expressly provided that professional employees are entitled to the protection of the Act, there is good reason to resolve the ambiguities consistently with the Board's interpretation. At the same time that Congress acted to exclude supervisors from the NLRA's protection, it explicitly extended those same protections to professionals, who, by definition, engage in work that involves \"the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment in its performance.\"7 29 U.S.C.  152(12)(a)(ii). As this Court has acknowledged, the inclusion of professional employees and the exclusion of supervisors necessarily gives rise to some tension in the statutory text. Cf. NLRB v. Yeshiva Univ., 444 U.S. 672, 686 (1980). Accordingly, if the term \"supervisor\" is construed too broadly, without regard for the statutory context, then Congress' inclusion of professionals within the Act's protections is effectively nullified.8 See HCR, 511 U.S., at 585 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). In my opinion, the Court's approach does precisely what it accuses the Board of doing-namely, reading one part of the statute to the exclusion of the other.~    ~    ~      34~      The Court acknowledges today that deference is appropriate when the Board determines both the degree of discretion required for supervisory status as well as the significance of limitations on the alleged supervisor's discretion imposed by the employer. Thus, in a case like this, a court should not second-guess the Board's evaluation of the authority of the nurses as building supervisors, or of the significance of the employer's definition of that authority.~    ~    ~      35~      However, in a tour de force supported by little more than ipse dixit, the Court concludes that no deference is due the Board's evaluation of the \"kind of judgment\" that professional employees exercise. Ante, at 7. Thus, under the Court's view, it is impermissible for the Board to attach a different weight to a nurse's judgment that an employee should be reassigned or disciplined than to a nurse's judgment that the employee should take a patient's temperature, even if nurses routinely instruct others to take a patient's temperature but do not ordinarily reassign or discipline employees. The Court's approach finds no support in the text of the statute, and is inconsistent with our case law. See, e.g., Yeshiva, 444 U.S., at 690 (\"Only if an employee's activities fall outside of the scope of the duties routinely performed by similarly situated professionals will he be found aligned with management\").9~    ~    ~      36~      The Court further argues that the Board errs by not applying its limiting interpretation of the term \"independent judgment\" to all 12 functions identified by the statute as supervisory in nature. Ante, at 8-9. But of those 12, it is only \"responsibly to direct\" that is ambiguous and thus capable of swallowing the whole if not narrowly construed. The authority to \"promote\" or to \"discharge,\" to use only two examples, is specific and readily identifiable. In contrast, the authority \"responsibly to direct\" is far more vague. Thus, it is only logical for the term \"independent judgment\" to take on different contours depending on the nature of the supervisory function at issue and its comparative ambiguity.~    ~    ~      37~      Simply put, these are quintessential examples of terms that the expert agency should be allowed to interpret in the light of the policies animating the statute. See, e.g., Curtin Matheson, 494 U.S., at 786; Chevron U.S. A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984). Because the Board's interpretation is fully consistent both with the statutory text and with the policy favoring collective bargaining by professional employees, this Court is obligated to uphold it.~    ~    III~    ~      38~      Even if I shared the majority's view that the term \"independent judgment\" should be given the same meaning when applied to each of the 12 supervisory functions and when applied to professional and nonprofessional employees, I would not simply affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. Cf. NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U.S. 267, 289-290 (1974); SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 87-88 (1943). The Court's rejection of the Board's interpretation of the term \"independent judgment\" does not justify a categorical affirmance of the Sixth Circuit's decision, which rests in part on an erroneous allocation of the burden of proof.10~    ~    ~      39~      In any case, I do not agree with the majority's view. Given the Regional Director's findings that the RNs' duties as building supervisors do not qualify them as \"supervisors\" within the meaning of 29 U.S.C.  152(11), and that they, \"for the most part, work independently and by themselves without any subordinates,\" it is absolutely clear that the nurses in question are covered by the NLRA.11 The Court's willingness to treat them as supervisors even if they have no subordinates12 is particularly ironic when compared to the Board's undisturbed decision to deny supervisory status to the other group of professionals employed by respondent-namely, the 20 rehabilitation counselors who supervise the work of 40 rehabilitation assistants.~    ~    ~      40~      Accordingly, while I join Part II of the Court's opinion, I respectfully dissent from its holding. I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         The RNs did have the authority to file \"incident reports, but so [could] any other employee.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 51a.~      ~      ~        2~         \"According to NLRB interpretations, the practice of a nurse supervising a nurse's aide in administering patient care, for example, does not involve 'independent judgment.' The NLRB classifies these activities as 'routine' because the nurses have the ability to direct patient care by virtue of their training and expertise, not because of their connection with 'management.' \" App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a.~      ~      ~        3~         Oddly, the majority in this Court omits one element-namely, \"in accordance with employer-specified standards.\" Ante, at 8-9. In so doing, it ignores a key nuance in the NLRB's position. That, however, is characteristic of the majority's treatment of the NLRB's position, which is at once more fact specific and far less categorical than the majority makes it out to be.~      ~      ~        4~         The majority, however, pays scant heed to the adjudicative record when it asserts that the Board's interpretation would in essence eliminate the supervisory exception with respect to the \"responsibly to direct\" function. See ante, at 7-8.~      ~      ~        5~         \"[I]n many . . . contexts of labor policy, '[t]he ultimate problem is the balancing of the conflicting legitimate interests. The function of striking that balance to effectuate national labor policy is often a difficult and delicate responsibility, which the Congress committed primarily to the National Labor Relations Board, subject to limited judicial review.' \" Beth Israel Hospital v. NLRB, 437 U.S. 483, 501 (1978) (quoting NLRB v. Truck Drivers, 353 U.S. 87, 96 (1957)).~      ~      ~        6~         The majority suggests that the Board's interpretation of the term \"independent judgment\" is particularly problematic in light of this Court's decision in NLRB v. Health Care  Retirement Corp. of America, 511 U.S. 571 (1994) (HCR). But in HCR, this Court concluded that the terms \"independent judgment\" and \"responsibly to direct\" were ambiguous, while the term at issue in that case, \"in the interest of the employer,\" was not. Id., at 579.~      ~      ~        7~         As the American Nurses Association point out in its amicus brief, the scope of nursing practice routinely involves the exercise of judgment and the supervision of others. Brief for the American Nursing Association as Amicus Curiae 2-6.~      ~      ~        8~         Moreover, so broad a reading seems contrary to congressional intent in enacting the supervisory exception. Rather, the definition of \"supervisor\" was intended to apply only to those employees with \"genuine management prerogatives\" so that those employees excluded from the Act's coverage would be \"truly supervisory.\" S. Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 19 (1947), 1 NLRB, Legislative History of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, pp. 410, 425 (1948).~      ~      ~        9~         In fact, in Yeshiva, 444 U.S., at 690, this Court concluded that the NLRB's decisions adopting such an approach \"accurately capture[d] the intent of Congress.\"~      ~      ~        10~         Even under the Court's approach, since the NLRB might well prevail under the correct allocation of the burden of proof, the appropriate course of action in this case would be to return the case to the NLRB for further proceedings. See NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U.S. 267, 295 (1974); see also Electrical Workers v. NLRB, 366 U.S. 667 (1961); Ford Motor Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 364 (1939). HCR, on which the majority relies, see ante, at 15, is not to the contrary. In that case, unlike in this one, we found no error in the lower court's decision. Here, however, the lower court erred in its allocation of the burden of proof, a fact which would seem to make a remand to the NLRB in order to apply what the majority deems to be the correct legal principle particularly appropriate.~      ~      ~        11~         Nor do the RNs exercise any of the other supervisorial functions listed in 152(11). They play no role in assigning staff to shifts on a permanent basis or in setting the staff-to-resident ratio. App. 18-19, 23-24. As noted above, the RNs, whether functioning in their ordinary capacity or as \"building supervisors,\" do not have authority to hire, fire, reward, promote, or independently discipline employees, or to effectively recommend such action. Nor, for that matter, do they evaluate employees or take action that would affect their employment status.~      ~      ~        12~          Neither the licensed practical nurses nor the rehabilitation assistants report to the RNs.

CHURNER et al.~    No. 99-1964.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued March 20, 2001Decided May 29, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 amended 42 U.S.C.  1997e(a), which now requires a prisoner to exhaust \"such administrative remedies as are available\" before suing over prison conditions. Petitioner Booth was a Pennsylvania state prison inmate when he began this 42 U.S.C.  1983 action in Federal District Court, claiming that respondent corrections officers violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment by assaulting him, using excessive force against him, and denying him medical attention to treat ensuing injuries. He sought various forms of injunctive relief and money damages. At the time, Pennsylvania provided an administrative grievance and appeals system, which addressed Booth's complaints but had no provision for recovery of money damages. Before resorting to federal court, Booth filed an administrative grievance, but did not seek administrative review after the prison authority denied relief. Booth's failure to appeal administratively led the District Court to dismiss the complaint without prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under 1997e(a). The Third Circuit affirmed, rejecting Booth's argument that the exhaustion requirement is inapposite to his case because the administrative process could not award him the monetary relief he sought (money then being the only relief still requested).~      Held: Under 42 U.S.C.  1997e(a), an inmate seeking only money damages must complete any prison administrative process capable of addressing the inmate's complaint and providing some form of relief, even if the process does not make specific provision for monetary relief. The meaning of the phrase \"administrative remedies ... available\" is the crux of the case. Neither the practical considerations urged by the parties nor their reliance on the dictionary meanings of the words \"remedies\" and \"available\" are conclusive in seeking congressional intent. Clearer clues are found in two considerations. First, the broader statutory context in which Congress referred to \"available\" \"remedies\" indicates that exhaustion is required regardless of the relief offered through administrative procedures. While the modifier \"available\" requires the possibility of some relief for the action complained of, the word \"exhausted\" has a decidedly procedural emphasis. It makes no sense, for instance, to demand that someone exhaust \"such administrative [redress]\" as is available; one \"exhausts\" processes, not forms of relief, and the statute provides that one must. Second, statutory history confirms the suggestion that Congress meant to require procedural exhaustion regardless of the fit between a prisoner's prayer for relief and the administrative remedies possible. Before 1997e(a) was amended by the 1995 Act, a court had discretion (though no obligation) to require a state inmate to exhaust \"such ... remedies as are available,\" but only if they were \"plain, speedy, and effective.\" That scheme is now a thing of the past, for the amendments eliminated both the discretion to dispense with administrative exhaustion and the condition that the remedy be \"plain, speedy, and effective\" before exhaustion could be required. The significance of deleting that condition is apparent in light of McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140. In holding that the preamended version of 1997e(a) did not require exhaustion by those seeking only money damages when money was unavailable at the administrative level, id., at 149-151, the McCarthy Court reasoned in part that only a procedure able to provide money damages would be \"effective\" within the statute's meaning, id., at 150. It has to be significant that Congress removed the very term, \"effective,\" the McCarthy Court had previously emphasized in reaching the result Booth now seeks, and the fair inference to be drawn is that Congress meant to preclude the McCarthy result. Congress's imposition of an obviously broader exhaustion requirement makes it highly implausible that it meant to give prisoners a strong inducement to skip the administrative process simply by limiting prayers for relief to money damages not offered through administrative grievance mechanisms.

The question is whether an inmate seeking only money damages must complete a prison administrative process that could provide some sort of relief on the complaint stated, but no money. We hold that he must.~    ~    ~      2~      * Petitioner, Timothy Booth, was an inmate at the State Correctional Institution at Smithfield, Pennsylvania, when he began this action under Rev. Stat. 1979, 42 U.S.C.  1983 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. He claimed that respondent corrections officers at Smithfield violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment by assaulting him, bruising his wrists in tightening and twisting handcuffs placed upon him, throwing cleaning material in his face, and denying him medical attention to treat ensuing injuries. Booth sought various forms of injunctive relief, including transfer to another prison, as well as several hundred thousand dollars in money damages.~    ~    ~      3~      The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections provided an administrative grievance system at the time. It called for a written charge within 15 days of an event prompting an inmate's complaint, which was referred to a grievance officer for investigation and resolution. If any action taken or recommended was unsatisfactory to the inmate, he could appeal to an intermediate reviewing authority, with the possibility of a further and final appeal to a central review committee. App. 46-50. While the grievance system addressed complaints of the abuse and excessive force Booth alleged, it had no provision for recovery of money damages.1~    ~    ~      4~      Before resorting to federal court, Booth filed an administrative grievance charging at least some of the acts of abuse he later alleged in his action. Id., at 10-14. He did not, however, go beyond the first step, and never sought intermediate or final administrative review after the prison authority denied relief.~    ~    ~      5~      Booth's failure to avail himself of the later stages of the administrative process led the District Court to dismiss the complaint without prejudice for failure to exhaust \"administrative remedies ... available\" within the meaning of 42 U.S.C.  1997e(a) (1994 ed., Supp. V).

The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed, 206 F.3d 289 (2000), rejecting Booth's argument that the statutory exhaustion requirement is inapposite to his case simply because the State's administrative process could not award him the monetary relief he sought (money then being the only relief still requested, since Booth's transfer to another institution had mooted his claims for injunctive orders).2 Although the Third Circuit acknowledged that several other Courts of Appeals had held the exhaustion requirement subject to exception when the internal grievance procedure could not provide an inmate-plaintiff with the purely monetary relief requested in his federal action, see, e.g., Whitley v. Hunt, 158 F.3d 882 (CA5 1998); Lunsford v. Jumao-As, 155 F.3d 1178 (CA9 1998); Garrett v. Hawk, 127 F.3d 1263 (CA10 1997), the court found no such exception in the statute, 206 F.3d, at 299-300; accord, Freeman v. Francis, 196 F.3d 641 (CA6 1999); Alexander v. Hawk, 159 F.3d 1321 (CA11 1998). We granted certiorari to address this conflict among the Circuits, 531 U.S. 956 (2000), and we now affirm.~    ~    II~    ~      6~      In the aftermath of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995,3 42 U.S.C.  1997e(a) (1994 ed., Supp. V) provides that~    ~    ~      7~      \"[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\"~    ~    ~      8~      The meaning of the phrase \"administrative remedies ... available\" is the crux of the case, and up to a point the parties approach it with agreement. Neither of them denies that some redress for a wrong is presupposed by the statute's requirement of an \"available\" \"remed[y]\"; neither argues that exhaustion is required where the relevant administrative procedure lacks authority to provide any relief or to take any action whatsoever in response to a complaint.4 The dispute here, then, comes down to whether or not a remedial scheme is \"available\" where, as in Pennsylvania, the administrative process has authority to take some action in response to a complaint, but not the remedial action an inmate demands to the exclusion of all other forms of redress.~    ~    ~      9~      In seeking the congressional intent, the parties urge us to give weight to practical considerations, among others, and at first glance Booth's position holds some intuitive appeal. Although requiring an inmate to exhaust prison grievance procedures will probably obviate some litigation when the administrative tribunal can award at least some of the relief sought, Booth argues that when the prison's process simply cannot satisfy the inmate's sole demand, the odds of keeping the matter out of court are slim. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 16. The prisoner would be clearly burdened, while the government would obtain little or no value in return. The respondents, however, also have something to say. They argue that requiring exhaustion in these circumstances would produce administrative results that would satisfy at least some inmates who start out asking for nothing but money, since the very fact of being heard and prompting administrative change can mollify passions even when nothing ends up in the pocket. And one may suppose that the administrative process itself would filter out some frivolous claims and foster better-prepared litigation once a dispute did move to the courtroom, even absent formal factfinding. Although we have not accorded much weight to these possibilities in the past, see McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140, 155-156 (1992), Congress, as we explain below, may well have thought we were shortsighted. See infra, at 7-9. In any event, the practical arguments for exhaustion at least suffice to refute Booth's claim that no policy considerations justify respondents' position. The upshot is that pragmatism is inconclusive.~    ~    ~      10~      Each of the parties also says that the plain meaning of the words \"remedies\" and \"available\" in the phrase \"such administrative remedies ... available\" is controlling. But as it turns out both of them quote some of the same dictionary definitions of \"available\" \"remedies,\" and neither comes up with anything conclusive. Booth says the term \"remedy\" means a procedure that provides redress for wrong or enforcement of a right, and \"available\" means having sufficient power to achieve an end sought. See Brief for Petitioner 15-16 (citing Webster's Third New International Dictionary 150, 1920 (1993) (defining \"remedy\" as \"the legal means to recover a right or to prevent or obtain redress for a wrong\" and \"available\" as \"having sufficient power or force to achieve an end,\" \"capable of use for the accomplishment of a purpose,\" and that which \"is accessible or may be obtained\")). So far so good, but Booth then claims to be able to infer with particularity that when a prisoner demands money damages as the sole means to compensate his injuries, a grievance system without that relief offers no \"available\" \"remed[y].\" The general definitions, however, just do not entail such a specific conclusion.~    ~    ~      11~      It strikes us that the same definitions get the respondent corrections officers and their amicus the United States closer to firm ground for their assertion that the phrase \"such administrative remedies as are available\" naturally requires a prisoner to exhaust the grievance procedures offered, whether or not the possible responses cover the specific relief the prisoner demands. See Brief for Respondents 21. The United States tracks Booth in citing Webster's Third New International Dictionary to define \"remedy\" as \"the legal means to recover a right or to prevent or obtain redress for a wrong\" and \"available\" as \"capable of use for the accomplishment of a purpose.\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary, supra, at 150, 1920. But this exercise in isolated definition is ultimately inconclusive, for, depending on where one looks, \"remedy\" can mean either specific relief obtainable at the end of a process of seeking redress, or the process itself, the procedural avenue leading to some relief. See Black's Law Dictionary 1296 (7th ed. 1999) (defining \"remedy\" alternatively as \"[t]he means of enforcing a right or preventing or redressing a wrong,\" or as \"remedial action; ... Cf. relief\").~    ~    ~      12~      We find clearer pointers toward the congressional objective in two considerations, the first being the broader statutory context in which \"available\" \"remedies\" are mentioned. The entire modifying clause in which the words occur is this: \"until such administrative remedies as are available have been exhausted.\" The \"available\" \"remed[y]\" must be \"exhausted\" before a complaint under 1983 may be entertained. While the modifier \"available\" requires the possibility of some relief for the action complained of (as the parties agree), the word \"exhausted\" has a decidedly procedural emphasis. It makes sense only in referring to the procedural means, not the particular relief ordered. It would, for example, be very strange usage to say that a prisoner must \"exhaust\" an administrative order reassigning an abusive guard before a prisoner could go to court and ask for something else; or to say (in States that award money damages administratively) that a prisoner must \"exhaust\" his damages award before going to court for more. How would he \"exhaust\" a transfer of personnel? Would he have to spend the money to \"exhaust\" the monetary relief given him? It makes no sense to demand that someone exhaust \"such administrative [redress]\" as is available; one \"exhausts\" processes, not forms of relief, and the statute provides that one must.~    ~    ~      13~      A second consideration, statutory history, confirms the suggestion that Congress meant to require procedural exhaustion regardless of the fit between a prisoner's prayer for relief and the administrative remedies possible. Before 1997e(a) was amended by the Act of 1995, a court had discretion (though no obligation) to require a state inmate to exhaust \"such ... remedies as are available,\" but only if those remedies were \"plain, speedy, and effective.\" 42 U.S.C.  1997e(a) (1994 ed.). That scheme, however, is now a thing of the past, for the amendments eliminated both the discretion to dispense with administrative exhaustion and the condition that the remedy be \"plain, speedy, and effective\" before exhaustion could be required.~    ~    ~      14~      The significance of deleting that condition is apparent in light of our decision two years earlier in McCarthy v. Madigan, supra. In McCarthy, a federal inmate, much like Booth, sought only money damages against federal prison officials, and the Bureau of Prison's administrative procedure offered no such relief. Although 1997e(a) did not at that time apply to suits brought against federal officials, the government argued that the Court should create an analogous exhaustion requirement for Bivens actions. See Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). It proposed 1997e(a) as a model, on the assumption that the provision required exhaustion by those seeking nothing but money damages even when money was unavailable at the administrative level. We understood the effect of 1997e(a) to be quite different, however. See 503 U.S., at 149-151. In holding that exhaustion was not required, we reasoned in part from the language of 1997e(a) that required an \"effective\" administrative remedy as a precondition to exhaustion. Id., at 150. When a prisoner sought only money damages, we indicated, only a procedure able to provide money damages would be \"effective\" within the meaning of the statute. Ibid. (\"[I]n contrast to the absence of any provision for the award of money damages under the Bureau's general grievance procedure, the statute conditions exhaustion on the existence of 'effective administrative remedies' \"); see also id., at 156 (Rehnquist, C. J., joined by Scalia and Thomas, JJ., concurring in judgment) (\"[I]n cases ... where prisoners seek monetary relief, the Bureau's administrative remedy furnishes no effective remedy\").~    ~    ~      15~      When Congress replaced the text of the statute as construed in McCarthy with the exhaustion requirement at issue today, it presumably understood that under McCarthy the term \"effective\" in the former 1997e(a) eliminated the possibility of requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies when an inmate sought only monetary relief and the administrative process offered none. It has to be significant that Congress removed the very term we had previously emphasized in reaching the result Booth now seeks, and the fair inference to be drawn is that Congress meant to preclude the McCarthy result.5 Congress's imposition of an obviously broader exhaustion requirement makes it highly implausible that it meant to give prisoners a strong inducement to skip the administrative process simply by limiting prayers for relief to money damages not offered through administrative grievance mechanisms.~    ~    ~      16~      Thus, we think that Congress has mandated exhaustion clearly enough, regardless of the relief offered through administrative procedures.6 Cf. McCarthy, supra, at 144 (\"Where Congress specifically mandates, exhaustion is required\"). We accordingly affirm the judgment of the Third Circuit.~    ~    ~      17~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         The State has since modified its grievance scheme to permit awards of money. App. 60.~      ~      ~        2~         There is some uncertainty, probably stemming in part from the ambiguity of Booth's pro se filings in District Court, as to whether all of Booth's claims for relief other than money damages became moot when he was transferred. See Brief for Petitioner 12, n. 7; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 10, n. 2. We assume for present purposes that only Booth's claims for money damages remain.~      ~      ~        3~         110 Stat. 1321, as renumbered and amended.~      ~      ~        4~         Without the possibility of some relief, the administrative officers would presumably have no authority to act on the subject of the complaint, leaving the inmate with nothing to exhaust. The parties do not dispute that the state grievance system at issue in this case has authority to take some responsive action with respect to the type of allegations Booth raises.~      ~      ~        5~         This inference is, to say the least, also consistent with Congress's elimination of the requirement that administrative procedures must satisfy certain \"minimum acceptable standards\" of fairness and effectiveness before inmates can be required to exhaust them, and the elimination of courts' discretion to excuse exhaustion when it would not be \"appropriate and in the interests of justice.\" Compare 42 U.S.C.  1997e(a) (1994 ed., Supp. V) with 42 U.S.C.  1997e(a) (1994 ed.).~      ~      ~        6~         That Congress has mandated exhaustion in either case defeats the argument of Booth and supporting amici that this reading of 1997e (1994 ed., Supp. V) is at odds with traditional doctrines of administrative exhaustion, under which a litigant need not apply to an agency that has \"no power to decree ... relief,\" Reiter v. Cooper, 507 U.S. 258, 269 (1993), or need not exhaust where doing so would otherwise be futile. See Brief for Petitioner 24-27; Brief for Brennan Center for Justice et al. as Amici Curiae. Without getting into the force of this claim generally, we stress the point (which Booth acknowledges, see Reply Brief for Petitioner 4) that we will not read futility or other exceptions into statutory exhaustion requirements where Congress has provided otherwise. See McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140, 144 (1992); cf. Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749, 766-767 (1975). Here, we hold only that Congress has provided in 1997e(a) that an inmate must exhaust irrespective of the forms of relief sought and offered through administrative avenues.~      ~    ~    ",

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, PLAINTIFFv.STATE OF MAINE~    No. 130, Orig.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued April 16, 2001Decided May 29, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      New Hampshire and Maine share a border that runs from northwest to southeast. At the border's southeastern end, New Hampshire's easternmost point meets Maine's southernmost point. The boundary in this region follows the Piscataqua River eastward into Portsmouth Harbor and, from there, extends in a southeasterly direction into the sea. In 1977, in a dispute between the two States over lobster fishing rights, this Court entered a consent judgment setting the precise location of the States' \"lateral marine boundary,\" i.e., the boundary in the marine waters off the coast, from the closing line of Portsmouth Harbor five miles seaward. New Hampshire v. Maine, 426 U.S. 363; New Hampshire v. Maine, 434 U.S. 1, 2. The Piscataqua River boundary was fixed by a 1740 decree of King George II at the \"Middle of the River.\" See 426 U.S., at 366-367. In the course of litigation, the two States proposed a consent decree in which they agreed, inter alia, that the descriptive words \"Middle of the River\" in the 1740 decree refer to the middle of the Piscataqua River's main navigable channel. Rejecting the Special Master's view that the quoted words mean the geographic middle of the river, this Court accepted the States' interpretation and directed entry of the consent decree. Id., at 369-370. The final decree, entered in 1977, defined \"Middle of the River\" as \"the middle of the main channel of navigation of the Piscataqua River.\" 434 U.S., at 2. The 1977 consent judgment fixed only the lateral marine boundary and not the inland Piscataqua River boundary. In 2000, New Hampshire brought this original action against Maine, claiming on the basis of historical records that the inland river boundary runs along the Maine shore and that the entire Piscataqua River and all of Portsmouth Harbor belong to New Hampshire. Maine has filed a motion to dismiss, urging that the earlier proceedings bar New Hampshire's complaint.~      Held: Judicial estoppel bars New Hampshire from asserting that the Piscataqua River boundary runs along the Maine shore. Pp. 5-13.~      (a) Judicial estoppel is a doctrine distinct from the res judicata doctrines of claim and issue preclusion. Under the judicial estoppel doctrine, where a party assumes a certain position in a legal proceeding, and succeeds in maintaining that position, he may not thereafter, simply because his interests have changed, assume a contrary position, especially if it be to the prejudice of the party who has acquiesced in the position formerly taken by him. Davis v. Wakelee, 156 U.S. 680, 689. The purpose of the doctrine is to protect the integrity of the judicial process by prohibiting parties from deliberately changing positions according to the exigencies of the moment. Courts have recognized that the circumstances under which judicial estoppel may appropriately be invoked are not reducible to any general formulation. Nevertheless, several factors typically inform the decision whether to apply the doctrine in a particular case: First, a party's later position must be clearly inconsistent with its earlier position. Second, courts regularly inquire whether the party has succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party's earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create the perception that either the first or the second court was misled. Third, courts ask whether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped. In enumerating these factors, this Court does not establish inflexible prerequisites or an exhaustive formula for determining the applicability of judicial estoppel. Additional considerations may inform the doctrine's application in specific factual contexts. Pp. 5-8.~      (b) Considerations of equity persuade the Court that application of judicial estoppel is appropriate in this case. New Hampshire's claim that the Piscataqua River boundary runs along the Maine shore is clearly inconsistent with its interpretation of the words \"Middle of the River\" during the 1970's litigation to mean either the middle of the main navigable channel or the geographic middle of the river. Either construction located the \"Middle of the River\" somewhere other than the Maine shore of the Piscataqua River. Moreover, the record of the 1970's dispute makes clear that this Court accepted New Hampshire's agreement with Maine that \"Middle of the River\" means middle of the main navigable channel, and that New Hampshire benefited from that interpretation. Notably, in their joint motion for entry of the consent decree, New Hampshire and Maine represented to this Court that the proposed judgment was \"in the best interest of each State.\" Were the Court to accept New Hampshire's latest view, the risk of inconsistent court determinations would become a reality. The Court cannot interpret \"Middle of the River\" in the 1740 decree to mean two different things along the same boundary line without undermining the integrity of the judicial process. Pp. 8-9.~      (c) The Court rejects various arguments made by New Hampshire. The State urged at oral argument that the 1977 consent decree simply fixed the \"Middle of the River\" at an arbitrary location based on the parties' administrative convenience. But that view is foreclosed by the Court's determination that the consent decree proposed a wholly permissible final resolution of the controversy both as to facts and law, 426 U.S., at 368-369. The Court rejected the dissenters' view that the decree interpreted the middle-of-the-river language \"by agreements of convenience\" and not \"in accordance with legal principles,\" id., at 369. New Hampshire's contention that the 1977 consent decree was entered without a searching historical inquiry into what \"Middle of the River\" meant is refuted by the pleadings in the lateral marine boundary case and by this Court's independent determination that nothing suggests the location of the 1740 boundary agreed upon by the States is wholly contrary to relevant evidence, ibid. Nor can it be said that New Hampshire lacked the opportunity or incentive to locate the river boundary at Maine's shore. In its present complaint, New Hampshire relies on historical materials that were no less available in the 1970's than they are today. And New Hampshire had every reason to consult those materials: A river boundary running along Maine's shore would have resulted in a substantial amount of additional territory for New Hampshire. Pp. 9-11.~      (d) Also unavailing is New Hampshire's reliance on this Court's recognition that the doctrine of estoppel or that part of it which precludes inconsistent positions in judicial proceedings is ordinarily not applied to States, Illinois ex rel. Gordon v. Campbell, 329 U.S. 362, 369. This is not a case where estoppel would compromise a governmental interest in enforcing the law. Cf. Heckler v. Community Health Services of Crawford Cty., Inc., 467 U.S. 51, 60. Nor is this a case where the shift in the government's position results from a change in public policy, cf. Commissioner v. Sunnen, 333 U.S. 591, 601, or a change in facts essential to the prior judgment, cf. Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. 147, 159. Instead, it is a case between two States, in which each owes the other a full measure of respect. The Court is unable to discern any substantial public policy interest allowing New Hampshire to construe \"Middle of the River\" differently today than it did 25 years ago. Pp. 11-13.~      Motion to dismiss complaint granted.~      ON MOTION TO DISMISS COMPLAINT~      Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other Members joined, except Souter, J., who took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      The Piscataqua River lies at the southeastern end of New Hampshire's boundary with Maine. The river begins at the headwaters of Salmon Falls and runs seaward into Portsmouth Harbor (also known as Piscataqua Harbor). On March 6, 2000, New Hampshire brought this original action against Maine, claiming that the Piscataqua River boundary runs along the Maine shore and that the entire river and all of Portsmouth Harbor belong to New Hampshire. Maine has filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that two prior proceedings-a 1740 boundary determination by King George II and a 1977 consent judgment entered by this Court-definitively fixed the Piscataqua River boundary at the middle of the river's main channel of navigation.~    ~    ~      2~      The 1740 decree located the Piscataqua River boundary at the \"Middle of the River.\" Because New Hampshire, in the 1977 proceeding, agreed without reservation that the words \"Middle of the River\" mean the middle of the Piscataqua River's main channel of navigation, we conclude that New Hampshire is estopped from asserting now that the boundary runs along the Maine shore. Accordingly, we grant Maine's motion to dismiss the complaint.~    ~    ~      3~      * New Hampshire and Maine share a border that runs from northwest to southeast. At the southeastern end of the border, the easternmost point of New Hampshire meets the southernmost point of Maine. The boundary in this region follows the Piscataqua River eastward into Portsmouth Harbor and, from there, extends in a southeasterly direction into the sea. Twenty-five years ago, in a dispute between the two States over lobster fishing rights, this Court entered a consent judgment fixing the precise location of the \"lateral marine boundary,\" i.e., the boundary in the marine waters off the coast of New Hampshire and Maine, from the closing line of Portsmouth Harbor five miles seaward to Gosport Harbor in the Isles of Shoals. New Hampshire v. Maine, 426 U.S. 363 (1976); New Hampshire v. Maine, 434 U.S. 1, 2 (1977). This case concerns the location of the Maine-New Hampshire boundary along the inland stretch of the Piscataqua River, from the mouth of Portsmouth Harbor westward to the river's headwaters at Salmon Falls. (A map of the region appears as an appendix to this opinion.)~    ~    ~      4~      In the 1970's contest over the lateral marine boundary, we summarized the history of the interstate boundary in the Piscataqua River region. See New Hampshire v. Maine, 426 U.S., at 366-367. The boundary, we said, \"was in fact fixed in 1740 by decree of King George II of England\" as follows: \" 'That the Dividing Line shall pass up thro the Mouth of Piscataqua Harbour and up the Middle of the River ... . And that the Dividing Line shall part the Isles of Shoals and run thro the Middle of the Harbour between the Islands to the Sea on the Southerly Side... .' \" Id., at 366 (quoting the 1740 decree).~    ~    ~      5~      In 1976, New Hampshire and Maine \"expressly agree[d] ... that the decree of 1740 fixed the boundary in the Piscataqua Harbor area.\" Id., at 367 (internal quotation marks omitted). \"Their quarrel was over the location ... of the 'Mouth of Piscataqua River,' 'Middle of the River,' and 'Middle of the Harbour' within the contemplation of the decree.\" Ibid. The meaning of those terms was essential to delineating the lateral marine boundary. See Report of Special Master, O. T. 1975, No. 64 Orig., pp. 32-49 (hereinafter Report). In particular, the northern end of the lateral marine boundary required a determination of the point where the line marking the \"Middle of the [Piscataqua] River\" crosses the closing line of Piscataqua Harbor. Id., at 43.~    ~    ~      6~      In the course of litigation, New Hampshire and Maine proposed a consent decree in which they agreed, inter alia, that the words \"Middle of the River\" in the 1740 decree refer to the middle of the Piscataqua River's main channel of navigation. Motion for Entry of Judgment By Consent of Plaintiff and Defendant in New Hampshire v. Maine, O. T. 1973, No. 64 Orig., p. 2 (hereinafter Motion for Consent Judgment). The Special Master, upon reviewing pertinent history, rejected the States' interpretation and concluded that \"the geographic middle of the river and not its main or navigable channel was intended by the 1740 decree.\" Report 41. This Court determined, however, that the States' interpretation \"reasonably invest[ed] imprecise terms\" with a definition not \"wholly contrary to relevant evidence.\" New Hampshire v. Maine, 426 U.S., at 369. On that basis, the Court declined to adopt the Special Master's construction of \"Middle of the River\" and directed entry of the consent decree. Id., at 369-370. The final decree, entered in 1977, defined \"Middle of the River\" as \"the middle of the main channel of navigation of the Piscataqua River.\" New Hampshire v. Maine, 434 U.S., at 2.~    ~    ~      7~      The 1977 consent judgment fixed only the lateral marine boundary and not the inland Piscataqua River boundary. See Report 42-43 (\"For the purposes of the present dispute, ... it is unnecessary to lay out fully the course of the boundary as it proceeds upriver ... .\"). In the instant action, New Hampshire contends that the inland river boundary \"run[s] along the low water mark on the Maine shore,\" Complaint 49, and asserts sovereignty over the entire river and all of Portsmouth Harbor, including the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on Seavey Island located within the harbor just south of Kittery, Maine, id., at 34.* Relying on various historical records, New Hampshire urges that \"Middle of the River,\" as those words were used in 1740, denotes the main branch of the river, not a mid-channel boundary, Brief in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss 12-16, and that New Hampshire, not Maine, exercised sole jurisdiction over shipping and military activities in Portsmouth Harbor during the decades before and after the 1740 decree, id., at 17-19, and nn. 35-38.~    ~    ~      8~      While disagreeing with New Hampshire's understanding of history, see Motion to Dismiss 9-14, 18-19 (compiling evidence that Maine continually exercised jurisdiction over the harbor and shipyard from the 1700's to the present day), Maine primarily contends that the 1740 decree and the 1977 consent judgment divided the Piscataqua River at the middle of the main channel of navigation-a division that places Seavey Island within Maine's jurisdiction. Those earlier proceedings, according to Maine, bar New Hampshire's complaint under principles of claim and issue preclusion as well as judicial estoppel.~    ~    ~      9~      We pretermit the States' competing historical claims along with their arguments on the application vel non of the res judicata doctrines commonly called claim and issue preclusion. Claim preclusion generally refers to the effect of a prior judgment in foreclosing successive litigation of the very same claim, whether or not relitigation of the claim raises the same issues as the earlier suit. Issue preclusion generally refers to the effect of a prior judgment in foreclosing successive litigation of an issue of fact or law actually litigated and resolved in a valid court determination essential to the prior judgment, whether or not the issue arises on the same or a different claim. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments 17, 27, pp. 148, 250 (1980); D. Shapiro, Civil Procedure: Preclusion in Civil Actions 32, 46 (2001). In the unusual circumstances this case presents, we conclude that a discrete doctrine, judicial estoppel, best fits the controversy. Under that doctrine, we hold, New Hampshire is equitably barred from asserting-contrary to its position in the 1970's litigation-that the inland Piscataqua River boundary runs along the Maine shore.~    ~    II~    ~      10~      \"[W]here a party assumes a certain position in a legal proceeding, and succeeds in maintaining that position, he may not thereafter, simply because his interests have changed, assume a contrary position, especially if it be to the prejudice of the party who has acquiesced in the position formerly taken by him.\" Davis v. Wakelee, 156 U.S. 680, 689 (1895). This rule, known as judicial estoppel, \"generally prevents a party from prevailing in one phase of a case on an argument and then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in another phase.\" Pegram v. Herdrich, 530 U.S. 211, 227, n. 8 (2000); see 18 Moore's Federal Practice 134.30, p. 134-62 (3d ed. 2000) (\"The doctrine of judicial estoppel prevents a party from asserting a claim in a legal proceeding that is inconsistent with a claim taken by that party in a previous proceeding\"); 18 C. Wright, A. Miller,  E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure 4477, p. 782 (1981) (\"absent any good explanation, a party should not be allowed to gain an advantage by litigation on one theory, and then seek an inconsistent advantage by pursuing an incompatible theory\") (hereinafter Wright).~    ~    ~      11~      Although we have not had occasion to discuss the doctrine elaborately, other courts have uniformly recognized that its purpose is \"to protect the integrity of the judicial process,\" Edwards v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 690 F.2d 595, 598 (CA6 1982), by \"prohibiting parties from deliberately changing positions according to the exigencies of the moment,\" United States v. McCaskey, 9 F.3d 368, 378 (CA5 1993). See In re Cassidy, 892 F.2d 637, 641 (CA7 1990) (\"Judicial estoppel is a doctrine intended to prevent the perversion of the judicial process.\"); Allen v. Zurich Ins. Co., 667 F.2d 1162, 1166 (CA4 1982) (judicial estoppel \"protect[s] the essential integrity of the judicial process\"); Scarano v. Central R. Co., 203 F.2d 510, 513 (CA3 1953) (judicial estoppel prevents parties from \"playing 'fast and loose with the courts' \" (quoting Stretch v. Watson, 6 N. J. Super. 456, 469, 69 A. 2d 596, 603 (1949))). Because the rule is intended to prevent \"improper use of judicial machinery,\" Konstantinidis v. Chen, 626 F.2d 933, 938 (CADC 1980), judicial estoppel \"is an equitable doctrine invoked by a court at its discretion,\" Russell v. Rolfs, 893 F.2d 1033, 1037 (CA9 1990) (citation omitted).~    ~    ~      12~      Courts have observed that \"[t]he circumstances under which judicial estoppel may appropriately be invoked are probably not reducible to any general formulation of principle,\" Allen, 667 F.2d, at 1166; accord Lowery v. Stovall, 92 F.3d 219, 223 (CA4 1996); Patriot Cinemas, Inc. v. General Cinema Corp., 834 F.2d 208, 212 (CA1 1987). Nevertheless, several factors typically inform the decision whether to apply the doctrine in a particular case: First, a party's later position must be \"clearly inconsistent\" with its earlier position. United States v. Hook, 195 F.3d 299, 306 (CA7 1999); In re Coastal Plains, Inc., 179 F.3d 197, 206 (CA5 1999); Hossaini v. Western Mo. Medical Center, 140 F.3d 1140, 1143 (CA8 1998); Maharaj v. Bankamerica Corp., 128 F.3d 94, 98 (CA2 1997). Second, courts regularly inquire whether the party has succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party's earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create \"the perception that either the first or the second court was misled,\" Edwards, 690 F.2d, at 599. Absent success in a prior proceeding, a party's later inconsistent position introduces no \"risk of inconsistent court determinations,\" United States v. C. I. T. Constr. Inc., 944 F.2d 253, 259 (CA5 1991), and thus poses little threat to judicial integrity. See Hook, 195 F.3d, at 306; Maharaj, 128 F.3d, at 98; Konstantinidis, 626 F.2d, at 939. A third consideration is whether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped. See Davis, 156 U.S., at 689; Philadelphia, W.,  B. R. Co. v. Howard, 13 How. 307, 335-337 (1852); Scarano, 203 F.2d, at 513 (judicial estoppel forbids use of \"intentional self-contradiction ... as a means of obtaining unfair advantage\"); see also 18 Wright 4477, p. 782.~    ~    ~      13~      In enumerating these factors, we do not establish inflexible prerequisites or an exhaustive formula for determining the applicability of judicial estoppel. Additional considerations may inform the doctrine's application in specific factual contexts. In this case, we simply observe that the factors above firmly tip the balance of equities in favor of barring New Hampshire's present complaint.~    ~    ~      14~      New Hampshire's claim that the Piscataqua River boundary runs along the Maine shore is clearly inconsistent with its interpretation of the words \"Middle of the River\" during the 1970's litigation. As mentioned above, supra, at 3-4, interpretation of those words was \"necessary\" to fixing the northern endpoint of the lateral marine boundary, Report 43. New Hampshire offered two interpretations in the earlier proceeding-first agreeing with Maine in the proposed consent decree that \"Middle of the River\" means the middle of the main channel of navigation, and later agreeing with the Special Master that the words mean the geographic middle of the river. Both constructions located the \"Middle of the River\" somewhere other than the Maine shore of the Piscataqua River.~    ~    ~      15~      Moreover, the record of the 1970's dispute makes clear that this Court accepted New Hampshire's agreement with Maine that \"Middle of the River\" means middle of the main navigable channel, and that New Hampshire benefited from that interpretation. New Hampshire, it is true, preferred the interpretation of \"Middle of the River\" in the Special Master's report. See Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff in New Hampshire v. Maine, O. T. 1975, No. 64 Orig., p. 3 (hereinafter Plaintiff's Exceptions) (\"the boundary now proposed by the Special Master is more favorable to [New Hampshire] than that recommended in the proposed consent decree\"). But the consent decree was sufficiently favorable to New Hampshire to garner its approval. Although New Hampshire now suggests that it \"compromised in Maine's favor\" on the definition of \"Middle of the River\" in the 1970's litigation, Brief in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss 24, that \"compromise\" enabled New Hampshire to settle the case, see id., at 24-25, on terms beneficial to both States. Notably, in their joint motion for entry of the consent decree, New Hampshire and Maine represented to this Court that the proposed judgment was \"in the best interest of each State.\" Motion for Consent Judgment 1. Relying on that representation, the Court accepted the boundary proposed by the two States. New Hampshire v. Maine, 434 U.S. 1 (1977).~    ~    ~      16~      At oral argument, New Hampshire urged that the consent decree simply fixed the \"Middle of the River\" at \"an arbitrary location based on the administrative convenience of the parties.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 37. To the extent New Hampshire implies that the parties settled the lateral marine boundary dispute without judicial endorsement of their interpretation of \"Middle of the River,\" that view is foreclosed by the Court's determination that \"[t]he consent decree ... proposes a wholly permissible final resolution of the controversy both as to facts and law,\" New Hampshire v. Maine, 426 U.S., at 368-369. Three dissenting Justices agreed with New Hampshire that the consent decree interpreted the middle-of-the-river language \"by agreements of convenience\" and not \"in accordance with legal principles.\" Id., at 371 (White, J., dissenting, joined by Blackmun and Stevens, JJ.). But the Court concluded otherwise, noting that its acceptance of the consent decree involved \"[n]othing remotely resembling 'arbitral' rather than 'judicial' functions,\" id., at 369. The consent decree \"reasonably invest[ed] imprecise terms with definitions that give effect to [the 1740] decree,\" ibid., and \"[did] not fall into the category of agreements that we reject because acceptance would not be consistent with our Art. III function and duty,\" ibid.~    ~    ~      17~      New Hampshire also contends that the 1977 consent decree was entered without \"a searching historical inquiry into what that language ['Middle of the River'] meant.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 39. According to New Hampshire, had it known then what it knows now about the relevant history, it would not have entered into the decree. Ibid. We do not question that it may be appropriate to resist application of judicial estoppel \"when a party's prior position was based on inadvertence or mistake.\" John S. Clark Co. v. Faggert  Frieden, P. C., 65 F.3d 26, 29 (CA4 1995); see In re Corey, 892 F.2d 829, 836 (CA9 1989); Konstantinidis, 626 F.2d, at 939. We are unpersuaded, however, that New Hamsphire's position in 1977 fairly may be regarded as a product of inadvertence or mistake.~    ~    ~      18~      The pleadings in the lateral marine boundary case show that New Hampshire did engage in \"a searching historical inquiry\" into the meaning of \"Middle of the River.\" See Reply Brief for Plaintiff in New Hampshire v. Maine, O. T. 1975, No. 64 Orig., pp. 3-9 (examining history of river boundaries under international law, proceedings leading up to the 1740 order of the King in Council, and relevant precedents of this Court). None of the historical evidence cited by New Hampshire remotely suggested that the Piscataqua River boundary runs along the Maine shore. In fact, in attempting to place the boundary at the geographic middle of the river, New Hampshire acknowledged that its agents in 1740 understood the King's order to \"adjudg[e] half of the river to\" the portion of Massachusetts that is now Maine. Id., at 6 (emphasis in original) (quoting N. H. State Papers, XIX, pp. 591, 596-597); see id., at 4 (\"The intention of those participating in the proceedings leading to the [1740 decree] was to use 'geographic middle' as the Piscataqua boundary.\" (emphasis in original)). In addition, this Court independently determined that \"there is nothing to suggest that the location of the 1740 boundary agreed upon by the States is wholly contrary to relevant evidence.\" New Hampshire v. Maine, 426 U.S., at 369.~    ~    ~      19~      Nor can it be said that New Hampshire lacked the opportunity or incentive to locate the river boundary at Maine's shore. In its present complaint, New Hampshire relies on historical materials-primarily official documents and events from the colonial and postcolonial periods, see Brief in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss 12-19-that were no less available 25 years ago than they are today. And New Hampshire had every reason to consult those materials: A river boundary running along Maine's shore would have placed the northern terminus of the lateral marine boundary much closer to Maine, \"result[ing] in hundreds if not thousands of additional acres of territory being in New Hampshire rather than Maine,\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 48 (rebuttal argument of Maine). Tellingly, New Hampshire at the time understood the importance of placing the northern terminus as close to Maine as possible. While agreeing with the Special Master that \"Middle of the River\" means geographic middle, New Hampshire insisted that the geographic middle should be determined by using the banks of the river, not low tide elevations (as the Special Master had proposed), as the key reference points-a methodology that would have placed the northern terminus 350 yards closer to the Maine shore. Plaintiff's Exceptions 3.~    ~    ~      20~      In short, considerations of equity persuade us that application of judicial estoppel is appropriate in this case. Having convinced this Court to accept one interpretation of \"Middle of the River,\" and having benefited from that interpretation, New Hampshire now urges an inconsistent interpretation to gain an additional advantage at Maine's expense. Were we to accept New Hampshire's latest view, the \"risk of inconsistent court determinations,\" C. I. T. Construction, 944 F.2d, at 259, would become a reality. We cannot interpret \"Middle of the River\" in the 1740 decree to mean two different things along the same boundary line without undermining the integrity of the judicial process.~    ~    ~      21~      Finally, notwithstanding the balance of equities, New Hampshire points to this Court's recognition that \"ordinarily the doctrine of estoppel or that part of it which precludes inconsistent positions in judicial proceedings is not applied to states,\" Illinois ex rel. Gordon v. Campbell, 329 U.S. 362, 369 (1946). Of course, \"broad interests of public policy may make it important to allow a change of positions that might seem inappropriate as a matter of merely private interests.\" 18 Wright 4477, p. 784. But this is not a case where estoppel would compromise a governmental interest in enforcing the law. Cf. Heckler v. Community Health Services of Crawford Cty., Inc., 467 U.S. 51, 60 (1984) (\"When the Government is unable to enforce the law because the conduct of its agents has given rise to an estoppel, the interest of the citizenry as a whole in obedience to the rule of law is undermined. It is for this reason that it is well settled that the Government may not be estopped on the same terms as any other litigant.\"). Nor is this a case where the shift in the government's position is \"the result of a change in public policy,\" United States v. Owens, 54 F.3d 271, 275 (CA6 1995); cf. Commissioner v. Sunnen, 333 U.S. 591, 601 (1948) (collateral estoppel does not apply to Commissioner where pertinent statutory provisions or Treasury regulations have changed between the first and second proceeding), or the result of a change in facts essential to the prior judgment, cf. Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. 147, 159 (1979) (\"changes in facts essential to a judgment will render collateral estoppel inapplicable in a subsequent action raising the same issues\"). Instead, it is a case between two States, in which each owes the other a full measure of respect.~    ~    ~      22~      What has changed between 1976 and today is New Hampshire's interpretation of the historical evidence concerning the King's 1740 decree. New Hampshire advances its new interpretation not to enforce its own laws within its borders, but to adjust the border itself. Given Maine's countervailing interest in the location of the boundary, we are unable to discern any \"broad interes[t] of public policy,\" 18 Wright 4477, p. 784, that gives New Hampshire the prerogative to construe \"Middle of the River\" differently today than it did 25 years ago.~    ~    ~      23~      * * *~    ~    ~      24~      For the reasons stated, we conclude that judicial estoppel bars New Hampshire from asserting that the Piscataqua River boundary runs along the Maine shore. Accordingly, we grant Maine's motion to dismiss the complaint.~    ~    ~      25~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      26~      Justice Souter took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.~    ~    ~      27~      NOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLE.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        *~         According to New Hampshire, the Federal Government in recent years has taken steps to close portions of the shipyard and to lease its land and facilities to private developers. Complaint 34. New Hampshire and Maine assert competing claims of sovereignty over private development on shipyard lands. Ibid.~      ~    ~    ",

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.DALE G. BECKER, PETITIONERv.BETTY MONTGOMERY, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF OHIO, et al.~    No. 00-6374.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued April 16, 2001Decided May 29, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      Petitioner Becker, an Ohio prisoner, instituted a pro se civil rights action contesting conditions of his confinement under 42 U.S.C.  1983. The Federal District Court dismissed his complaint for failure to exhaust prison administrative remedies and failure to state a claim for relief. Within the 30 days allowed for appeal from a district court's judgment, see 28 U.S.C.  2107(a); Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(1), Becker, still pro se, filed a notice of appeal using a Government-printed form on which he filled in all of the requested information. On the line tagged \"(Counsel for Appellant),\" Becker typed, but did not hand sign, his own name. The form contained no indication of a signature requirement. The District Court docketed the notice, sent a copy to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, and subsequently granted Becker leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal. The Sixth Circuit Clerk's Office sent Becker a letter telling him that his appeal had been docketed, setting a briefing schedule, and stating that the court would not hold him to the same standards it required of attorneys in stating his case. Becker filed his brief in advance of the scheduled deadline, signing it on both the cover and the last page. Long after the 30-day time to appeal had expired, the Sixth Circuit dismissed the appeal on its own motion, holding, in reliance on its prior Mattingly decision, that the notice of appeal was fatally defective because it was not signed. The Court of Appeals deemed the defect \"jurisdictional,\" and therefore not curable outside the time allowed to file the notice. No court officer had earlier called Becker's attention to the need for a signature.~      Held: When a party files a timely notice of appeal in district court, the failure to sign the notice does not require the court of appeals to dismiss the appeal. Pp. 4-10.~      (a) The Sixth Circuit based its Mattingly determination on the complementary operation of two Federal Rules: Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure (Appellate Rule) 4(a)(1), which provides that \"the notice of appeal required by Rule 3 [to commence an appeal] must be filed with the district clerk within 30 days after the judgment ... appealed from is entered\"; and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (Civil Rule) 11(a), which provides that \"[e]very pleading, written motion, and other paper [filed in a district court] shall be signed\" by counsel or, if the party is unrepresented, by the party himself. P. 4.~      (b) The Sixth Circuit is correct that the governing Federal Rules call for a signature on notices of appeal. Civil Rule 11(a), the signature requirement's source, comes into play on appeal this way. An appeal can be initiated, Appellate Rule 3(a)(1) instructs, \"only by filing a notice of appeal with the district clerk within the time allowed by [Appellate] Rule 4.\" Whenever the Appellate Rules provide for a filing in the district court, Appellate Rule 1(a)(2) directs, \"the procedure must comply with the practice of the district court.\" The district court practice relevant here is Civil Rule 11(a)'s signature requirement. Notices of appeal unquestionably qualify as \"other paper[s]\" under that requirement, so they \"shall be signed.\" Without a rule change so ordering, the Court is not disposed to extend the meaning of the word \"signed\" to permit typed names, as Becker urges. Rather, the Court reads Civil Rule 11(a) to call for a name handwritten (or a mark handplaced). Pp. 4-6.~      (c) However, the Sixth Circuit erred in its dispositive ruling that the signature requirement cannot be met after the appeal period expires. As plainly as Civil Rule 11(a) requires a signature on filed papers, so the rule goes on to provide that \"omission of the signature\" may be \"corrected promptly after being called to the attention of the attorney or party.\" Corrections can be made, the Rules Advisory Committee noted, by signing the paper on file or by submitting a duplicate that contains the signature. Civil Rule 11(a)'s provision for correction applies to appeal notices. The rule was formulated and should be applied as a cohesive whole. So understood, the signature requirement and the cure for an initial failure to meet the requirement go hand in hand. Becker proffered a correction of the defect in his notice in the manner Rule 11(a) permits-he attempted to submit a duplicate containing his signature-and therefore should not have suffered dismissal of his appeal for nonobservance of that rule. The Court does not disturb its earlier statements describing Appellate Rules 3 and 4 as \"jurisdictional in nature.\" E.g., Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487 U.S. 312, 315. The Court rules simply and only that Becker's lapse was curable as Civil Rule 11(a) prescribes; his initial omission was not a \"jurisdictional\" impediment to pursuit of his appeal. While Appellate Rules 3 and 4 are indeed linked jurisdictional provisions, Rule 3(c)(1), which details what the notice of appeal must contain, does not include a signature requirement. Civil Rule 11(a) alone calls for and controls that requirement and renders it nonjurisdictional. Pp. 6-8.~      (d) The Court rejects the argument that, even if there is no jurisdictional notice of appeal signature requirement for parties represented by attorneys, pro se parties, like Becker, must sign within Rule 4's time line to avoid automatic dismissal. The foundation for this argument is Appellate Rule 3(c)(2), which reads: \"A pro se notice of appeal is considered filed on behalf of the signer and the signer's spouse and minor children (if they are parties), unless the notice clearly indicates otherwise.\" That provision does not dislodge the signature requirement from its Civil Rule 11(a) moorings and make of it an Appellate Rule 3 jurisdictional specification. Rather, Rule 3(c)(2) is entirely ameliorative; it assumes and assures that the pro se litigant's spouse and minor children, if they were parties below, will remain parties on appeal, unless the notice clearly indicates a contrary intent. This reading of Rule 3(c)(2) is in harmony with a related ameliorative rule, Appellate Rule 3(c)(4), which provides: \"An appeal must not be dismissed for informality of form or title of the notice of appeal, or for failure to name a party whose intent to appeal is otherwise clear from the notice.\" Imperfections in noticing an appeal should not be fatal where no genuine doubt exists about who is appealing, from what judgment, to which appellate court. See, e.g., Smith v. Barry, 502 U.S. 244, 245, 248-249. Pp. 8-10.~      Reversed and remanded.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT~      Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      Petitioner Dale G. Becker, an Ohio prisoner, instituted a pro se civil rights action in a Federal District Court, contesting conditions of his confinement. Upon dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim for relief, Becker sought to appeal. Using a Government-printed form, Becker timely filed a notice of appeal that contained all of the requested information. On the line tagged \"(Counsel for Appellant),\" Becker typed, but did not hand sign, his own name. For want of a handwritten signature on the notice as originally filed, the Court of Appeals dismissed Becker's appeal. The appellate court deemed the defect \"jurisdictional,\" and therefore not curable outside the time allowed to file the notice.~    ~    ~      2~      We granted review to address this question: \"When a party files a timely notice of appeal in district court, does the failure to sign the notice of appeal require the court of appeals to dismiss the appeal?\" 531 U.S. 1110 (2001). Our answer is no. For want of a signature on a timely notice, the appeal is not automatically lost. The governing Federal Rules direct that the notice of appeal, like other papers filed in district court, shall be signed by counsel or, if the party is unrepresented, by the party himself. But if the notice is timely filed and adequate in other respects, jurisdiction will vest in the court of appeals, where the case may proceed so long as the appellant promptly supplies the signature once the omission is called to his attention.~    ~    ~      3~      * This case originated from a civil rights complaint under 42 U.S.C.  1983 filed pro se by Ohio prison inmate Dale G. Becker in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. Becker challenged the conditions of his incarceration at the Chillicothe Correctional Institution, specifically, his exposure to second-hand cigarette smoke. The District Court dismissed Becker's complaint for failure to exhaust prison administrative remedies and failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. App. 5-8.~    ~    ~      4~      Within the 30 days allowed for appeal from a district court's judgment, see 28 U.S.C.  2107(a); Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(1), Becker, still pro se, filed a notice of appeal. Using a notice of appeal form printed by the Government Printing Office, Becker filled in the blanks, specifying himself as sole appellant, designating the judgment from which he appealed, and naming the court to which he appealed. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 3(c)(1). He typed his own name in the space above \"(Counsel for Appellant),\" and also typed, in the spaces provided on the form, his address and the date of the notice. The form Becker completed contained no statement or other indication of a signature requirement and Becker did not hand sign the notice.~    ~    ~      5~      The District Court docketed the notice, sent a copy to the Court of Appeals, and subsequently granted Becker leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal. Becker received a letter from the Sixth Circuit Clerk's Office telling him that his appeal had been docketed and setting a briefing schedule. The letter stated: \"The court is aware that you are not an attorney and it will not hold you to the same standards it requires of them in stating your case.\" App. 14.~    ~    ~      6~      Becker filed his brief more than two weeks in advance of the scheduled deadline. He signed it both on the cover and on the last page. Some six months later, on its own motion, the Sixth Circuit dismissed the appeal in a spare order relying on that court's prior, published decision in Mattingly v. Farmers State Bank, 153 F.3d 336 (1998) (per curiam). In Becker's case, the Court of Appeals said, summarily:~    ~    ~      7~      \"This court lacks jurisdiction over this appeal. The notice of appeal is defective because it was not signed by the pro se appellant or by a qualified attorney.\" App. 16-17.~    ~    ~      8~      No court officer had earlier called Becker's attention to the need for a signature, and the dismissal order, issued long after the 30-day time to appeal expired, accorded Becker no opportunity to cure the defect.~    ~    ~      9~      Becker filed a timely but unsuccessful motion for reconsideration, to which he appended a new, signed notice of appeal. Thereafter, he petitioned for this Court's review. The Attorney General of Ohio, in response, urged us \"to summarily reverse the judgment below,\" Brief in Response to Pet. for Cert. 1, stating:~    ~    ~      10~      \"We cannot honestly claim any uncertain[t]y about petitioner Becker's intention to pursue an appeal once he filed his timely, though unsigned, notice of appeal in the district court. We never objected to the lack of a signature on his notice of appeal, and fully expected the court of appeals to address his appellate arguments on the merits.\" Id., at 5.~    ~    ~      11~      We granted certiorari, 531 U.S. 1069; 531 U.S. 1110 (2001), to assure the uniform interpretation of the governing Federal Rules, and now address the question whether Becker's failure to sign his timely filed notice of appeal requires the Court of Appeals to dismiss his appeal.1~    ~    II~    ~      12~      In Mattingly v. Farmers State Bank, 153 F.3d 336 (1998) (per curiam), the Sixth Circuit determined that a notice of appeal must be signed, and that a signature's omission cannot be cured by giving the appellant an opportunity to sign after the time to appeal has expired. For this determination, that court relied on the complementary operation of two Federal Rules: Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure (Appellate Rule) 4(a)(1), which provides that \"the notice of appeal required by Rule 3 [to commence an appeal] must be filed with the district clerk within 30 days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered\";2 and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (Civil Rule) 11(a), which provides that \"[e]very . . . paper [filed in a district court] shall be signed.\" We agree with the Sixth Circuit that the governing Federal Rules call for a signature on notices of appeal. We disagree, however, with that court's dispositive ruling that the signature requirement cannot be met after the appeal period expires.~    ~    ~      13~      Civil Rule 11(a), the source of the signature requirement, comes into play on appeal this way. An appeal can be initiated, Appellate Rule 3(a)(1) instructs, \"only by filing a notice of appeal with the district clerk within the time allowed by [Appellate] Rule 4.\" Whenever the Appellate Rules provide for a filing in the district court, Appellate Rule 1(a)(2) directs, \"the procedure must comply with the practice of the district court.\" The district court practice relevant here is Civil Rule 11(a).~    ~    ~      14~      Rule 11(a)'s first sentence states the signature requirement:~    ~    ~      15~      \"Every pleading, written motion, and other paper shall be signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney's individual name, or, if the party is not represented by an attorney, shall be signed by the party.\"~    ~    ~      16~      Notices of appeal unquestionably qualify as \"other paper[s],\" so they \"shall be signed.\"~    ~    ~      17~      Becker maintains that typing one's name satisfies the signature requirement and that his original notice of appeal, containing his name typed above \"(Counsel of Record),\" met Civil Rule 11(a)'s instruction. We do not doubt that the signature requirement can be adjusted to keep pace with technological advances. A 1996 amendment to Civil Rule 5 provides in this regard: \"A court may by local rule permit papers to be filed, signed, or verified by electronic means that are consistent with technical standards, if any, that the Judicial Conference of the United States establishes. A paper filed by electronic means in compliance with a local rule constitutes a written paper for the purpose of applying these rules.\" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 5(e). See, e.g., Rule 5.1 (ND Ohio 2000) (permitting \"papers filed, signed, or verified by electronic means\"). The local rules on electronic filing provide some assurance, as does a handwritten signature, that the submission is authentic. See, e.g., United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Electronic Filing Policies and Procedures Manual 4 (April 2, 2001) (available at http://www.ohnd.uscourts.gov/Electronic_Filing/user.pdf) (allowing only registered attorneys assigned identification names and passwords to file papers electronically). Without any rule change so ordering, however, we are not disposed to extend the meaning of the word \"signed,\" as that word appears in Civil Rule 11(a), to permit typed names. As Rule 11(a) is now framed, we read the requirement of a signature to indicate, as a signature requirement commonly does, and as it did in John Hancock's day, a name handwritten (or a mark handplaced).~    ~    ~      18~      As plainly as Civil Rule 11(a) requires a signature on filed papers, however, so the rule goes on to provide in its final sentence that \"omission of the signature\" may be \"corrected promptly after being called to the attention of the attorney or party.\" \"Correction can be made,\" the Rules Advisory Committee noted, \"by signing the paper on file or by submitting a duplicate that contains the signature.\" Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 11, 28 U.S.C. App., p. 666.~    ~    ~      19~      Amicus urges that only the first sentence of Civil Rule 11(a), containing the signature requirement-not Rule 11(a)'s final sentence, providing for correction of a signature omission-applies to appeal notices. Appellate Rule 1(a)(2)'s direction to \"comply with the practice of the district court\" ceases to hold sway, amicus maintains, once the notice of appeal is transmitted from the district court, in which it is filed, to the court of appeals, in which the case will proceed. Brief of Amicus Curiae in Support of the Judgment Below 15-18, and nn. 18-20.~    ~    ~      20~      Civil Rule 11(a), in our view, cannot be sliced as amicus proposes. The rule was formulated and should be applied as a cohesive whole. So understood, the signature requirement and the cure for an initial failure to meet the requirement go hand in hand. The remedy for a signature omission, in other words, is part and parcel of the requirement itself. Becker proffered a correction of the defect in his notice in the manner Rule 11(a) permits-he attempted to submit a duplicate containing his signature, see supra, at 3-and therefore should not have suffered dismissal of his appeal for nonobservance of that rule.~    ~    ~      21~      The Sixth Circuit in Mattingly correctly observed that we have described Appellate Rules 3 and 4 as \"jurisdictional in nature.\" 153 F.3d, at 337 (citing Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487 U.S. 312, 315 (1988), and Smith v. Barry, 502 U.S. 244, 248 (1992)). We do not today hold otherwise. We rule simply and only that Becker's lapse was curable as Civil Rule 11(a) prescribes; his initial omission was not a \"jurisdictional\" impediment to pursuit of his appeal.~    ~    ~      22~      Appellate Rules 3 and 4, we clarify, are indeed linked jurisdictional provisions. Rule 3(a)(1) directs that a notice of appeal be filed \"within the time allowed by Rule 4,\" i.e., ordinarily, within 30 days after the judgment appealed from is entered, see supra, at 4, and n. 2. Rule 3(c)(1) details what the notice of appeal must contain: The notice, within Rule 4's timeframe, must (1) specify the party or parties taking the appeal; (2) designate the judgment from which the appeal is taken; and (3) name the court to which the appeal is taken.3 Notably, a signature requirement is not among Rule 3(c)(1)'s specifications, for Civil Rule 11(a) alone calls for and controls that requirement and renders it nonjurisdictional.~    ~    ~      23~      Amicus ultimately urges that even if there is no jurisdictional notice of appeal signature requirement for parties represented by attorneys, pro se parties, like Becker, must sign within Rule 4's time line to avoid automatic dismissal. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 34-36. Appellate Rule 3(c)(2) is the foundation for this argument. That provision reads: \"A pro se notice of appeal is considered filed on behalf of the signer and the signer's spouse and minor children (if they are parties), unless the notice clearly indicates otherwise.\"~    ~    ~      24~      We do not agree that Rule 3(c)(2)'s prescription, added in 1993 to a then unsubdivided Rule 3(c), see Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule App. Proc. 3, 28 U.S.C. App., p. 590, places pro se litigants in a singularly exacting time bind. The provision, as we read it, does not dislodge the signature requirement from its Civil Rule 11(a) moorings and make of it an Appellate Rule 3 jurisdictional specification. The current Rule 3(c)(2), like other changes made in 1993, the Advisory Committee Notes explain, was designed \"to prevent the loss of a right to appeal through inadvertent omission of a party's name\" when \"it is objectively clear that [the] party intended to appeal.\" Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule App. Proc. 3, 28 U.S.C. App., p. 590. Seen in this light, the Rule is entirely ameliorative; it assumes and assures that the pro se litigant's spouse and minor children, if they were parties below, will remain parties on appeal, \"unless the notice clearly indicates a contrary intent.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      25~      If we had any doubt that Appellate Rule 3(c)(2) was meant only to facilitate, not to impede, access to an appeal, we would find corroboration in a related ameliorative rule, Appellate Rule 3(c)(4), which provides: \"An appeal must not be dismissed for informality of form or title of the notice of appeal, or for failure to name a party whose intent to appeal is otherwise clear from the notice.\" Cf. this Court's Rule 14.5 (\"If the Clerk determines that a petition submitted timely and in good faith is in a form that does not comply with this Rule [governing the content of petitions for certiorari] or with Rule 33 or Rule 34 [governing document preparation], the Clerk will return it with a letter indicating the deficiency. A corrected petition received no more than 60 days after the date of the Clerk's letter will be deemed timely.\").~    ~    ~      26~      In Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487 U.S. 312 (1988), it is true, we held, that a notice of appeal that omitted the name of a particular appellant, through a clerical error, was ineffective to take an appeal for that party. Id., at 318 (construing Rule 3(c) prior to the ameliorative changes made in 1993).4 Becker's notice, however, did not suffer from any failure to \"specify the party or parties taking the appeal.\" Fed. Rule App. Proc. 3(c)(1)(A). Other opinions of this Court are in full harmony with the view that imperfections in noticing an appeal should not be fatal where no genuine doubt exists about who is appealing, from what judgment, to which appellate court. See Smith v. Barry, 502 U.S. 244, 245, 248-249 (1992) (holding that \"a document intended to serve as an appellate brief [filed within the time specified by Appellate Rule 4 and containing the information required by Appellate Rule 3] may qualify as the notice of appeal\"); Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 181 (1962) (holding that an appeal was improperly dismissed when the record as a whole-including a timely but incomplete notice of appeal and a premature but complete notice-revealed the orders petitioner sought to appeal).~    ~    ~      27~      * * *~    ~    ~      28~      In sum, the Federal Rules require a notice of appeal to be signed. That requirement derives from Civil Rule 11(a), and so does the remedy for a signature's omission on the notice originally filed. On the facts here presented, the Sixth Circuit should have accepted Becker's corrected notice as perfecting his appeal. We therefore reverse the judgment dismissing Becker's appeal and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      29~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         Without any party to defend the Sixth Circuit's position, we invited Stewart A. Baker to brief and argue this case, as amicus curiae, in support of the judgment below. 531 U.S. 1110 (2001). His able representation, and that of Jeffrey S. Sutton, whom we appointed to represent Becker, 531 U.S. __ (2001), permit us to decide this case satisfied that the relevant issues have been fully aired.~      ~      ~        2~         On motion filed no later than 30 days after expiration of the original appeal time, the appeal period may be extended upon a showing of \"excusable neglect or good cause,\" but the extension \"may [not] exceed 30 days after the [originally] prescribed time or 10 days after the date when the order granting the motion is entered, whichever is later.\" Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(5).~      ~      ~        3~         Appellate Rule 3(c)(1), as currently framed, provides in full:   \"(1) The notice of appeal must:   \"(A) specify the party or parties taking the appeal by naming each one in the caption or body of the notice, but an attorney representing more than one party may describe those parties with such terms as 'all plaintiffs,' 'the defendants,' 'the plaintiffs A, B, et al.,' or 'all defendants except X';   \"(B) designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed; and   \"(C) name the court to which the appeal is taken.\"~      ~      ~        4~         The Advisory Committee intended the elaborate 1993 amendment of Appellate Rule 3(c) \"to reduce the amount of satellite litigation spawned by [Torres].\" Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed.

THOMAS~    No. 00-391.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued April 25, 2001Decided June 4, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      While officers were investigating marijuana sales and making arrests at a Florida home, respondent Thomas drove up, parked in the home's driveway, and walked toward the back of his car. An officer met him there and asked his name and whether he had a driver's license. After a check of Thomas' license revealed an outstanding warrant, the officer arrested him, handcuffed him, and took him inside the home. The officer then went back outside, alone, and searched Thomas' car, finding several bags containing methamphetamine. Thomas was charged with possession of that drug and related offenses. The trial court granted his motion to suppress the evidence of narcotics and narcotic paraphernalia. The Second District Court of Appeal reversed, finding the search valid under New York v. Belton, 453 U.S. 454, in which this Court established a \"bright-line\" rule permitting an officer who has made a lawful custodial arrest of a car's occupant to search the car's passenger compartment as a contemporaneous incident of the arrest. Holding that Belton did not apply, the Florida Supreme Court reversed, but remanded for the trial court to determine whether the vehicle search was justified under Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752. This Court granted certiorari to consider whether, as the State Supreme Court had held, Belton's bright-line rule is limited to situations where the officer initiates contact with a vehicle's occupant while that person remains in the vehicle.~      Held: The Court lacks jurisdiction to decide the question on which certiorari was granted. Although the parties did not raise the issue in their briefs on the merits, this Court must first consider whether it has jurisdiction to decide this case. See Duquesne Light Co. v. Barasch, 488 U.S. 299, 306. Title 28 U.S.C.  1257(a) authorizes this Court to review \"[f]inal judgments ... by the highest court of a State ... where any ... right ... is specially set up or claimed under the Constitution.\" In a criminal prosecution, finality generally is defined by a judgment of conviction and the imposition of a sentence. Fort Wayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana, 489 U.S. 46, 54. However, in certain circumstances, the Court has treated state-court judgments as final for jurisdictional purposes even though further proceedings were to take place in the state court. Flynt v. Ohio, 451 U.S. 619, 620-621. In Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U.S. 469, 479-483, the Court divided cases of this kind into four categories: (1) cases in which there are further proceedings, even entire trials, yet to occur in the state courts, but where the federal issue is conclusive or the outcome of further proceedings preordained; (2) cases in which the federal issue, finally decided by a State's highest court, will survive and require decision regardless of the outcome of future state-court proceedings; (3) cases in which the federal claim has been finally decided, with further proceedings on the merits in the state courts to come, but in which later review of the federal issue cannot be had, whatever the ultimate outcome of the case; and (4) cases in which the state courts have finally decided the federal issue with further proceedings pending in which the party seeking review in this Court might prevail on the merits on nonfederal grounds, thus rendering unnecessary review of the federal issue by this Court, and where reversal of the state court on the federal issue would be preclusive of any further litigation on the relevant cause of action rather than merely controlling the nature and character of, or determining the admissibility of evidence in, the state proceedings still to come. Because none of those categories fits the Florida Supreme Court's judgment in this case, the judgment is not final. Pp. 2-6.~      Certiorari dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Reported below: 761 So. 2d 1010.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF FLORIDA~      Rehnquist, C. J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.~      Opinion of the Court~      Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      In New York v. Belton, 453 U.S. 454 (1981), we established a \"bright-line\" rule permitting a law enforcement officer who has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of a car to search the passenger compartment of that car as a contemporaneous incident of the arrest. We granted certiorari to consider whether that rule is limited to situations in which the officer initiates contact with the occupant of a vehicle while that person remains inside the vehicle. 531 U.S. 1069 (2000). We find, however, that we lack jurisdiction to decide the question.~    ~    ~      2~      On the evening at issue, officers were present at a home in Polk County, Florida, investigating the sale of marijuana and making arrests. Respondent Robert Thomas drove up to the residence, parked in the driveway, and walked toward the back of his vehicle. Officer J. D. Maney met Thomas at the rear of Thomas' vehicle, and asked him his name and whether he had a driver's license. After a check of Thomas' license revealed an outstanding warrant for his arrest, Officer Maney arrested him, handcuffed him, and took him inside the residence. The officer then went back outside, alone, and searched Thomas' car. The search revealed several small bags containing a white substance that tested positive for methamphetamine.~    ~    ~      3~      Respondent was charged with possession of methamphetamine and related narcotics offenses. The trial court granted his motion to suppress the evidence of narcotics and narcotic paraphernalia. The Second District Court of Appeal reversed, 711 So. 2d 1241 (1998), finding the search valid under New York v. Belton, supra. The Supreme Court of Florida in turn reversed, holding that Belton did not apply.~    ~    ~      4~      The court held that \"Belton's bright-line rule is limited to situations where the law enforcement officer initiates contact with the defendant\" while the defendant remains in the car. 761 So. 2d 1010, 1014 (2000). The court concluded that Belton was inapplicable, and directed that the trial court determine \"whether the factors in Chimel [v. California, 395 U.S. 752 (1969),] justify the search of Thomas' vehicle.\" 761 So. 2d, at 1014. The court explained that \"[b]ased on the record ... we are unable to ascertain whether [the officer's] safety was endangered or whether the preservation of the evidence was in jeopardy,\" as necessary to justify the search under Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752 (1969), and remanded for further proceedings.~    ~    ~      5~      Although the parties did not raise the issue in their briefs on the merits, we must first consider whether we have jurisdiction to decide this case. See Duquesne Light Co. v. Barasch, 488 U.S. 299, 306 (1989). Title 28 U.S.C.  1257(a) authorizes this Court to review \"[f]inal judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had ... where any title, right, privilege, or immunity is specially set up or claimed under the Constitution.\" In a criminal prosecution, finality generally \"is defined by a judgment of conviction and the imposition of a sentence.\" Fort Wayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana, 489 U.S. 46, 54 (1989). But we have not, in practice, interpreted the finality rule so strictly. In certain circumstances, we have \"treated state-court judgments as final for jurisdictional purposes although there were further proceedings to take place in the state court.\" Flynt v. Ohio, 451 U.S. 619, 620-621 (1981) (per curiam). In Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U.S. 469 (1975), we divided cases of this kind into four categories. None fits the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court, however, and we therefore conclude that its judgment is not final.~    ~    ~      6~      The first Cox category includes those cases in which \"there are further proceedings-even entire trials-yet to occur in the state courts but where for one reason or another the federal issue is conclusive or the outcome of further proceedings preordained.\" Id., at 479. The prototypical example of this category is Mills v. Alabama, 384 U.S. 214 (1966). There the Supreme Court of Alabama held that a statute which prohibited the publication of an editorial endorsement on election day did not violate the First Amendment, and remanded the case for trial. Id., at 216-217. Mills conceded that his only defense to the state charge was his constitutional claim; he admitted that he did publish the editorial. We held that this was a \"final judgment\" and took jurisdiction, saying that a trial \"would be no more than a few formal gestures leading inexorably towards a conviction, and then another appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court for it formally to repeat its rejection of Mills' constitutional contentions whereupon the case could then once more wind its weary way back to us as a judgment unquestionably final and appealable. Such a roundabout process would not only be an inexcusable delay of the benefits Congress intended to grant by providing for appeal to this Court, but it would also result in a completely unnecessary waste of time and energy in judicial systems already troubled by delays due to congested dockets.\" Id., at 217-218.~    ~    ~      7~      The decision of the Supreme Court of Florida here differs considerably from that of the state court in Mills. The Florida Supreme Court remanded the case not only for application of Chimel, but for further factfinding, and the State has not conceded that the search is invalid under Chimel.~    ~    ~      8~      In Cox's second category are those cases in which \"the federal issue, finally decided by the highest court in the State, will survive and require decision regardless of the outcome of future state-court proceedings.\" 420 U.S., at 480. In Cox we used our decision in Radio Station WOW, Inc. v. Johnson, 326 U.S. 120 (1945), to illustrate the second category. We said: \"In Radio Station WOW, the Nebraska Supreme Court directed the transfer of the properties of a federally licensed radio station and ordered an accounting, rejecting the claim that the transfer order would interfere with the federal license... . Nothing that could happen in the course of the accounting, short of settlement of the case, would foreclose or make unnecessary decision on the federal question.\" Cox, supra, at 480.~    ~    ~      9~      In this case, however, were the Florida courts to find that Chimel allows the search, a decision on the Belton issue would no longer be necessary. We have also noted that we treat state-court judgments in this category as final on the assumption that \" 'the federal questions that could come here have been adjudicated by the State court,' \" and the state proceedings to take place on remand \" 'could not remotely give rise to a federal question ... that may later come here.' \" Cox, 420 U.S., at 480. We cannot make that assumption in this case.~    ~    ~      10~      Cases where \"the federal claim has been finally decided, with further proceedings on the merits in the state courts to come, but in which later review of the federal issue cannot be had, whatever the ultimate outcome of the case,\" fall into Cox's third category. Id., at 481. New York v. Quarles, 467 U.S. 649 (1984), is such a case. Respondent was charged in state court with criminal possession of a weapon, and certain evidence was suppressed on federal constitutional grounds. We granted the petition for certiorari and reversed, explaining that the suppression ruling was a \"final judgment\" although respondent had yet to be tried. Id., at 651. We said that this case fell within Cox's third category because \"should the State convict respondent at trial, its claim that certain evidence was wrongfully suppressed will be moot. Should respondent be acquitted at trial, the State will be precluded from pressing its federal claim again on appeal.\" 467 U.S., at 651, and n. 1.~    ~    ~      11~      To deny review here would not necessarily cause Florida to go to trial without the suppressed evidence, with further appeal barred in the event of an acquittal or the federal claim mooted in the event of a conviction. The state court has yet to decide whether the evidence should be suppressed; that will be resolved on remand. If the State prevails on remand and the evidence is admitted under Chimel, then the Belton issue will be moot, and the State cannot seek review of it. But if the State loses, and the evidence is suppressed, Florida law allows the State to appeal, as long as it does so prior to trial. Fla. Stat. 924.071(1) (1996) (\"The state may appeal from a pretrial order ... suppressing evidence\"); Fla. Rule App. Proc. 9.140(c)(1)(B) (2001) (\"The state may appeal an order ... suppressing before trial ... evidence obtained by search and seizure\"). Should the Supreme Court of Florida rule against the State on the Chimel issue, the question of suppression would be finally decided by the Florida courts, and the State could then seek certiorari in this Court. At that time it could obtain review of both the Belton issue and the Chimel issue. See Jefferson v. City of Tarrant, 522 U.S. 75, 83 (1997).~    ~    ~      12~      The fourth Cox category includes those cases where \"the federal issue has been finally decided in the state courts with further proceedings pending in which the party seeking review here might prevail on the merits on nonfederal grounds, thus rendering unnecessary review of the federal issue by this Court, and where reversal of the state court on the federal issue would be preclusive of any further litigation on the relevant cause of action rather than merely controlling the nature and character of, or determining the admissibility of evidence in, the state proceedings still to come. In these circumstances, if a refusal immediately to review the state-court decision might seriously erode federal policy, the Court has entertained and decided the federal issue, which itself has been finally determined by the state courts for purposes of the state litigation.\" 420 U.S., at 482-483.~    ~    ~      13~      Here the State can make no claim of serious erosion of federal policy that is not common to all run-of-the-mine decisions suppressing evidence in criminal trials. The fourth Cox exception does not apply here.~    ~    ~      14~      For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss the writ of certiorari for want of jurisdiction.~    ~    ~      15~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ",

JOHNSON, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, INSTITUTIONAL DIVISION~    No. 00-6677.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued March 27, 2001Decided June 4, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      In 1989, this Court held that petitioner Penry had been sentenced to death in violation of the Eighth Amendment. At the close of the penalty hearing during Penry's first Texas capital murder trial, the jury was instructed to answer three statutorily mandated \"special issues\": (1) whether Penry's conduct was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that death would result; (2) whether it was probable that he would be a continuing threat to society; and (3) whether the killing was unreasonable in response to any provocation by the deceased. Although Penry had offered extensive evidence that he was mentally retarded and had been severely abused as a child, the jury was never told it could consider and give mitigating effect to that evidence in imposing sentence. In holding that the jury had not been adequately instructed with respect to the mitigating evidence, the Court found, among other things, that none of the special issues was broad enough to allow the jury to consider and give effect to that evidence. Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302 (1989) (Penry I). When Texas retried Penry in 1990, he was again found guilty of capital murder. During the penalty phase, the defense again put on extensive evidence regarding Penry's mental impairments and childhood abuse. On direct examination by the defense, a clinical neuropsychologist, Dr. Price, testified that he believed Penry suffered from organic brain impairment and mental retardation. During cross-examination, Price cited as one of the records he had reviewed in preparing his testimony a psychiatric evaluation prepared by Dr. Peebles in 1977 at the request of Penry's then-counsel to determine Penry's competency to stand trial on an earlier charge unrelated to the murder at issue. Over a defense objection, Price recited a portion of that evaluation which stated that it was Peebles' professional opinion that if Penry were released, he would be dangerous to others. When it came time to submit the case to the jury, the trial court instructed the jury to determine Penry's sentence by answering the same three special issues that were at issue in Penry I. The trial court then gave a \"supplemental instruction\": \"[W]hen you deliberate on the ... special issues, you are to consider mitigating circumstances, if any, supported by the evidence ... . If you find [such] circumstances ... , you must decide how much weight they deserve, if any, and therefore, give effect and consideration to them in assessing the defendant's personal culpability at the time you answer the special issue. If you determine, when giving effect to the mitigating evidence, if any, that a life sentence, as reflected by a negative finding to the issue under consideration, rather than a death sentence, is an appropriate response to [Penry's] personal culpability ... , a negative finding should be given to one of the special issues.\" The verdict form itself, however, contained only the text of the three special issues, and gave the jury two choices with respect to each: \"Yes\" or \"No.\" Because the jury unanimously answered \"yes\" to each special issue, the court sentenced Penry to death in accordance with state law. In affirming, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejected Penry's claims that the admission of language from the Peebles report violated Penry's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, and that the jury instructions were constitutionally inadequate because they did not permit the jury to consider and give effect to his particular mitigating evidence. With respect to the latter, the court held that the supplemental instruction met Penry I's constitutional requirements. After his petition for state habeas corpus relief was denied, Penry petitioned for federal habeas relief under 28 U.S.C.  2254. The District Court found that the state appellate court's conclusions on both of Penry's claims were neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. The Fifth Circuit denied a certificate of appealability.~      Held:   1. Penry's argument is unavailing that the admission into evidence of the portion of the Peebles report referring to his future dangerousness violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. This case is distinguishable from Estelle v. Smith, 451 U.S. 454, in which the Court held that the admission of a psychiatrist's testimony on the topic of future dangerousness, based on a defendant's uncounseled statements, violated the Fifth Amendment. The Court need not and does not decide whether the several respects in which this case differs from Estelle affect the merits of Penry's claim. Rather, the question is whether the Texas court's decision was \"contrary to\" or an \"unreasonable application\" of this Court's precedent. 28 U.S.C.  2254(d)(1); see Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362. It was not. The differences between this case and Estelle are substantial, and the Court's Estelle opinion suggested that its holding was limited to the \"distinct circumstances\" presented there. 451 U.S., at 466. It also indicated that the Fifth Amendment analysis might be different where a defendant introduces psychiatric evidence at the penalty phase. Id., at 472. Indeed, the Court has never extended Estelle's Fifth Amendment holding beyond its particular facts. Cf., e.g., Buchanan v. Kentucky, 483 U.S. 402. It therefore cannot be said that it was objectively unreasonable for the Texas court to conclude that Penry is not entitled to relief on his Fifth Amendment claim. See Williams, supra, at 409. Even if the Court's precedent were to establish squarely that use of the Peebles report violated the Fifth Amendment, that error would justify overturning Penry's sentence only if he could establish that the error had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict. E.g., Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 637. There is considerable doubt that Penry could make such a showing. The excerpt from the Peebles report was neither the first nor the last expert opinion the jury heard to the effect that Penry posed a future danger and was by no means the key to the State's case on future dangerousness. Pp. 9-12.~      2. The jury instructions at Penry's resentencing, however, did not comply with the Court's mandate in Penry I. To the extent the Texas appellate court believed that Penry I was satisfied merely because a supplemental instruction was given, the court clearly misapprehended that prior decision. The key under Penry I is that the jury be able to \"consider and give effect to [a defendant's mitigating] evidence in imposing sentence.\" 492 U.S., at 319. To the extent the state court concluded that the substance of the jury instructions given at Penry's resentencing satisfied Penry I, that determination was objectively unreasonable. The three special issues submitted to the jury were identical to the ones found inadequate in Penry I. Although the supplemental instruction mentioned mitigating evidence, the mechanism it purported to create for the jurors to give effect to that evidence was ineffective and illogical. The jury was clearly instructed that a \"yes\" answer to a special issue was appropriate only when supported by the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, and that a \"no\" answer was appropriate only when there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the answer to a special issue should be \"yes. \" The verdict form listed the three special issues and, with no mention of mitigating circumstances, confirmed and clarified the jury's two choices with respect to each special issue. In the State's view, however, the jury was also told that it could ignore these clear guidelines and-even if there was in fact no reasonable doubt as to the matter inquired about-answer any special issue in the negative if the mitigating circumstances warranted a life sentence. In other words, the jury could change one or more truthful \"yes\" answers to an untruthful \"no\" answer in order to avoid a death sentence for Penry. The supplemental instruction thereby made the jury charge as a whole internally contradictory, and placed law-abiding jurors in an impossible situation. The comments of the prosecutor and defense counsel, as well as the comments of the court during voir dire, did little to clarify the confusion caused by the instructions themselves. Any realistic assessment of the manner in which the supplemental instruction operated would therefore lead to the same conclusion the Court reached in Penry I: \"[A] reasonable juror could well have believed that there was no vehicle for expressing the view that Penry did not deserve to be sentenced to death based upon his mitigating evidence.\" 492 U.S., at 326. Pp. 12-20.~      215 F.3d 504, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT~      O'Connor, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, Parts I, II, and III-A of which were unanimous, and Part III-B of which was joined by Stevens, Kennedy, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ.~      Thomas, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and Scalia, J., joined.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      In 1989, we held that Johnny Paul Penry had been sentenced to death in violation of the Eighth Amendment because his jury had not been adequately instructed with respect to mitigating evidence. See Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302 (1989) (Penry I). The State of Texas retried Penry in 1990, and that jury also found him guilty of capital murder and sentenced him to death. We now consider whether the jury instructions at Penry's resentencing complied with our mandate in Penry I. We also consider whether the admission into evidence of statements from a psychiatric report based on an uncounseled interview with Penry ran afoul of the Fifth Amendment.~    ~    ~      2~      * Johnny Paul Penry brutally raped and murdered Pamela Carpenter on October 25, 1979. In 1980, a Texas jury found him guilty of capital murder. At the close of the penalty hearing, the jury was instructed to answer three statutorily mandated \"special issues\":~    ~    ~      3~      \" '(1) whether the conduct of the defendant that caused the death of the deceased was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that the death of the deceased or another would result;~    ~    ~      4~      \" '(2) whether there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society; and~    ~    ~      5~      \" '(3) if raised by the evidence, whether the conduct of the defendant in killing the deceased was unreasonable in response to the provocation, if any, by the deceased.' \" Id., at 310 (quoting Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.071(b) (Vernon 1981 and Supp. 1989)).~    ~    ~      6~      The jury answered \"yes\" to each issue and, as required by statute, the trial court sentenced Penry to death. 492 U.S., at 310-311.~    ~    ~      7~      Although Penry had offered extensive evidence that he was mentally retarded and had been severely abused as a child, the jury was never instructed that it could consider and give mitigating effect to that evidence in imposing sentence. Id., at 320. Nor was any of the three special issues broad enough in scope that the jury could consider and give effect to the mitigating evidence in answering the special issue. Id., at 322-325. While Penry's mental retardation was potentially relevant to the first special issue-whether he had acted deliberately-we found no way to be sure that the jurors fully considered the mitigating evidence as it bore on the broader question of Penry's moral culpability. Id., at 322-323. As to the second issue-whether Penry would be a future danger-the evidence of his mental retardation and history of abuse was \"relevant only as an aggravating factor.\" Id., at 323 (emphasis in original). And the evidence was simply not relevant in a mitigating way to the third issue- whether Penry had unreasonably responded to any provocation. Id., at 324-325.~    ~    ~      8~      The comments of counsel also failed to clarify the jury's role. Defense counsel had urged the jurors to vote \"no\" on one of the special issues if they believed that Penry, because of the mitigating evidence, did not deserve to be put to death. The prosecutor, however, had reminded them of their \"oath to follow the law and ... answe[r] these questions based on the evidence and following the law.\" Id., at 325 (internal quotation marks omitted).~    ~    ~      9~      \"In light of the prosecutor's argument, and ... in the absence of instructions informing the jury that it could consider and give effect to the mitigating evidence of Penry's mental retardation and abused background by declining to impose the death penalty,\" we concluded that \"a reasonable juror could well have believed that there was no vehicle for expressing the view that Penry did not deserve to be sentenced to death based upon his mitigating evidence.\" Id., at 326, 328. We thus vacated Penry's sentence, confirming that in a capital case, \"[t]he sentencer must ... be able to consider and give effect to [mitigating] evidence in imposing sentence,\" so that \" 'the sentence imposed ... reflec[ts] a reasoned moral response to the defendant's background, character, and crime.' \" Id., at 319 (quoting California v. Brown, 479 U.S. 538, 545 (1987) (O'Connor, J., concurring) (emphasis in original)).~    ~    ~      10~      Penry was retried in 1990 and again found guilty of capital murder. During the penalty phase, the defense again put on extensive evidence regarding Penry's mental impairments and childhood abuse. One defense witness on the subject of Penry's mental impairments was Dr. Randall Price, a clinical neuropsychologist. On direct examination, Dr. Price testified that he believed Penry suffered from organic brain impairment and mental retardation. App. 276-279; 878. In the course of cross-examining Dr. Price, the prosecutor asked what records Price had reviewed in preparing his testimony. Price cited 14 reports, including a psychiatric evaluation of Penry prepared by Dr. Felix Peebles on May 19, 1977. Id., at 327. The Peebles report had been prepared at the request of Penry's then-counsel to determine Penry's competency to stand trial on a 1977 rape charge-unrelated to the rape and murder of Pamela Carpenter. Id., at 55-60, 125. The prosecutor asked Dr. Price to read a specific portion of the Peebles report for the jury. Over the objection of defense counsel, Dr. Price recited that it was Dr. Peebles' \"professional opinion that if Johnny Paul Penry were released from custody, that he would be dangerous to other persons.\" Id., at 413. The prosecutor again recited this portion of the Peebles report during his closing argument. Id., at 668.~    ~    ~      11~      When it came time to submit the case to the jury, the court instructed the jury to determine Penry's sentence by answering three special issues-the same three issues that had been put before the jury in Penry I. Specifically, the jury had to determine whether Penry acted deliberately when he killed Pamela Carpenter; whether there was a probability that Penry would be dangerous in the future; and whether Penry acted unreasonably in response to provocation. App. 676-678. Cf. Penry I, 492 U.S., at 320.~    ~    ~      12~      The court told the jury how to determine its answers to those issues: \"[B]efore any issue may be answered 'Yes,' all jurors must be convinced by the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the answer to such issue should be 'Yes.' ... [I]f any juror, after considering the evidence and these instructions, has a reasonable doubt as to whether the answer to a Special Issue should be answered 'Yes,' then such juror should vote 'No' to that Special Issue.\" App. 672-673.~    ~    ~      13~      The court explained the consequences of the jury's decision:~    ~    ~      14~      \"[I]f you return an affirmative finding on each of the special issues submitted to you, the court shall sentence the defendant to death. You are further instructed that if you return a negative finding on any special issue submitted to you, the court shall sentence the defendant to the Texas Department of Corrections for life. You are therefore instructed that your answers to the special issues, which determine the punishment to be assessed the defendant by the court, should be reflective of your finding as to the personal culpability of the defendant, JOHNNY PAUL PENRY, in this case.\" Id., at 674-675. The court then gave the following \"supplemental instruction\":~    ~    ~      15~      \"You are instructed that when you deliberate on the questions posed in the special issues, you are to consider mitigating circumstances, if any, supported by the evidence presented in both phases of the trial, whether presented by the state or the defendant. A mitigating circumstance may include, but is not limited to, any aspect of the defendant's character and record or circumstances of the crime which you believe could make a death sentence inappropriate in this case. If you find that there are any mitigating circumstances in this case, you must decide how much weight they deserve, if any, and therefore, give effect and consideration to them in assessing the defendant's personal culpability at the time you answer the special issue. If you determine, when giving effect to the mitigating evidence, if any, that a life sentence, as reflected by a negative finding to the issue under consideration, rather than a death sentence, is an appropriate response to the personal culpability of the defendant, a negative finding should be given to one of the special issues.\" Id., at 675.~    ~    ~      16~      A complete copy of the instructions was attached to the verdict form, and the jury took the entire packet into the deliberation room. Tr. of Oral Arg. 31. The verdict form itself, however, contained only the text of the three special issues, and gave the jury two choices with respect to each special issue: \"We, the jury, unanimously find and determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the answer to this Special Issue is 'Yes,' \" or \"We, the jury, because at least ten (10) jurors have a reasonable doubt as to the matter inquired about in this Special Issue, find and determine that the answer to this Special Issue is 'No.' \" App. 676-678.~    ~    ~      17~      After deliberating for approximately 21/2 hours, the jury returned its punishment verdict. See 51 Record 1948, 1950. The signed verdict form confirmed that the jury had unanimously agreed that the answer to each special issue was \"yes.\" App. 676-678. In accordance with state law, the court sentenced Penry to death.~    ~    ~      18~      The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed Penry's conviction and sentence. The court rejected Penry's claim that the admission of language from the 1977 Peebles report violated Penry's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The court reasoned that because Dr. Peebles had examined Penry two years prior to the murder of Pamela Carpenter, Penry had not at that time been \"confronted with someone who was essentially an agent for the State whose function was to gather evidence that might be used against him in connection with the crime for which he was incarcerated.\" Penry v. State, 903 S. W. 2d 715, 759-760 (1995) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).~    ~    ~      19~      The court also rejected Penry's claim that the jury instructions given at his second sentencing hearing were constitutionally inadequate because they did not permit the jury to consider and give effect to his mitigating evidence of mental retardation and childhood abuse. The court cited Penry I for the proposition that when a defendant proffers \"mitigating evidence that is not relevant to the special issues or that has relevance to the defendant's moral culpability beyond the scope of the special issues ... the jury must be given a special instruction in order to allow it to consider and give effect to such evidence.\" 903 S. W. 2d, at 765. Quoting the supplemental jury instruction given at Penry's second trial, see supra, at 5-6, the court overruled Penry's claim of error. The court stated that \"a nullification instruction such as this one is sufficient to meet the constitutional requirements of [Penry I].\" 903 S. W. 2d, at 765.~    ~    ~      20~      In 1998, after his petition for state habeas corpus relief was denied, see App. 841 (trial court order); id., at 863 (Court of Criminal Appeals order), Penry filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  2254 (1994 ed. and Supp. V) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The District Court rejected both of Penry's claims, finding that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals' conclusions on both points were neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. App. 893, 920. After full briefing and argument, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied a certificate of appealability. 215 F.3d 504 (2000).~    ~    ~      21~      We stayed Penry's execution and granted certiorari to consider Penry's constitutional arguments regarding the admission of the Peebles report and the adequacy of the jury instructions. 531 U.S. 1010 (2000).~    ~    II~    ~      22~      Because Penry filed his federal habeas petition after the enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, the provisions of that law govern the scope of our review. Specifically, 28 U.S.C.  2254(d)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. V) prohibits a federal court from granting an application for a writ of habeas corpus with respect to a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court unless that adjudication \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\"~    ~    ~      23~      Last Term in Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362 (2000), we explained that the \"contrary to\" and \"unreasonable application\" clauses of 2254(d)(1) have independent meaning. Id., at 404. A state court decision will be \"contrary to\" our clearly established precedent if the state court either \"applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in our cases,\" or \"confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of this Court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from our precedent.\" Id., at 405-406. A state court decision will be an \"unreasonable application of\" our clearly established precedent if it \"correctly identifies the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner's case.\" Id., at 407-408.~    ~    ~      24~      \"[A] federal habeas court making the 'unreasonable application' inquiry should ask whether the state court's application of clearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable.\" Id., at 409. Distinguishing between an unreasonable and an incorrect application of federal law, we clarified that even if the federal habeas court concludes that the state court decision applied clearly established federal law incorrectly, relief is appropriate only if that application is also objectively unreasonable. Id., at 410-411.~    ~    ~      25~      Although the District Court evaluated the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals' disposition of Penry's claims under a standard we later rejected in Williams, see App. 882 (stating that an application of law to facts is \"unreasonable 'only when it can be said that reasonable jurists considering the question would be of one view that the state court ruling was incorrect' \" (citation omitted)), the Fifth Circuit articulated the proper standard of review, as set forth in 2254(d)(1) and clarified in Williams, and denied Penry relief. Guided by this same standard, we now turn to the substance of Penry's claims.~    ~    III~    ~      26~      * Penry contends that the admission into evidence of the portion of the 1977 Peebles report that referred to Penry's future dangerousness violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination because he was never warned that the statements he made to Dr. Peebles might later be used against him. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals disagreed, concluding that when Dr. Peebles interviewed Penry, Peebles was not acting as an agent for the State in order to gather evidence that might be used against Penry. 903 S. W. 2d, at 759.~    ~    ~      27~      Penry argues that this case is indistinguishable from Estelle v. Smith, 451 U.S. 454 (1981). In Estelle, we considered a situation in which a psychiatrist conducted an ostensibly neutral competency examination of a capital defendant, but drew conclusions from the defendant's uncounseled statements regarding his future dangerousness, and later testified for the prosecution on that crucial issue. We likened the psychiatrist to \"an agent of the State recounting unwarned statements made in a postarrest custodial setting,\" and held that \"[a] criminal defendant, who neither initiates a psychiatric evaluation nor attempts to introduce any psychiatric evidence, may not be compelled to respond to a psychiatrist if his statements can be used against him at a capital sentencing proceeding.\" Id., at 467-468. The admission of the psychiatrist's testimony under those \"distinct circumstances\" violated the Fifth Amendment. Id., at 466.~    ~    ~      28~      This case differs from Estelle in several respects. First, the defendant in Estelle had not placed his mental condition at issue, id., at 457, n. 1, whereas Penry himself made his mental status a central issue in both the 1977 rape case and his trials for Pamela Carpenter's rape and murder. Second, in Estelle, the trial court had called for the competency evaluation and the State had chosen the examining psychiatrist. Id., at 456-457. Here, however, it was Penry's own counsel in the 1977 case who requested the psychiatric exam performed by Dr. Peebles. Third, in Estelle, the State had called the psychiatrist to testify as a part of its affirmative case. Id., at 459. Here, it was during the cross-examination of Penry's own psychological witness that the prosecutor elicited the quotation from the Peebles report. And fourth, in Estelle, the defendant was charged with a capital crime at the time of his competency exam, and it was thus clear that his future dangerousness would be a specific issue at sentencing. Penry, however, had not yet murdered Pamela Carpenter at the time of his interview with Dr. Peebles.~    ~    ~      29~      We need not and do not decide whether these differences affect the merits of Penry's Fifth Amendment claim. Rather, the question is whether the Texas court's decision was contrary to or an unreasonable application of our precedent. 28 U.S.C.  2254(d)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. V). We think it was not. The differences between this case and Estelle are substantial, and our opinion in Estelle suggested that our holding was limited to the \"distinct circumstances\" presented there. It also indicated that the Fifth Amendment analysis might be different where a defendant \"intends to introduce psychiatric evidence at the penalty phase.\" 451 U.S., at 472. Indeed, we have never extended Estelle's Fifth Amendment holding beyond its particular facts. Cf., e.g., Buchanan v. Kentucky, 483 U.S. 402 (1987) (Estelle does not apply, and it does not violate the Fifth Amendment, where a prosecutor uses portions of a psychiatric evaluation requested by a defendant to rebut psychiatric evidence presented by the defendant at trial). We therefore cannot say that it was objectively unreasonable for the Texas court to conclude that Penry is not entitled to relief on his Fifth Amendment claim.~    ~    ~      30~      Even if our precedent were to establish squarely that the prosecution's use of the Peebles report violated Penry's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, that error would justify overturning Penry's sentence only if Penry could establish that the error \" 'had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.' \" Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 637 (1993) (quoting Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 776 (1946)). We think it unlikely that Penry could make such a showing.~    ~    ~      31~      The excerpt from the Peebles report bolstered the State's argument that Penry posed a future danger, but it was neither the first nor the last opinion the jury heard on that point. Four prison officials testified that they were of the opinion that Penry \"would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.\" App. 94, 104, 138; 47 Record 970. Three psychiatrists testified that Penry was a dangerous individual and likely to remain so. Two were the State's own witnesses. See App. 487, 557. The third was Dr. Price-the same defense witness whom the prosecutor had asked to read from the Peebles report. Before that recitation, Dr. Price had stated his own opinion that \"[i]f [Penry] was in the free world, I would consider him dangerous.\" Id., at 392.~    ~    ~      32~      While the Peebles report was an effective rhetorical tool, it was by no means the key to the State's case on the question whether Penry was likely to commit future acts of violence. We therefore have considerable doubt that the admission of the Peebles report, even if erroneous, had a \"substantial and injurious effect\" on the verdict. Brecht v. Abrahamson, supra, at 637. Accordingly, we will not disturb the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals' rejection of Penry's Fifth Amendment claim.~    ~    B~    ~      33~      Penry also contends that the jury instructions given at his second sentencing hearing did not comport with our holding in Penry I because they did not provide the jury with a vehicle for expressing its reasoned moral response to the mitigating evidence of Penry's mental retardation and childhood abuse. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals disagreed. The court summarized Penry I as holding that when a defendant proffers \"mitigating evidence that is not relevant to the special issues or that has relevance to the defendant's moral culpability beyond the scope of the special issues ... the jury must be given a special instruction in order to allow it to consider and give effect to such evidence.\" 903 S. W. 2d, at 765. The court then stated that the supplemental jury instruction given at Penry's second sentencing hearing satisfied that mandate. Ibid.~    ~    ~      34~      The Texas court did not make the rationale of its holding entirely clear. On one hand, it might have believed that Penry I was satisfied merely by virtue of the fact that a supplemental instruction had been given. On the other hand, it might have believed that it was the substance of that instruction which satisfied Penry I.~    ~    ~      35~      While the latter seems to be more likely, to the extent it was the former, the Texas court clearly misapprehended our prior decision. Penry I did not hold that the mere mention of \"mitigating circumstances\" to a capital sentencing jury satisfies the Eighth Amendment. Nor does it stand for the proposition that it is constitutionally sufficient to inform the jury that it may \"consider\" mitigating circumstances in deciding the appropriate sentence. Rather, the key under Penry I is that the jury be able to \"consider and give effect to [a defendant's mitigating] evidence in imposing sentence.\" 492 U.S., at 319 (emphasis added). See also Johnson v. Texas, 509 U.S. 350, 381 (1993) (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (\"[A] sentencer [must] be allowed to give full consideration and full effect to mitigating circumstances\" (emphasis in original)). For it is only when the jury is given a \"vehicle for expressing its 'reasoned moral response' to that evidence in rendering its sentencing decision,\" Penry I, 492 U.S., at 328, that we can be sure that the jury \"has treated the defendant as a 'uniquely individual human bein[g]' and has made a reliable determination that death is the appropriate sentence,\" id., at 319 (quoting Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 304, 305 (1976)).~    ~    ~      36~      The State contends that the substance of the supplemental instruction satisfied Penry I because it provided the jury with the requisite vehicle for expressing its reasoned moral response to Penry's particular mitigating evidence. Specifically, the State points to the admittedly \"less than artful\" portion of the supplemental instruction which says:~    ~    ~      37~      \"If you find that there are any mitigating circumstances in this case, you must decide how much weight they deserve, if any, and therefore, give effect and consideration to them in assessing the defendant's personal culpability at the time you answer the special issue. If you determine, when giving effect to the mitigating evidence, if any, that a life sentence, as reflected by a negative finding to the issue under consideration, rather than a death sentence, is an appropriate response to the personal culpability of the defendant, a negative finding should be given to one of the special issues.\" App. 675 (emphasis added). See also Brief for Respondent 16.~    ~    ~      38~      We see two possible ways to interpret this confusing instruction. First, as the portions italicized above indicate, it can be understood as telling the jurors to take Penry's mitigating evidence into account in determining their truthful answers to each special issue. Viewed in this light, however, the supplemental instruction placed the jury in no better position than was the jury in Penry I. As we made clear in Penry I, none of the special issues is broad enough to provide a vehicle for the jury to give mitigating effect to the evidence of Penry's mental retardation and childhood abuse. Cf. 492 U.S., at 322-325. In the words of Judge Dennis below, the jury's ability to consider and give effect to Penry's mitigating evidence was still \"shackled and confined within the scope of the three special issues.\" 215 F.3d, at 514 (dissenting opinion). Thus, because the supplemental instruction had no practical effect, the jury instructions at Penry's second sentencing were not meaningfully different from the ones we found constitutionally inadequate in Penry I.~    ~    ~      39~      Alternatively, the State urges, it is possible to understand the supplemental instruction as informing the jury that it could \"simply answer one of the special issues 'no' if it believed that mitigating circumstances made a life sentence ... appropriate ... regardless of its initial answers to the questions.\" Brief for Respondent 16. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals appeared to understand the instruction in this sense, when it termed the supplemental instruction a \"nullification instruction.\" 903 S. W. 2d, at 765. Even assuming the jurors could have understood the instruction to operate in this way, the instruction was not as simple to implement as the State contends. Rather, it made the jury charge as a whole internally contradictory, and placed law-abiding jurors in an impossible situation.~    ~    ~      40~      The jury was clearly instructed that a \"yes\" answer to a special issue was appropriate only when supported \"by the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.\" App. 672. A \"no\" answer was appropriate only when there was \"a reasonable doubt as to whether the answer to a Special Issue should be ... 'Yes.' \" Id., at 673. The verdict form listed the three special issues and, with no mention of mitigating circumstances, confirmed and clarified the jury's two choices with respect to each special issue. The jury could swear that it had unanimously determined \"beyond a reasonable doubt that the answer to this Special Issue is 'Yes.' \" Id., at 676-678. Or it could swear that at least 10 jurors had \"a reasonable doubt as to the matter inquired about in this Special Issue\" and that the jury thus had \"determin[ed] that the answer to this Special Issue is 'No.' \" Ibid. (emphasis added).~    ~    ~      41~      In the State's view, however, the jury was also told that it could ignore these clear guidelines and-even if there was in fact no reasonable doubt as to the matter inquired about-answer any special issue in the negative if the mitigating circumstances warranted a life sentence. In other words, the jury could change one or more truthful \"yes\" answers to an untruthful \"no\" answer in order to avoid a death sentence for Penry.~    ~    ~      42~      We generally presume that jurors follow their instructions. See, e.g., Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 211 (1987). Here, however, it would have been both logically and ethically impossible for a juror to follow both sets of instructions. Because Penry's mitigating evidence did not fit within the scope of the special issues, answering those issues in the manner prescribed on the verdict form necessarily meant ignoring the command of the supplemental instruction. And answering the special issues in the mode prescribed by the supplemental instruction necessarily meant ignoring the verdict form instructions. Indeed, jurors who wanted to answer one of the special issues falsely to give effect to the mitigating evidence would have had to violate their oath to render a \" 'true verdict.' \" Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann., Art. 35.22 (Vernon 1989).~    ~    ~      43~      The mechanism created by the supplemental instruction thus inserted \"an element of capriciousness\" into the sentencing decision, \"making the jurors' power to avoid the death penalty dependent on their willingness\" to elevate the supplemental instruction over the verdict form instructions. Roberts v. Louisiana, 428 U.S. 325, 335 (1976) (plurality opinion). There is, at the very least, \"a reasonable likelihood that the jury ... applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevent[ed] the consideration\" of Penry's mental retardation and childhood abuse. Boyde v. California, 494 U.S. 370, 380 (1990). The supplemental instruction therefore provided an inadequate vehicle for the jury to make a reasoned moral response to Penry's mitigating evidence.~    ~    ~      44~      Even though the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals focused solely on the supplemental instruction in affirming Penry's sentence, the State urges us to evaluate the instruction contextually, with reference to the comments of the prosecutor and defense counsel, as well as the comments of the court during voir dire. Indeed, we have said that we will approach jury instructions in the same way a jury would-with a \"commonsense understanding of the instructions in the light of all that has taken place at the trial.\" Id., at 381. Penry I itself illustrates this methodology, as there we evaluated the likely effect on the jury of the comments of the defense counsel and prosecutor. 492 U.S., at 325-326. As we did there, however, we conclude that these comments were insufficient to clarify the confusion caused by the instructions themselves.~    ~    ~      45~      Voir dire was a month-long process, during which approximately 90 prospective jurors were interviewed. See 3 Record (index of transcripts). Many of the veniremembers-including each of the 12 jurors who was eventually empaneled-received a copy of an instruction largely similar to the supplemental instruction ultimately given to the jury. After each juror read the instruction, the judge attempted to explain how it worked. See, e.g., 18 Record 966-967 (\"[I]f you thought the mitigating evidence was sufficient ... you might, even though you really felt those answers [to the three special issues] should be yes, you might answer one or more of them no ... so [Penry] could get the life sentence rather than the death penalty\"). The prosecutor then attempted to explain the instruction. See, e.g., id., at 980 (\"[E]ven though [you] believe all three of these answers are yes, [you] don't think the death penalty is appropriate for this particular person because of what has happened to him in the past ... . [The] instruction is to give effect to that belief and answer one or all of these issues no\"). And with most of the jurors, defense counsel also gave a similar explanation. See, e.g., id., at 1018 (\"[I]f you believe[d] [there] was a mitigating circumstance ... you [could] apply that mitigation to answer-going back and changing an answer from yes to a no\").~    ~    ~      46~      While these comments reinforce the State's construction of the supplemental instruction, they do not bolster our confidence in the jurors' ability to give effect to Penry's mitigating evidence in deciding his sentence. Rather, they highlight the arbitrary way in which the supplemental instruction operated, and the fact that the jury was essentially instructed to return a false answer to a special issue in order to avoid a death sentence.~    ~    ~      47~      Moreover, we are skeptical that, by the time their penalty phase deliberations began, the jurors would have remembered the explanations given during voir dire, much less taken them as a binding statement of the law. Voir dire began almost two full months before the penalty phase deliberations. In the interim, the jurors had observed the rest of voir dire, listened to a 5-day guilt-phase trial and extensive instructions, participated in 21/2 hours of deliberations with respect to Penry's guilt, and listened to another 5-day trial on punishment. The comments of the court and counsel during voir dire were surely a distant and convoluted memory by the time the jurors began their deliberations on Penry's sentence.~    ~    ~      48~      The State also contends that the closing arguments in the penalty phase clarified matters. Penry's counsel attempted to describe the jury's task: \"If, when you thought about mental retardation and the child abuse, you think that this guy deserves a life sentence, and not a death sentence, ... then, you get to answer one of ... those questions no. The Judge has not told you which question, and you have to give that answer, even if you decide the literally correct answer is yes. Not the easiest instruction to follow and the law does funny things sometimes.\" App. 640.~    ~    ~      49~      Again, however, this explanation only reminded the jurors that they had to answer the special issues dishonestly in order to give effect to Penry's mitigating evidence. For the reasons discussed above, such a \"clarification\" provided no real help. Moreover, even if we thought that the arguments of defense counsel could be an adequate substitute for statements of the law by the court, but see Boyde v. California, supra, at 384, the prosecutor effectively neutralized defense counsel's argument, as did the prosecutor in Penry I, by stressing the jury's duty \"[t]o follow your oath, the evidence and the law.\" App. 616. At best, the jury received mixed signals.~    ~    ~      50~      Our opinion in Penry I provided sufficient guidance as to how the trial court might have drafted the jury charge for Penry's second sentencing hearing to comply with our mandate. We specifically indicated that our concerns would have been alleviated by a jury instruction defining the term \"deliberately\" in the first special issue \"in a way that would clearly direct the jury to consider fully Penry's mitigating evidence as it bears on his personal culpability.\" 492 U.S., at 323. The trial court surely could have drafted an instruction to this effect. Indeed, Penry offered two definitions of \"deliberately\" that the trial court refused to give. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 12, 14-15.~    ~    ~      51~      A clearly drafted catchall instruction on mitigating evidence also might have complied with Penry I. Texas' current capital sentencing scheme (revised after Penry's second trial and sentencing) provides a helpful frame of reference. Texas now requires the jury to decide \"[w]hether, taking into consideration all of the evidence, including the circumstances of the offense, the defendant's character and background, and the personal moral culpability of the defendant, there is a sufficient mitigating circumstance or circumstances to warrant that a sentence of life imprisonment rather than a death sentence be imposed.\" Tex. Code Crim. Proc., Art. 37.071(2)(e)(1) (Vernon Supp. 2001).* Penry's counsel, while not conceding the issue, admitted that he \"would have a tough time saying that [Penry I] was not complied with under the new Texas procedure.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 16. At the very least, the brevity and clarity of this instruction highlight the confusing nature of the supplemental instruction actually given, and indicate that the trial court had adequate alternatives available to it as it drafted the instructions for Penry's trial.~    ~    ~      52~      Thus, to the extent the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals concluded that the substance of the jury instructions given at Penry's second sentencing hearing satisfied our mandate in Penry I, that determination was objectively unreasonable. Cf. Shafer v. South Carolina, 532 U.S. ___, ___ (2001) (slip op., at 2, 12) (holding on direct review that the South Carolina Supreme Court \"incorrectly limited\" our holding in Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154 (1994), because the court had mischaracterized \"how the State's new [capital sentencing] scheme works\"). The three special issues submitted to the jury were identical to the ones we found constitutionally inadequate as applied in Penry I. Although the supplemental instruction made mention of mitigating evidence, the mechanism it purported to create for the jurors to give effect to that evidence was ineffective and illogical. The comments of the court and counsel accomplished little by way of clarification. Any realistic assessment of the manner in which the supplemental instruction operated would therefore lead to the same conclusion we reached in Penry I: \"[A] reasonable juror could well have believed that there was no vehicle for expressing the view that Penry did not deserve to be sentenced to death based upon his mitigating evidence.\" 492 U.S., at 326.~    ~    ~      53~      The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is therefore affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      54~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        *~         Another recent development in Texas is the passage of a bill banning the execution of mentally retarded persons. See Babineck, Perry: Death-penalty measure needs analyzing, Dallas Morning News, May 31, 2001, p. 27A. As this opinion goes to press, Texas Governor Rick Perry is still in the process of deciding whether to sign the bill. Ibid.~      ~    ~    ~      55~      Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia join, concurring in Parts I, II, and III-A, and dissenting in Part III-B.~    ~    ~      56~      Two Texas juries have now deliberated and reasoned that Penry's brutal rape and murder of Pamela Carpenter warrants the death penalty under Texas law. And two opinions of this Court have now overruled those decisions on the ground that the sentencing courts should have said more about Penry's alleged mitigating evidence. Because I believe the most recent sentencing court gave the jurors an opportunity to consider the evidence Penry presented, I respectfully dissent.~    ~    ~      57~      As a habeas reviewing court, we are not called upon to propose what we believe to be the ideal instruction on how a jury should take into account evidence related to Penry's childhood and mental status. Our job is much simpler, and it is significantly removed from writing the instruction in the first instance. We must decide merely whether the conclusion of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals-that the sentencing court's supplemental instruction explaining how the jury could give effect to any mitigating value it found in Penry's evidence satisfied the requirements of Penry I-was \"objectively unreasonable.\" Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 409 (2000). See also 28 U.S.C.  2254(d)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. V).~    ~    ~      58~      At Penry's first sentencing, the court read to the jury Texas' three special issues for capital sentencing.1 The court did not instruct the jury that \"it could consider the evidence offered by Penry as mitigating evidence and that it could give mitigating effect to that evidence in imposing sentence.\" 492 U.S., at 320. The prosecutor also did not offer any way for the jury to give mitigating effect to the evidence, but instead simply reiterated that the jury was to answer the three questions and follow the law. In Penry I, this Court concluded that, \"[i]n light of the prosecutor's argument, and in the absence of appropriate jury instructions, a reasonable juror could well have believed that there was no vehicle for expressing the view that Penry did not deserve to be sentenced to death based upon his mitigating evidence.\" Id., at 326.~    ~    ~      59~      At Penry's second sentencing, the court read to the jury the same three special issues. In contrast to the first sentencing, however, the court instructed the jury at length that it could consider Penry's proffered evidence as mitigating evidence and that it could give mitigating effect to that evidence. See ante, at 5-6. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals concluded that this supplemental instruction \"allow[ed] [the jury] to consider and give effect to\" Penry's proffered mitigating evidence and therefore was \"sufficient to meet the constitutional requirements of [Penry I].\"2 Penry v. State, 903 S. W. 2d 715, 765 (1995). In my view, this decision is not only objectively reasonable but also compelled by this Court's precedents and by common sense.~    ~    ~      60~      \"In evaluating the instructions, [a court should] not engage in a technical parsing of this language of the instructions, but instead approach the instructions in the same way that the jury would-with a 'commonsense understanding of the instructions in the light of all that has taken place at the trial.' \" Johnson v. Texas, 509 U.S. 350, 368 (1993) (quoting Boyde v. California, 494 U.S. 370, 381 (1990)). The Texas court's instruction, read for common sense, or, even after a technical parsing, tells jurors that they may consider the evidence Penry presented as mitigating evidence and that, if they believe the mitigating evidence makes a death sentence inappropriate, they should answer \"no\" to one of the special issues. Given this straightforward reading of the instructions, it is objectively reasonable, if not eminently logical, to conclude that a reasonable juror would have believed he had a \"vehicle for expressing the view that Penry did not deserve to be sentenced to death based upon his mitigating evidence.\" 492 U.S., at 326.~    ~    ~      61~      It is true that Penry's proffered evidence did not fit neatly into any of the three special issues for imposing the death penalty under Texas law.3 But the sentencing court told the jury in no uncertain terms precisely how to follow this Court's directive in Penry I. First, the sentencing court instructed the jury that it could consider such evidence to be mitigating evidence. See App. 675 (\"[W]hen you deliberate on the questions posed in the special issues, you are to consider mitigating circumstances, if any, supported by the evidence presented in both phases of the trial, whether presented by the state or the defendant. A mitigating circumstance may include, but is not limited to, any aspect of the defendant's character and record or circumstances of the crime which you believe could make a death sentence inappropriate in this case\"). Next, the court explained to the jury how it must give effect to the evidence. Ibid. (\"If you find that there are any mitigating circumstances in this case, you must decide how much weight they deserve, if any, and therefore, give effect and consideration to them in assessing the defendant's personal culpability at the time you answer the special issue\"). And finally, the court unambiguously instructed: \"If you determine, when giving effect to the mitigating evidence, if any, that a life sentence, as reflected by a negative finding to the issue under consideration, rather than a death sentence, is an appropriate response to the personal culpability of the defendant, a negative finding should be given to one of the special issues.\" Ibid. (emphasis added). Without performing legal acrobatics, I cannot make the instruction confusing. And I certainly cannot do the contortions necessary to find the Texas appellate court's decision \"objectively unreasonable.\"4 I simply do not share the Court's confusion as to how a juror could consider mitigating evidence, decide whether it makes a death sentence inappropriate, and respond with a \"yes\" or \"no\" depending on the answer.~    ~    ~      62~      Curiously, this Court concludes that the supplemental instruction \"inserted 'an element of capriciousness' into the sentencing decision, 'making the jurors' power to avoid the death penalty dependent on their willingness' to elevate the supplemental instruction over the verdict form instructions.\" Ante, at 16 (quoting Roberts v. Louisiana, 428 U.S. 325, 335 (1976) (plurality opinion)). Any reference to Roberts, however, is wholly misplaced. Roberts involved a situation in which the jury was told to find the defendant guilty of a lesser included offense, unsupported by any evidence, if the jury did not want him to be sentenced to death. Id., at 334-335. In Penry's case there was no suggestion, express or implied, made to the jury that it could disregard the evidence. On the contrary, it was instructed on how to give effect to Penry's proffered evidence, as required by this Court in Penry I. Tellingly, the Roberts plurality stated in full that \"[t]here is an element of capriciousness in making the jurors' power to avoid the death penalty dependent on their willingness to accept this invitation to disregard the trial judge's instructions.\" 428 U.S., at 335 (emphasis added). In Penry's case, the judge's instructions included an explanation of how to answer the three special issues and how to give effect to the mitigating evidence.~    ~    ~      63~      Finally, contrary to the Court's claim that the jury received \"mixed signals,\" ante, at 18, it appears that it is the Texas courts that have received the mixed signals. In Jurek v. Texas, 428 U.S. 262 (1976), this Court upheld the Texas sentencing statute at issue here against attack under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. The joint opinion in Jurek concluded that the statute permits the jury \"to consider whatever evidence of mitigating circumstances the defense can bring before it\" and \"guides and focuses the jury's objective consideration of the particularized circumstances of the individual offense and the individual offender before it can impose a sentence of death.\" Id., at 273-274 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). Then, while purporting to distinguish, rather than to overrule, Jurek, this Court in Penry I determined that the same Texas statute was constitutionally insufficient by not permitting jurors to give effect to mitigating evidence. 492 U.S., at 328. See also id., at 355-356 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (explaining how Penry I contradicts Jurek's conclusions). According to the Court, an instruction informing the jury that it could give effect to the mitigating evidence was necessary. 492 U.S., at 328. And in today's decision, this Court yet again has second-guessed itself and decided that even this supplemental instruction is not constitutionally sufficient.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         The special issues are: \" '(1) whether the conduct of the defendant that caused the death of the deceased was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that the death of the deceased or another would result; \" '(2) whether there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society; and \" '(3) if raised by the evidence, whether the conduct of the defendant in killing the deceased was unreasonable in response to the provocation, if any, by the deceased.' \" Penry I, 492 U.S. 302, 310 (1989) (quoting Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.071(b) (Vernon 1981 and Supp. 1989)).~      ~      ~        2~         This Court's suggestion that the Texas court may have believed that any supplemental instruction, regardless of its substance, would satisfy Penry I's requirement, see ante, at 12, is specious. The Texas court explained that a \"jury must be given a special instruction in order to allow it to consider and give effect to such evidence;\" it quoted the full text of the supplemental instruction; and it concluded that \"a nullification instruction such as this one is sufficient to meet the constitutional requirements of [Penry I].\" 903 S. W. 2d, at 765 (emphasis added). It is quite obvious that the court based its legal conclusion on the content of the supplemental instruction.~      ~      ~        3~         I am still bewildered as to why this Court finds it unconstitutional for Texas to limit consideration of mitigating evidence to those factors relevant to the three special issues. See Graham v. Collins, 506 U.S. 461, 478 (1993) (Thomas, J., concurring). But we need not address this broader issue to uphold Penry's sentence.~      ~      ~        4~         I think we need not look beyond the court's instructions in evaluating the Texas appellate court's decision. But even if there were any doubt as to whether the instruction led the jurors to believe there was a vehicle for giving mitigating effect to Penry's evidence, the instruction was made clear \" 'in the light of all that ha[d] taken place at the trial.' \" Johnson v. Texas, 509 U.S. 350, 368 (1993). The judge and prosecutor fully explained how to give effect to mitigating evidence during the voir dire process, and defense counsel made the instruction clear in closing: \"[i]f, when you thought about mental retardation and the child abuse, you think that this guy deserves a life sentence, and not a death sentence, ... then, you get to answer one of ... those questions no,\" App. 640. Even if the jurors had forgotten what they had been told at voir dire, see ante, at 17-18, an assumption that I find questionable given our presumptions about jurors' ability to remember and follow instructions, see, e.g., Weeks v. Angelone, 528 U.S. 225, 234 (2000), the defense counsel's explanation from closing arguments would have been fresh on their minds. Despite the Court's assertion that defense counsel told the jurors to answer the questions dishonestly, ante, at 18, it seems to me that the jurors reasonably could have believed that they could honestly answer any question \"no\" if they found that the death sentence would be inappropriate given the mitigating evidence. They could follow their \" 'oath, the evidence and the law,' \" ibid., (quoting the prosecutor's statement, App. 616), by truthfully concluding that the evidence of Penry's childhood and mental status did not warrant the death penalty and by writing \"no\" next to one of the special issues.~      ~    ~    ",

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.NORFOLK SHIPBUILDING  DRYDOCK CORPORATION, PETITIONERv.CELESTINE GARRIS, administratrix of the ESTATE OF CHRISTOPHER GARRIS, DECEASED~    No. 00-346.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued April 18, 2001Decided June 4, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      In her complaint filed in the District Court, respondent alleged that her son died as a result of injuries sustained while performing sandblasting aboard a vessel berthed in the navigable waters of the United States. She further asserted that the injuries were caused by the negligence of petitioner and another, and prayed for damages under general maritime law. The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a federal claim, stating that no cause of action exists, under general maritime law, for death resulting from negligence. The Fourth Circuit reversed, explaining that although this Court had not yet recognized a maritime cause of action for wrongful death resulting from negligence, the principles contained in Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc., 398 U.S. 375, made such an action appropriate.~      Held: The general maritime cause of action recognized in Moragne-for death caused by violation of maritime duties, id., at 409-is available for the negligent breach of a maritime duty of care. Although Moragne's opinion did not limit its rule to any particular maritime duty, Moragne's facts were limited to the duty of seaworthiness, and so the issue of wrongful death for negligence has remained technically open. There is no rational basis, however, for distinguishing negligence from unseaworthiness. Negligence is no less a maritime duty than seaworthiness, and the choice-of-law and remedial anomalies provoked by withholding a wrongful death remedy are no less severe. Nor is a negligence action precluded by any of the three relevant federal statutes that provide remedies for injuries and death suffered in admiralty: the Jones Act, the Death on the High Seas Act, and the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. Because of Congress's extensive involvement in legislating causes of action for maritime personal injuries, it will be the better course, in many cases that assert new claims beyond what those statutes have seen fit to allow, to leave further development to Congress. See, e.g., American Dredging Co. v. Miller, 510 U.S. 443, 455. The cause of action recognized today, however, is new only in the most technical sense. The general maritime law has recognized the tort of negligence for more than a century, and it has been clear since Moragne that breaches of a maritime duty are actionable when they cause death, as when they cause injury.

App. to Pet. for Cert. 53. The injuries were suffered while Garris was performing sandblasting work aboard the USNS Maj. Stephen W. Pless in the employ of Tidewater Temps, Inc., a subcontractor for Mid-Atlantic Coatings, Inc., which was in turn a subcontractor for petitioner Norfolk Shipbuilding  Drydock Corporation. And the injuries were caused, the complaint continued, by the negligence of petitioner and one of its other subcontractors, since dismissed from this case. Because the vessel was berthed in the navigable waters of the United States when Garris was injured, respondent invoked federal admiralty jurisdiction, U.S. Const., Art. III, 2, cl. 1; 28 U.S.C.  1333 and prayed for damages under general maritime law. She also asserted claims under the Virginia wrongful death statute, Va. Code Ann. 8.01-50 to 8.01-56 (2000).~    ~    ~      3~      The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a federal claim, for the categorical reason that \"no cause of action exists, under general maritime law, for death of a nonseaman in state territorial waters resulting from negligence.\" No. Civ. A. 2:98CV382, 1998 WL 1108934, *1 (ED Va., Aug. 31, 1998) (unpublished). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed and remanded for further proceedings, explaining that although this Court had not yet recognized a maritime cause of action for wrongful death resulting from negligence, the principles contained in our decision in Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc., 398 U.S. 375 (1970), made such an action appropriate. 210 F.3d 209, 211 (2000). Judge Hall concurred in the judgment because, in her view, Moragne had itself recognized the action. Id., at 222-227. The Court of Appeals denied petitioner's suggestion for rehearing en banc, with two judges dissenting. 215 F.3d 420 (2000). We granted certiorari. 531 U.S. 1050 (2000).~    ~    II~    ~      4~      Three of four issues of general maritime law are settled, and the fourth is before us. It is settled that the general maritime law imposes duties to avoid unseaworthiness and negligence, see, e.g., Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, Inc., 362 U.S. 539, 549-550 (1960) (unseaworthiness); Leathers v. Blessing, 105 U.S. 626, 630 (1882) (negligence), that nonfatal injuries caused by the breach of either duty are compensable, see, e.g., Mahnich v. Southern S. S. Co., 321 U.S. 96, 102-103 (1944) (unseaworthiness); Robins Dry Dock  Repair Co. v. Dahl, 266 U.S. 449, 457 (1925) (negligence), and that death caused by breach of the duty of seaworthiness is also compensable, Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc., supra, at 409. Before us is the question whether death caused by negligence should, or must under direction of a federal statute, be treated differently.~    ~    ~      5~      * For more than 80 years, from 1886 until 1970, all four issues were considered resolved, though the third not in the manner we have just described. The governing rule then was the rule of The Harrisburg, 119 U.S. 199, 213 (1886): Although the general maritime law provides relief for injuries caused by the breach of maritime duties, it does not provide relief for wrongful death. The Harrisburg said that rule was compelled by existence of the same rule at common law, id., at 213-214-although it acknowledged, id., at 205-212, that admiralty courts had held that damages for wrongful death were recoverable under maritime law, see also Moragne, supra, at 387-388 (listing cases).~    ~    ~      6~      In 1969, however, we granted certiorari in Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc., supra, for the express purpose of considering \"whether The Harrisburg ... should any longer be regarded as acceptable law.\" 398 U.S., at 375-376. We inquired whether the rule of The Harrisburg was defensible under either the general maritime law or the policy displayed in the maritime statutes Congress had since enacted, 398 U.S., at 379-393, whether those statutes pre-empted judicial action overruling The Harrisburg, 398 U.S., at 393-403, whether stare decisis required adherence to The Harrisburg, 398 U.S., at 403-405, and whether insuperable practical difficulties would accompany The Harrisburg's overruling, 398 U.S., at 405-408. Answering every question no, we overruled the case and declared a new rule of maritime law: \"We ... hold that an action does lie under general maritime law for death caused by violation of maritime duties.\" Id., at 409.~    ~    ~      7~      As we have noted in an earlier opinion, the wrongful-death rule of Moragne was not limited to any particular maritime duty, Yamaha Motor Corp., U.S. A. v. Calhoun, 516 U.S. 199, 214, n. 11 (1996) (dictum), but Moragne's facts were limited to the duty of seaworthiness, and so the issue of wrongful death for negligence has remained technically open. We are able to find no rational basis, however, for distinguishing negligence from seaworthiness. It is no less a distinctively maritime duty than seaworthiness: The common-law duties of care have not been adopted and retained unmodified by admiralty, but have been adjusted to fit their maritime context, see, e.g., Kermarec v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 358 U.S. 625, 630-632 (1959), and a century ago the maritime law exchanged the common law's rule of contributory negligence for one of comparative negligence, see, e.g., The Max Morris, 137 U.S. 1, 14-15 (1890); Pope  Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, 346 U.S. 406, 408-409 (1953). Consequently the \"tensions and discrepancies\" in our precedent arising \"from the necessity to accommodate state remedial statutes to exclusively maritime substantive concepts\"-which ultimately drove this Court in Moragne to abandon The Harrisburg, see 398 U.S., at 401-were no less pronounced with maritime negligence than with unseaworthiness. In fact, both cases cited by Moragne to exemplify those discrepancies involved maritime negligence, see id., at 401 (citing Hess v. United States, 361 U.S. 314 (1960); Goett v. Union Carbide Corp., 361 U.S. 340 (1960) (per curiam)); see also Nelson v. United States, 639 F.2d 469, 473 (CA9 1980) (opinion by then-Judge Kennedy) (concluding that uniformity concerns required Moragne's application to negligence). It is true, as petitioner observes, that we have held admiralty accommodation of state remedial statutes to be constitutionally permissible, see, e.g., Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, 257 U.S. 233, 242 (1921); The Tungus v. Skovgaard, 358 U.S. 588, 594 (1959),1 but that does not resolve the issue here: whether requiring such an accommodation by refusing to recognize a federal remedy is preferable as a matter of maritime policy. We think it is not.~    ~    ~      8~      The choice-of-law anomaly occasioned by providing a federal remedy for injury but not death is no less strange when the duty is negligence than when it is seaworthiness. Of two victims injured at the same instant in the same location by the same negligence, only one would be covered by federal law, provided only that the other died of his injuries. See, e.g., Byrd v. Napoleon Avenue Ferry Co., 125 F. Supp. 573, 578 (ED La. 1954) (in case involving single car accident on ferry, applying state negligence law to claim for deceased husband's wrongful death but federal maritime negligence law to claim for surviving wife's injuries), aff'd, 227 F.2d 958 (CA5 1955) (per curiam). And cutting off the law's remedy at the death of the injured person is no less \"a striking departure from the result dictated by elementary principles in the law of remedies,\" Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc., 398 U.S., at 381, when the duty breached is negligence than when it is seaworthiness. \"Where existing law imposes a primary duty, violations of which are compensable if they cause injury, nothing in ordinary notions of justice suggests that a violation should be nonactionable simply because it was serious enough to cause death.\" Ibid. Finally, the maritime policy favoring recovery for wrongful death that Moragne found implicit in federal statutory law cannot be limited to unseaworthiness, for both of the federal acts on which Moragne relied permit recovery for negligence, see Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. App. 688(a); Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA), 46 U.S.C. App. 761 et seq.; see also Engel v. Davenport, 271 U.S. 33, 36-37 (1926) (Jones Act). In sum, a negligent breach of a maritime duty of care being assumed by the posture of this case,2 no rational basis within the maritime law exists for denying respondent the recovery recognized by Moragne for the death of her son.~    ~    B~    ~      9~      Weightier arguments against recognizing a wrongful-death action for negligence may be found not within general maritime law but without, in the federal statutes that provide remedies for injuries and death suffered in admiralty. As we explained in Miles v. Apex Marine Corp., 498 U.S. 19, 27 (1990), \"[w]e no longer live in an era when seamen and their loved ones must look primarily to the courts as a source of substantive legal protection from injury and death; Congress ... [has] legislated extensively in these areas.\" And, even in admiralty, \"we have no authority to substitute our views for those expressed by Congress in a duly enacted statute.\" Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, 436 U.S. 618, 626 (1978). Hence, when a statute resolves a particular issue, we have held that the general maritime law must comply with that resolution. See, e.g., Dooley v. Korean Air Lines Co., 524 U.S. 116, 123-124 (1998). We must therefore make careful study of the three statutes relevant here.~    ~    ~      10~      * The Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. App. 688(a), establishes a cause of action for negligence for injuries or death suffered in the course of employment, but only for seamen. See generally Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515 U.S. 347 (1995) (describing test for seaman status). Respondent's son, who was not a seaman, was not covered by the Jones Act, and we have held that the Jones Act bears no implication for actions brought by nonseamen. See, e.g., American Export Lines, Inc. v. Alvez, 446 U.S. 274, 282-283 (1980). Moreover, even as to seamen, we have held that general maritime law may provide wrongful-death actions predicated on duties beyond those that the Jones Act imposes. See, e.g., Miles v. Apex Marine Corp., supra, at 28-30 (seaworthiness). The Jones Act does not preclude respondent's negligence action.~    ~    ~      11~      DOHSA creates wrongful-death actions for negligence and unseaworthiness, see Moragne, supra, at 395, but only by the personal representatives of people killed \"beyond a marine league from the shore of any State,\" 46 U.S.C. App. 761. Respondent's son was killed in state territorial waters, where DOHSA expressly provides that its provisions \"shall ... [not] apply,\" 767. In Moragne, after discussing the anomalies that would result if DOHSA were interpreted to preclude federal maritime causes of action even where its terms do not apply, 398 U.S., at 395-396, we held that DOHSA \"was not intended to preclude the availability of a remedy for wrongful death under general maritime law in situations not covered by the Act,\" id., at 402. Or, \"[t]o put it another way, ... no intention appears that the Act have the effect of foreclosing any nonstatutory federal remedies that might be found appropriate to effectuate the policies of general maritime law.\" Id., at 400. DOHSA therefore does not pre-empt respondent's negligence action.~    ~    ~      12~      Finally, the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA), 44 Stat. 1424, as amended, 33 U.S.C.  901 et seq., provides nonseaman maritime workers such as respondent's son, see 902(3) (defining covered employees), with no-fault workers' compensation claims (against their employer, 904(b)) and negligence claims (against the vessel, 905(b)) for injury and death. As to those two defendants, the LHWCA expressly pre-empts all other claims, 905(a), (b); but cf. Sun Ship, Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 447 U.S. 715, 723-726 (1980) (holding some state workers' compensation claims against employer not pre-empted), but it expressly preserves all claims against third parties, 933(a), (i). And petitioner is a third party: It neither employed respondent's son nor owned the vessel on which he was killed.~    ~    ~      13~      Petitioner argues, however, that 933's preservation-of-other-claims provisions express Congress's intent to reserve all other wrongful-death actions to the States. That argument cannot withstand our precedent, since we have consistently interpreted 933 to preserve federal maritime claims as well as state claims, see, e.g., Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, 328 U.S. 85, 100-102 (1946); Cooper Stevedoring Co. v. Fritz Kopke, Inc., 417 U.S. 106, 113 (1974), including maritime negligence claims, see, e.g., Pope  Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, 346 U.S., at 411-413 (upholding recovery for negligence under maritime law by longshoreman covered by the LHWCA). Petitioner's further contention-that the policy implicit in the 1972 amendments to the LHWCA bars a maritime action for wrongful death though the text of those amendments (which left 933 unchanged) permits it-cannot succeed. We do not find, as petitioner does, an anti-maritime-wrongful-death policy implicit in the amendment to 905(b), see 86 Stat. 1263, which eliminated covered workers' unseaworthiness claims against a vessel, see, e.g., Bloomer v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 445 U.S. 74, 83 (1980) (\"Congress abolished the unseaworthiness remedy for longshoremen, recognized in Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, 328 U.S. 85 (1946)\"). That amendment was directed not at wrongful death in particular, but at unseaworthiness generally, see Edmonds v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 443 U.S. 256, 262 (1979) (\"Congress acted in 1972, among other things, to eliminate the shipowner's liability to the longshoreman for unseaworthiness ...-in other words, to overrule Sieracki\"). To the extent the amendment to 905(b) reflects any policy relevant here, it is in expressly ratifying longshore and harbor workers' claims against the vessel for negligence, see id., at 259-260. The LHWCA therefore does not preclude this negligence action for wrongful death.~    ~    2~    ~      14~      Even beyond the express pre-emptive reach of federal maritime statutes, however, we have acknowledged that they contain a further prudential effect. \"While there is an established and continuing tradition of federal common lawmaking in admiralty, that law is to be developed, insofar as possible, to harmonize with the enactments of Congress in the field.\" American Dredging Co. v. Miller, 510 U.S. 443, 455 (1994). Cf. Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S. A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308, 332-333 (1999) (equitable lawmaking power of bankruptcy courts limited by statute). Because of Congress's extensive involvement in legislating causes of action for maritime personal injuries, it will be the better course, in many cases that assert new claims beyond what those statutes have seen fit to allow, to leave further development to Congress. The cause of action we recognize today, however, is new only in the most technical sense. The general maritime law has recognized the tort of negligence for more than a century, and it has been clear since Moragne that breaches of a maritime duty are actionable when they cause death, as when they cause injury. Congress's occupation of this field is not yet so extensive as to preclude us from recognizing what is already logically compelled by our precedents.~    ~    ~      15~      * * *~    ~    ~      16~      The maritime cause of action that Moragne established for unseaworthiness is equally available for negligence.~    ~    ~      17~      We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.~    ~    ~      18~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      19~      Ginsburg, J., filed an opinion concurring in part, in which Souter and Breyer, JJ., joined.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         The issue addressed in Yamaha Motor Corp., U.S. A. v. Calhoun, 516 U.S. 199 (1996), whether state remedies may in some instances supplement a federal maritime remedy, is not presented by this case, where respondent is no longer pursuing state remedies. After the District Court dismissed her state-law claim on jurisdictional grounds, respondent re-filed it in state court, where it was resolved against her. See Brief for Respondent 2, n. 1.~      ~      ~        2~         The District Court dismissed the case for the threshold reason that, regardless of a negligent breach, there could be no recovery. See supra, at 2. Petitioner therefore will be free to present its arguments regarding duty and breach on remand to the extent they have been preserved.~      ~    ~    ~      20~      Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Souter and Justice Breyer join, concurring in part.~    ~    ~      21~      I join all but Part II-B-2 of the Court's opinion.~    ~    ~      22~      Following the reasoning in Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc., 398 U.S. 375 (1970), the Court today holds that the maritime cause of action Moragne established for unseaworthiness is equally available for negligence. I agree with the Court's clear opinion with one reservation. In Part II-B-2, the Court counsels: \"Because of Congress's extensive involvement in legislating causes of action for maritime personal injuries, it will be the better course, in many cases that assert new claims beyond what those statutes ... allow, to leave further development to Congress.\" Ante, at 9. Moragne itself, however, tugs in the opposite direction. Inspecting the relevant legislation, the Court in Moragne found no measures counseling against the judicial elaboration of general maritime law there advanced. See 398 U.S., at 399-402, 409; see also id., at 393 (\"Where death is caused by the breach of a duty imposed by federal maritime law, Congress has established a policy favoring recovery in the absence of a legislative direction to except a particular class of cases.\"). In accord with Moragne, I see development of the law in admiralty as a shared venture in which \"federal common lawmaking\" does not stand still, but \"harmonize[s] with the enactments of Congress in the field.\" Ante, at 9 (quoting American Dredging Co. v. Miller, 510 U.S. 443, 455 (1994)). I therefore do not join the Court's dictum.~    ~    ",

Readers are requested to notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D. C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.UNITED DOMINION INDUSTRIES, INC., PETITIONERv.UNITED STATES~    No. 00-157.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued March 26, 2001Decided June 4, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, a \"net operating loss\" (NOL) results from deductions in excess of gross income for a given year. 26 U.S. C. 172(c). A taxpayer may carry its NOL either backward or forward to other tax years in order to set off its lean years against its lush years. 172(b)(1)(A). The carryback period for \"product liability loss[es]\" is 10 years. 172(b)(1)(I). Because a product liability loss (PLL) is the total of a taxpayer's product liability expenses (PLEs) up to the amount of its NOL, 172(j)(1), a taxpayer with a positive annual income, and thus no NOL, may have PLEs but can have no PLL. An affiliated group of corporations may file a single consolidated return. 1501. Treasury Regulations provide that such a group's \"consolidated taxable income\" (CTI), or, alternatively, its \"consolidated net operating loss\" (CNOL), is determined by taking into account several items, the first of which is the \"separate taxable income\" (STI) of each group member. In calculating STI, the member must disregard items such as capital gains and losses, which are considered, and factored into CTI or CNOL, on a consolidated basis. Petitioner's predecessor in interest, AMCA International Corporation, was the parent of an affiliated group filing consolidated returns for the years 1983 through 1986. In each year, AMCA reported CNOL exceeding the aggregate of its 26 individual members' PLEs. Five group members with PLEs reported positive STIs. Nonetheless, AMCA included those PLEs in determining its PLL for 10-year carryback under a \"single-entity\" approach in which it compared the group's CNOL and total PLEs to determine the group's total PLL. In contrast, the Government's \"separate-member\" approach compares each affiliate's STI and PLEs in order to determine whether each affiliate suffers a PLL, and only then combines any PLLs of the individual affiliates to determine a consolidated PLL. Under this approach, PLEs incurred by an affiliate with positive STI cannot contribute to a PLL. In 1986 and 1987, AMCA petitioned the Internal Revenue Service for refunds based on its PLL calculations. The IRS ruled in AMCA's favor, but was reversed by a joint congressional committee that controls refunds exceeding a certain threshold. AMCA then filed this refund action. The District Court applied AMCA's single-entity approach, concluding that so long as the affiliated group's consolidated return reflects CNOL in excess of the group's aggregate PLEs, the total of those expenses is a PLL that may be carried back. In reversing, the Fourth Circuit applied the separate-member approach.~      Held: An affiliated group's PLL must be figured on a consolidated, single-entity basis, not by aggregating PLLs separately determined company by company. Pp. 5-15.~      (a) The single-entity approach to calculating an affiliated group's PLL is straightforward. The first step in applying 172(j)'s definition of PLL requires a taxpayer filing a consolidated return to calculate an NOL. The Code and regulations governing affiliated groups of corporations filing consolidated returns provide only one definition of NOL: \"consolidated\" NOL. The absence of a separate NOL for a group member in this context is underscored by the fact that the regulations provide a measure of separate NOL in a different context, for any year in which an affiliated corporation files a separate return. The exclusive definition of NOL as CNOL at the consolidated level is important. Neither the Code nor the regulations indicate that the essential relationship between NOL and PLL for a consolidated group differs from their relationship for a conventional corporate taxpayer. Comparable treatment of PLL for the group and the conventional taxpayer can be achieved only if PLEs are compared with the loss amount at the consolidated level after CNOL has been determined, for CNOL is the only NOL measure for the group. An approach based on comparable treatment is also (relatively) easy to understand and to apply. Pp. 5-7.~      (b) The case for the separate-member approach is not so easily made. Because there is no NOL below the consolidated level, there is nothing for comparison with PLEs to produce a PLL at any stage before the CNOL calculation. Thus, a separate-member proponent must identify some figure in the consolidated return scheme with a plausible analogy to NOL at the affiliated corporations level. An individual member's STI is not analogous, for it excludes several items that an individual taxpayer would normally count in computing income or loss, but which an affiliated group may tally only at the consolidated level. The \"separate net operating loss,\" Treas. Reg. 1.1502-79(a)(3), used by the Fourth Circuit fares no better. Although that figure accounts for some gains or losses that STI does not, 1.1502-79(a)(3)'s purpose is to allocate CNOL to an affiliate member seeking to carry back a loss to a year in which the member was not part of the consolidated group. Such returns are not at issue here. Pp. 8-11.~      (c) Several objections to the single-entity approach-that it allows affiliated groups a double deduction, that the omission of PLEs from the series of items that Treas. Reg. 1.1502-12 requires to be tallied at the consolidation level indicates that PLEs were not meant to be tallied at that level, and that the single-entity approach would permit significant tax avoidance abuses-are rejected. Pp. 11-15.~      208 F.3d 452, reversed and remanded.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT~      Souter, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      Under 172(b)(1)(I) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, a taxpayer may carry back its \"product liability loss\" up to 10 years in order to offset prior years' income. The issue here is the method for calculating the product liability loss of an affiliated group of corporations electing to file a consolidated federal income tax return. We hold that the group's product liability loss must be figured on a consolidated basis in the first instance, and not by aggregating product liability losses separately determined company by company.~    ~    ~      2~      * A \"net operating loss\" results from deductions in excess of gross income for a given year. 26 U.S.C.  172(c).1 Under 172(b)(1)(A), a taxpayer may carry its net operating loss either backward to past tax years or forward to future tax years in order to \"set off its lean years against its lush years, and to strike something like an average taxable income computed over a period longer than one year,\" Libson Shops, Inc. v. Koehler, 353 U.S. 382, 386 (1957).~    ~    ~      3~      Although the normal carryback period was at the time three years, in 1978, Congress authorized a special 10-year carryback for \"product liability loss[es],\" 26 U.S.C.  172(b)(1)(I), since, it understood, losses of this sort tend to be particularly \"large and sporadic.\" Joint Committee on Taxation, 95th Cong., General Explanation of the Revenue Act of 1978, 232 (Comm. Print 1979). The Code defines \"product liability loss,\" for a given tax year, as the lesser of (1) the taxpayer's \"net operating loss for such year\" and (2) its allowable deductions attributable to product liability \"expenses.\" 26 U.S.C.  172(j)(1). In other words, a taxpayer's product liability loss (PLL) is the total of its product liability expenses (PLEs), limited to the amount of its net operating loss (NOL). By definition, then, a taxpayer with positive annual income, and thus no NOL, may have PLEs but can have no PLL.2~    ~    ~      4~      Instead of requiring each member company of \"[a]n affiliated group of corporations\" to file a separate tax return, the Code permits the group to file a single consolidated return, 26 U.S.C.  1501 and leaves it to the Secretary of the Treasury to work out the details by promulgating regulations governing such returns, 1502. Under Treas. Regs. 1.1502-11(a) and 1.1502-21(f),3 an affiliated group's \"consolidated taxable income\" (CTI), or, alternatively, its \"consolidated net operating loss\" (CNOL), is determined by \"taking into account\" several items. The first is the \"separate taxable income\" (STI) of each group member. A member's STI (whether positive or negative) is computed as though the member were a separate corporation (i.e., by netting income and expenses), but subject to several important \"modifications.\" Treas. Reg. 1.1502-12. These modifications require a group member calculating its STI to disregard, among other items, its capital gains and losses, charitable-contribution deductions, and dividends-received deductions. Ibid. These excluded items are accounted for on a consolidated basis, that is, they are combined at the level of the group filing the single return, where deductions otherwise attributable to one member (say, for a charitable contribution) can offset income received by another (from a capital gain, for example). Treas. Regs. 1.1502-11(a)(3)-(8); 1.1502-21(f)(2) to (6). A consolidated group's CTI or CNOL, therefore, is the sum of each member's STI, plus or minus a handful of items considered on a consolidated basis.~    ~    II~    ~      5~      Petitioner United Dominion's predecessor in interest, AMCA International Corporation, was the parent of an affiliated group of corporations that properly elected to file consolidated tax returns for the years 1983 through 1986. In each of these years, AMCA reported CNOL (the lowest being $85 million and the highest, $140 million) that exceeded the aggregate of its 26 individual members' PLEs ($3.5 million to $6.5 million). This case focuses on the PLEs of five of AMCA's member companies, which, together, generated roughly $205,000 in PLEs in 1983, $1.6 million in 1984, $1.3 million in 1985, and $250,000 in 1986. No one disputes these amounts or their characterization as PLEs. See 208 F.3d 452, 453 (CA4 2000) (\"The parties agree\" with respect to the amount of \"the product liability expenses incurred by the five group members in the relevant years\"). Rather, the sole question here is whether the AMCA affiliated group may include these amounts on its consolidated return, in determining its PLL for 10-year carryback. The question arises because of the further undisputed fact that in each of the relevant tax years, each of the five companies in question (with minor exceptions not relevant here), reported a positive STI.~    ~    ~      6~      AMCA answered this question by following what commentators have called a \"single-entity\" approach4 to calculating its \"consolidated\" PLL. For each tax year, AMCA (1) calculated its CNOL pursuant to Treas. Reg. 1.1502-11(a), and (2) aggregated its individual members' PLEs. Because, as noted above, for each tax year AMCA's CNOL was greater than the sum of its members' PLEs, AMCA treated the full amount of the PLEs as consolidated PLL eligible for 10-year carryback. In AMCA's view, the fact that several member companies throwing off large PLEs also, when considered separately, generated positive taxable income was of no significance.~    ~    ~      7~      From the Government's perspective, however, the fact that the several affiliated members with PLEs also generated positive separate taxable income is of critical significance. According to the Government's methodology, which we will call the \"separate-member\" approach,5 PLEs incurred by an affiliate with positive separate taxable income cannot contribute to a PLL eligible for 10-year carryback. Whereas AMCA compares the group's total income (or loss) and total PLEs in an effort to determine the group's total PLL, the Government compares each affiliate's STI and PLEs in order to determine whether each affiliate suffers a PLL, and only then combines any PLLs of the individual affiliates to determine a consolidated PLL amount.~    ~    ~      8~      In 1986 and 1987, AMCA petitioned the Internal Revenue Service for refunds of taxes based on its PLL calculations. The IRS first ruled in AMCA's favor but was reversed by the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation of the United States Congress, which controls refunds exceeding a certain threshold, 26 U.S.C.  6405(a). AMCA then filed this refund action in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina. The District Court agreed with AMCA that an affiliated group's PLL is determined on a single-entity basis, and held that, so long as the group's consolidated return reflects CNOL in excess of the group's aggregate PLEs, the total of those expenses (including those incurred by members with positive separate taxable income) is a PLL that \"may be carried back the full ten years.\" No. 3:95-CV-341-MU (June 19, 1998), App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed, and held that \"determining 'product liability loss' separately for each group member is correct and consistent with [Treasury] regulations.\" 208 F.3d, at 458.~    ~    ~      9~      Because the Fourth Circuit's separate-member approach to calculating PLL conflicted with the Sixth Circuit's adoption of the single-entity approach in Intermet Corp. v. Commissioner, 209 F.3d 901 (CA6 2000), we granted certiorari, 531 U. S 1009 (2000).6 We now reverse.~    ~    III~    ~      10~      The case for the single-entity approach to calculating an affiliated group's PLL is straightforward. Section 172(j)(1) defines a taxpayer's \"product liability loss\" for a given tax year as the lesser of its \"net operating loss for such year\" and its product liability \"expenses.\" In order to apply this definition, the taxpayer first determines whether it has taxable income or NOL, and in making that calculation it subtracts PLEs. If the result is NOL, the taxpayer then makes a simple comparison between the NOL figure and the total PLEs. The PLE total becomes the PLL to the extent it does not exceed NOL. That is, until NOL has been determined, there is no PLL.~    ~    ~      11~      The first step in applying the definition and methodology of PLL to a taxpayer filing a consolidated return thus requires the calculation of NOL. As United Dominion correctly points out, the Code and regulations governing affiliated groups of corporations filing consolidated returns provide only one definition of NOL: \"consolidated\" NOL, see Treas. Reg. 1.1502-21(f). There is no definition of separate NOL for a member of an affiliated group. Indeed, the fact that Treasury Regulations do provide a measure of separate NOL in a different context, for an affiliated corporation as to any year in which it filed a separate return, infra, at ___, underscores the absence of such a measure for an affiliated corporation filing as a group member. Given this apparently exclusive definition of NOL as CNOL in the instance of affiliated entities with a consolidated return (and for reasons developed below, infra, at ___) we think it is fair to say, as United Dominion says, that the concept of separate NOL \"simply does not exist.\" Brief for Petitioner 15.7 The exclusiveness of NOL at the consolidated level as CNOL is important here for the following reasons. The Code's authorization of consolidated group treatment contains no indication that for a consolidated group the essential relationship between NOL and PLL will differ from their relationship for a conventional corporate taxpayer. Nor does any Treasury Regulation purport to change the relationship in the consolidated context. If, then, the relationship is to remain essentially the same, the key to understanding it lies in the regulations' definition of net operating loss exclusively at the consolidated level. Working back from that, PLEs should be considered first in calculating CNOL, and they are: because any PLE of an affiliate affects the calculation of its STI, that same PLE necessarily affects the CTI or CNOL in exactly the same way, dollar for dollar. And because, by definition, there is no NOL measure for a consolidated return group or any affiliate except CNOL, PLEs cannot be compared with any NOL to produce PLL until CNOL has been calculated. Then, and only then in the case of the consolidated filer, can total PLEs be compared with a net operating loss. In sum, comparable treatment of PLL in the instances of the usual corporate taxpayer and group filing a consolidated return can be achieved only if the comparison of PLEs with a limiting loss amount occurs at the consolidated level after CNOL has been determined. This approach resting on comparable treatment has a further virtue entitled to some weight in case of doubt: it is (relatively) easy to understand and to apply.~    ~    ~      12~      The case for the separate-member approach, advanced (in one variant) by the Government and adopted (on a different rationale) by the Court of Appeals, is not so easily made. In the analysis of comparable treatment just set out, of course, there is no NOL below the consolidated level and hence nothing for comparison with PLEs to produce PLL at any stage before the CNOL calculation. At the least, then, a proponent of the separate-member approach must identify some figure in the consolidated return scheme that could have a plausible analogy to NOL at the level of the affiliated corporations. See A. Dubroff, J. Blanchard, J. Broadbent,  K. Duvall, Federal Income Taxation of Corporations Filing Consolidated Returns 41.04[06], p. 41-75 (2d ed. 2000) (hereinafter Dubroff) (\"Even if separate entity treatment was appropriate, it is unclear how a member with [PLEs] would compute its separate NOL\"). The Government and the Court of Appeals have suggested different substitute measures. Neither one works.~    ~    ~      13~      The Government has argued that an individual group member's STI, as determined under Treas. Reg. 1.1502-12, is analogous to a \"separate\" NOL, so that an affiliate's STI may be compared with its PLEs in order to determine any separate PLL. An individual member's PLL would be the amount of its separate PLEs up to the amount of its negative STI; a member having positive STI could have no PLL.~    ~    ~      14~      The Government claims that an STI-based comparison places the group member closest to the position it would have occupied if it had filed a separate return. But that is simply not so. We have seen already that the calculation of a group member's STI by definition excludes several items that an individual taxpayer would normally account for in computing income or loss, but which an affiliated group may tally only at the consolidated level, such as capital gains and losses, charitable-contribution deductions, and dividends-received deductions. Treas. Reg. 1.1502-12(j) to (n). Owing to these exclusions, an affiliate's STI will tend to be inflated by eliminating deductions it would have taken if it had filed separately, or deflated by eliminating an income item like capital gain.~    ~    ~      15~      When pushed, the Government concedes that STI is \"not necessarily equivalent to the income or [NOL] figure that the corporation would have computed if it had filed a separate return.\" Brief for United States 21, n. 14. But, the Government claims, \"[t]here has never been a taxpayer with [PLEs] who had a positive [STI] but a negative separate [NOL].\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 27. In other words, the Government says that the deductions excluded from STI have never once made a difference and, therefore, that STI is, in fact, a decent enough proxy for a group member's \"separate\" NOL. But whether or not the excluded items have made a difference in the past, or make a difference here, they certainly could make a difference and, given the potential importance of some of the deductions involved (a large charitable contribution, for example), it is not hard to see how the difference could favor the Government.~    ~    ~      16~      The Court of Appeals was therefore right to reject the Government's reliance on STI as a functional surrogate for an affiliate's \"separate\" NOL. 208 F.3d, at 459-460. But what the Court of Appeals used in place of STI fares no better. The court relied on Treas. Reg. 1.1502-79, which contains a definition of \"separate net operating loss\" that the court believed to be \"analogous to an individual's 'net operating loss' on a separate return.\" 208 F.3d, at 460. Section 1.1502-79(a)(3) provides that, \"[f]or purposes of this subparagraph,\" the \"separate net operating loss of a member of the group shall be determined under 1.1502-12 ... , adjusted for the ... items taken into account in the computation of\" the CNOL. As the Court of Appeals said, the directive of 1.1502-79(a)(3) (unlike the definition of STI) \"takes into account, for example, [a] member's charitable contributions\" and other consolidated deductions. 208 F.3d, at 460-461.~    ~    ~      17~      But this sounds too good. It is true that, insofar as 1.1502-79(a)(3) accounts for gains and losses that STI does not, it gets closer to a commonsense notion of a group member's \"separate\" NOL than STI does. But the fact that 1.1502-79(a)(3) improves on STI simply by undoing what 1.1502-12 requires in defining STI is suspicious, and it turns out that the suspicion is justified. Section 1.1502-79(a)(3) unbakes the cake for only one reason, and that reason has no application here. The definition on which the Court of Appeals relied applies, by its terms, only \"for purposes of\" 1.1502-79(a)(3), and context makes clear that the purpose is to provide a way to allocate CNOL to an affiliate member that seeks to carry back a loss to a \"separate return year,\" that is, to a year in which the member was not part of the consolidated group. See Treas. Reg. 1.1502-79 (titled \"Separate return years\"); 1.1502-79(a) (titled \"Carryover and carryback of [CNOL] to separate return years\"); 1.1502-79(a)(1) (\"[i]f a [CNOL] can be carried ... to a separate return year ...\"). No separate return years are at issue before us; all NOL carrybacks relevant here apply to years in which the five corporations were affiliated in the group. The Court of Appeals thus applied concepts addressing separate return years to a determination for a consolidated return year, without any statutory or regulatory basis for doing so. Cf. 49 Fed. Reg. 30530 (1984) (\"[A]lthough the consolidated net operating loss is apportioned to individual members for purposes of carry backs to separate return years [under 1.1502-79(a)], the apportioned amounts are not separate NOLs of each member\"). Hence, while 1.1502-79 might not distort an affiliate's separate NOL in the same way that STI does, the facial inapplicability of that regulation only underscores the exclusive concern of 1.1502-11(a) with consolidated NOL.~    ~    ~      18~      In sum, neither method for computing PLL on a separate-member basis squares with the notion of comparability as applied to consolidated return regulations. On the contrary, by expressly and exclusively defining NOL as CNOL, the regulations support the position that group members' PLEs should be aggregated and the affiliated group's PLL determined on a consolidated, single-entity basis.~    ~    IV~    ~      19~      Several objections have been raised to a single-entity approach to calculating PLL that we have not considered yet. First, the Government insists that a single-entity rule allows affiliated groups a \"double deduction.\" The Government argues that because PLEs are not included among the specific items (charitable-contribution deductions, etc.) for which consolidated, single-entity treatment is required under Treas. Reg. 1.1502-12, PLEs are \"consumed\" or \"used up\" in computing members' STIs, which, pursuant to Treas. Regs. 1.1502-11(a) and 1.1502-21(f), are then used to calculate the group's CTI or CNOL. According to the Government, to permit the use of PLEs first to reduce an individual member's STI and then to contribute to an aggregate PLL for carryback purposes would be tantamount to a double deduction.~    ~    ~      20~      The double-deduction argument may have superficial appeal, but any appeal it has rests on a fundamental misconception of the function of STI in computing an affiliated group's tax liability. Calculation of a group member's STI is not in and of itself the basis for any tax event, and there is no separate tax saving when STI is calculated; that occurs only when deductions on the consolidated return equal income and (if they exceed income and produce a CNOL) are carried back against prior income. STI is merely an accounting construct devised as an interim step in computing a group's CTI or CNOL; it \"has no other purpose.\" Intermet, 209 F.3d, at 906 (\"A member's STI is simply a step along the way to calculating the group's taxable income or CNOL\"). The fact that a group member's PLEs reduce its STI, which in turn either reduces the group's CTI or contributes to its CNOL \"dollar for dollar,\" ibid., is of no other moment.8 If there were anything wrong in what AMCA proposes to do, it would be wrong in relation to AMCA's CNOL and its use for any carryback. Yet, as noted above, no one here disputes that the group members had PLEs in the total amount claimed or that the AMCA group is entitled to carry back the full amount of its CNOL to offset income in prior years. The only question is what portion, if any, of AMCA's CNOL is PLL and, as such, eligible for 10-year, as opposed to 3-year carryback treatment. There is no more of a double deduction with a 10-year carryback than one for three years.~    ~    ~      21~      A second objection was the reason that the Court of Appeals rejected the single-entity approach. That court attached dispositive significance to the fact that, while the Treasury Regulation we have discussed, 1.1502-12, specifically provides that several items (capital gains and losses, charitable-contribution deductions, etc.) shall be accounted for on a consolidated basis, it does not similarly provide for accounting for PLEs on a consolidated basis: \"The regulations provide for blending the group members' [NOLs], and they explicitly define [CNOL] without an accompanying reference to consolidated [PLEs]. This omission ... makes clear that blending those expenses is not permitted ... .\" 208 F.3d, at 458.~    ~    ~      22~      We think the omission of PLEs from the series of items that 1.1502-12 requires to be tallied at the consolidated level has no such clear lesson, however. The logic that invests the omission with significance is familiar: the mention of some implies the exclusion of others not mentioned. Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163, 167 (1993) (\"Expressio unius est exclusio alterius\"). But here, as always, the soundness of that premise is a function of timing: if there was a good reason to consider the treatment of consolidated PLL at the time the regulation was drawn, then omitting PLL from the list of items for consolidated treatment may well have meant something. But if there was no reason to consider PLL then, its omission would mean nothing at all. And in fact there was no reason. When the consolidated return regulations were first promulgated in 1966, there was no carryback provision pegged to PLEs or PLLs; those notions did not become separate carryback items until 1978, when the 10-year rule was devised. See Revenue Act of 1978, 371, 92 Stat. 2859; see also Leatherman, Current Developments 393, n. 5. Omission of PLEs or PLLs from the series set out for consolidated treatment in the 1966 regulation therefore meant absolutely nothing in 1966. The issue, then, is the significance, not of omission, but of failure to include later: has the significance of the earlier regulation changed solely because the Treasury has never amended it, even though PLL is now a separate carryback? We think that is unlikely. The Treasury's relaxed approach to amending its regulations to track Code changes is well documented. See e.g., Dubroff 41-72, n. 193; Axelrod  Blank 1391; Leatherman, Separate Liability Losses 708-709. The absence of any amendment to 1.1502-12 that might have added PLEs or PLLs to the list of items for mandatory single-member treatment therefore is more likely a reflection of the Treasury's inattention than any affirmative intention on its part to say anything at all.~    ~    ~      23~      Last, the Government warns that \"[t]he rule that petitioner advocates would permit significant tax avoidance abuses.\" Brief for United States 40. Specifically:~    ~    ~      24~      \"Under petitioner's approach, a corporation that is currently unprofitable but that had substantial income in prior years could (i) acquire a profitable corporation with product liability expense deductions in the year of acquisition, (ii) file a consolidated return and (iii) thereby create an otherwise nonexistent 'product liability loss' for the new affiliated group that would allow the acquiring corporation to claim refunds of the tax it paid in prior years.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      25~      The Government suggests, for example, that \"a manufacturing company (with prior profits and current losses) that has no product liability exposure could purchase a tobacco company (with both prior and current profits) that has significant product liability expenses\" and that \"[t]he combined entity could ... assert a ten-year carryback of 'product liability losses' even though the tobacco company has always made a profit and never incurred a 'loss' of any type.\" Id., at 40-41, n. 27.~    ~    ~      26~      There are several answers. First, on the score of tax avoidance, the separate-member approach is no better (and is perhaps worse) than the single-entity treatment; both entail some risk of tax-motivated behavior. See Leatherman, Separate Liability Losses 681 (Under the separate-member approach, \"[d]espite sound non-tax business reasons, a group may be disinclined to form a new member or transfer assets between members, because it may worry that it would lose the benefit of a ten-year carryback,\" and \"may be encouraged to transfer assets between members to increase its consolidated [PLL], even when those transfers would otherwise be ill-advised\"). Second, the Government may, as always, address tax-motivated behavior under Internal Revenue Code 269, which gives the Secretary ample authority to \"disallow [any] deduction, credit, or other allowance\" that results from a transaction \"the principal purpose [of] which ... is evasion or avoidance of Federal income tax.\" 26 U.S.C.  269(a). And finally, if the Government were to conclude that 269 provided too little protection and that it simply could not live with the single-entity approach, the Treasury could exercise the authority provided by the Code, 26 U.S.C.  1502 and amend the consolidated return regulations.~    ~    ~      27~      * * *~    ~    ~      28~      Thus, it is true, as the Government has argued, that \"[t]he Internal Revenue Code vests ample authority in the Treasury to adopt consolidated return regulations to effect a binding resolution of the question presented in this in this case.\" Brief for United States 19-20. To the extent that the Government has exercised that authority, its actions point to the single-entity approach as the better answer. To the extent the Government disagrees, it may amend its regulations to provide for a different one.~    ~    ~      29~      The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      30~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      31~      Thomas, J., filed a concurring opinion.~    ~    ~      32~      Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         Unless otherwise noted, all statutory references are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C.  1 et seq. (1982 ed. and Supp. V), as in effect between 1983 and 1986, the tax years here in question.~      ~      ~        2~         If, for example, a company had $100 in taxable income, $50 in deductible PLEs, and $75 in additional deductions, its NOL would be $25 (i.e., $100-$50-$75= -$25); it could count only $25 of its $50 in PLEs as PLL. If the company had $100 in income, $50 in PLEs, and $125 in additional deductions, its NOL would be $75, and it could count its entire $50 in PLEs as PLL. And, finally, if the company had $100 in income, $50 in PLEs, and $40 in additional deductions, it would have positive income and, thus, no NOL and no PLL.~      ~      ~        3~         Unless otherwise noted, Treasury Regulation references are to the regulations in effect between 1983 and 1986, 26 CFR  1.1502-11 et seq.

The difference, however, does not matter. The PLL was a statutory predecessor to the SLL, and PLLs were folded into the SLL provision in 11811(b)(1) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 1388-532. Thus, \"[i]n all relevant respects, the provisions on [PLLs] and SLLs are the same.\" Leatherman, Current Developments for Consolidated Groups, 486 PLI/Tax 389, 393, n. 5 (2000) (hereinafter Leatherman, Current Developments).~      ~      ~        7~         In addition to Treas.

Reg. 1502-21(b) (2000), refer to separate group members' NOLs. The parties here have not emphasized those provisions, and with good reason. Not only are they inapplicable to the question before us (either substantively, temporally, or both), but, as one commentator has observed, their references to separate NOLs \"stem[] more from careless drafting than meaningful design.\" Leatherman, Are Separate Liability Losses Separate for Consolidated Groups?, 52 Tax. Law. 663, 705 (1999) (hereinafter Leatherman, Separate Liability Losses).~      ~      ~        8~         It makes no difference whatsoever whether the affiliate's PLEs are (1) first netted against each member's income and then aggregated or (2) first aggregated and then netted against the group's combined income: under either method, AMCA's CNOL is the same. See Axelrod  Blank 1394 (noting that this conclusion follows from \"the associative principle of arithmetic (which holds that the groupings of items in the case of addition and subtraction have no effect on the result)\").~      ~    ~    ~      33~      Justice Thomas, concurring.~    ~    ~      34~      I agree with the Court that the Internal Revenue Code provision and the corresponding Treasury Regulations that control consolidated filings are best interpreted as requiring a single-entity approach in calculating product liability loss. I write separately, however, because I respectfully disagree with the dissent's suggestion that, when a provision of the Code and the corresponding regulations are ambiguous, this Court should defer to the Government's interpretation. See post, at 1-2. At a bare minimum, in cases such as this one, in which the complex statutory and regulatory scheme lends itself to any number of interpretations, we should be inclined to rely on the traditional canon that construes revenue-raising laws against their drafter. See Leavell v. Blades, 237 Mo. 695, 700-701, 141 S. W. 893, 894 (1911) (\"When the tax gatherer puts his finger on the citizen, he must also put his finger on the law permitting it\"); United States v.

United States, 192 U.S. 38, 55 (1904).~    ~    ~      35~      Justice Stevens, dissenting.~    ~    ~      36~      This is a close and difficult case, in which neither the statute nor the regulations offer a definitive answer to the crucial textual question. Absent a clear textual anchor, I would credit the Secretary of the Treasury's concerns about the potential for abuse created by the petitioner's reading of the statutory scheme and affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals on that basis.1~    ~    ~      37~      As the majority accurately reports, during the time relevant to this case, 172(b)(1)(I) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 allowed any \"taxpayer\" who \"ha[d] a product liability loss\" to carry back its excess product liability losses for 10 years. The resolution of this case turns on whether, when a group of affiliated corporations files a consolidated tax return, the entire group should be considered the \"taxpayer\" for the purposes of implementing this provision or whether each individual corporation should be seen as a \"taxpayer.\"~    ~    ~      38~      There is no obvious answer to this question. On the one hand, it is generally accepted that the rationale behind the consolidated return regulations is to allow affiliated corporations that are run as a single entity to elect to be treated for tax purposes as a single entity. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioner 17-19 (collecting sources in which the Internal Revenue Service so stated). On the other hand, it is quite clear that each corporation in such a group remains in both a legal and a literal sense a \"taxpayer,\" a status that has important consequences. See Woolford Realty Co. v. Rose, 286 U.S. 319, 328 (1932) (\"The fact is not to be ignored that each of two or more corporations joining ... in a consolidated return is none the less a taxpayer\"); 26 U.S.C.  7701(a)(14) (defining a \"taxpayer\" as \"any person subject to any internal revenue tax,\" where a related provision defines \"person\" to include corporations). As both the group and the individual corporations are considered \"taxpayers\" in different contexts, the statute presents a genuine ambiguity.~    ~    ~      39~      When a provision of the Internal Revenue Code presents a patent ambiguity, Congress, the courts, and the IRS share a preference for resolving the ambiguity via executive action. See, e.g., National Muffler Dealers Assn., Inc. v. United States, 440 U.S. 472, 477 (1979). This is best achieved by the issuing of a Treasury Regulation resolving the ambiguity. Ibid. In this instance, however, the Secretary of the Treasury issued no such regulation. In the absence of such a regulation, the majority has scoured tangentially related regulations, looking for clues to what the Secretary might intend. For want of a more precise basis for resolving this case, that approach is sound.~    ~    ~      40~      It is at this point, however, that I part company with the majority's analysis. The fact that the regulations forward a particular method for calculating a consolidated \"net operating loss\" (NOL) for a group of affiliated companies, see Treas. Reg. 1.1502-21(f), tells us how the Secretary wants the NOL to be calculated whenever it is necessary to determine a consolidated NOL, but it does not tell us what provisions of the Code require the calculation of a consolidated NOL. That is a separate and prior question. Even if we were to draw some mild significance from the presence of such a regulation (and the absence, at the time these returns were filed, of a similar regulation for the calculation of corporation-specific NOL's), the power of that inference is counterbalanced by the fact that the regulations listing deductions that must be reported at the consolidated level makes no mention of product liability expenses. See Treas. Reg. 1.1502-12; see also H. Enterprises Int'l, Inc. v. Commisioner, 105 T. C. 71, 85 (1995) (construing Treas. Reg. 1.1502-80(a) to provide \"[w]here the consolidated return regulations do not require that corporations filing such returns be treated differently from the way separate entities would be treated, those corporations shall be treated as separate entities when applying provisions of the Code\"). In addition, the subsequent promulgation of a method for calculating a corporation-specific NOL (albeit for a different purpose), see 1.1502-79(a)(3) (defining \"separate net operating loss\"), demonstrates that there are no inherent problems implicit in undertaking such a calculation.~    ~    ~      41~      In short, I find no answer to this case in the text of the statute or in any Treasury Regulation.2 However, the government does forward a valid policy concern that militates against petitioner's construction of the statute: the fear of tax abuse. See Brief for United States 40-42. Put simply, the Government fears that currently unprofitable but previously profitable corporations might receive a substantial windfall simply by acquiring a corporation with significant product liability expenses but no product liability losses. See id., at 40. On a subjective level, I find these concerns troubling. Cf. Woolford Realty Co., 286 U.S., at 330 (rejecting \"the notion that Congress in permitting a consolidated return was willing to foster an opportunity for juggling so facile and so obvious\"). More importantly, however, I credit the Secretary of the Treasury's concerns about the potential scope of abuse. Perhaps the Court is correct in suggesting that these concerns can be alleviated through applications of other anti-abuse provisions of the Tax Code, see ante, at 15, but I am not persuaded of my own ability to make that judgment. When we deal \"with a subject that is highly specialized and so complex as to be the despair of judges,\" Dobson v. Commissioner, 320 U.S. 489, 498 (1943), an ounce of deference is appropriate.~    ~    I respectfully dissent.3~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         Justice Thomas accurately points to a tradition of cases construing \"revenue-raising laws\" against their drafter. See ante, at 1 (Thomas, J., concurring). However, when the ambiguous provision in question is not one that imposes tax liability but rather one that crafts an exception from a general revenue duty for the benefit of some taxpayers, a countervailing tradition suggests that the ambiguity should be resolved in the government's favor. See, e.g., INDOPCO, Inc. v. Commissioner, 503 U.S. 79, 84 (1992); Interstate Transit Lines v. Commissioner, 319 U.S. 590, 593 (1943); Deputy v. Du Pont, 308 U.S. 488, 493 (1940); New Colonial Ice Co. v. Helvering, 292 U.S. 435, 440 (1934); Woolford Realty Co. v. Rose, 286 U.S. 319, 326 (1932).~      ~      ~        2~         I am also in full agreement with the Court's rejection of the Government's double-deduction argument. See ante, at 11-12.~      ~      ~        3~         Because I agree with the majority that the calculation contemplated by Treas. Reg. 1.1502-79(a)(3) better approximates the NOL that each company would have had reported if filing individually than the alternative forwarded by the Government, see ante, at 10, I agree with the Court of Appeals' decision to adopt that measure and would affirm the decision below in its entirety.~      ~    ~    ",

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.SHARON B. POLLARD, PETITIONERv.E. I. du PONT de NEMOURS  COMPANY\r~    No. 00-763.\r~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\r~    Argued April 23, 2001Decided June 4, 2001\r~    \r~      Syllabus\r~      Petitioner Pollard sued respondent, her former employer, alleging that she had been subjected to a hostile work environment based on her sex, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Finding that Pollard was subjected to co-worker sexual harassment of which her supervisors were aware, and that the harassment resulted in a medical leave of absence for psychological assistance and her eventual dismissal for refusing to return to the same hostile work environment, the District Court awarded her, as relevant here, $300,000 in compensatory damages-the maximum permitted under 42 U.S.C.  1981a(b)(3). The court observed that the award was insufficient to compensate Pollard, but was bound by an earlier Sixth Circuit holding that front pay-money awarded for lost compensation during the period between judgment and reinstatement or in lieu of reinstatement-was subject to the damages cap of 1981a(b)(3). The Sixth Circuit affirmed.\r~      Held: Front pay is not an element of compensatory damages under 1981a and thus is not subject to the damages cap imposed by 1981a(b)(3). Pp. 3-10.\r~      (a) Under 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as originally enacted, when a court found that an employer had intentionally engaged in an unlawful employment practice, the court was authorized to award such remedies as injunctions, reinstatement, backpay, and lost benefits. 42 U.S.C.  2000e-5(g)(1). Because this provision closely tracked the language of 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 10(c)'s meaning before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was enacted provides guidance as to 706(g)'s proper meaning. In applying 10(c), the National Labor Relations Board consistently had made \"backpay\" awards up to the date the employee was reinstated or returned to the position he should have been in had the NLRA violation not occurred, even if such event occurred after judgment. Consistent with that interpretation, courts finding unlawful intentional discrimination in Title VII actions awarded this same type of backpay (known today as \"front pay\" when it occurs after the judgment) under 706(g). After Congress expanded 706(g)'s remedies in 1972 to include \"any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate,\" courts endorsed a broad view of front pay, which included front pay awards made in lieu of reinstatement. By 1991, virtually all of the courts of appeals had recognized front pay as a remedy authorized by 706(g). In 1991, Congress further expanded the available remedies to include compensatory and punitive damages, subject to 1981a(b)(3)'s cap. Pp. 3-7.\r~      (b) The 1991 Act's plain language makes clear that the newly authorized 1981a remedies were in addition to the relief authorized by 706(g). Thus, if front pay was a type of relief authorized under 706(g), it is excluded from the meaning of compensatory damages under 1981a and it would not be subject to 1981a(b)(3)'s cap. As the original language of 706(g) authorizing backpay awards was modeled after the same language in the NLRA, backpay awards (now called front pay awards under Title VII) made for the period between the judgment date and the reinstatement date were authorized under 706(g). Because there is no logical difference between front pay awards made when there eventually is reinstatement and those made when there is not, front pay awards made in lieu of reinstatement are authorized under 706(g) as well. To distinguish between the two cases would lead to the strange result that employees could receive front pay when reinstatement eventually is available but not when it is unavailable-whether because of continuing hostility between the plaintiff and the employer or its workers, or because of psychological injuries that the discrimination has caused the plaintiff. Thus, the most egregious offenders could be subject to the least sanctions. The text of 706(g) does not lend itself to such a distinction. Front pay awards made in lieu of reinstatement fit within 706(g)'s authorization for courts to \"order such affirmative action as may be appropriate.\" Pp. 8-10. 213 F.3d 933, reversed and remanded.\r~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\r~      Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other Members joined, except O'Connor, J., who took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.\r~      Opinion of the Court\r~      Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.\r~    \r~    \r~      1\r~      This case presents the question whether a front pay award is an element of compensatory damages under the Civil Rights Act of 1991. We conclude that it is not.\r~    \r~    \r~      2\r~      * Petitioner Sharon Pollard sued her former employer, E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DuPont), alleging that she had been subjected to a hostile work environment based on her sex, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, 42 U.S.C.  2000e et seq. After a trial, the District Court found that Pollard was subjected to co-worker sexual harassment of which her supervisors were aware. The District Court further found that the harassment resulted in a medical leave of absence from her job for psychological assistance and her eventual dismissal for refusing to return to the same hostile work environment. The court awarded Pollard $107,364 in backpay and benefits, $252,997 in attorney's fees, and, as relevant here, $300,000 in compensatory damages-the maximum permitted under the statutory cap for such damages in 42 U.S.C.  1981a(b)(3). The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that the record demonstrated that DuPont employees engaged in flagrant discrimination based on sex and that DuPont managers and supervisors did not take adequate steps to stop it. 213 F.3d 933 (CA6 2000).\r~    \r~    \r~      3\r~      The issue presented for review here is whether front pay constitutes an element of \"compensatory damages\" under 42 U.S.C.  1981a and thus is subject to the statutory damages cap imposed by that section. Although courts have defined \"front pay\" in numerous ways, front pay is simply money awarded for lost compensation during the period between judgment and reinstatement or in lieu of reinstatement. For instance, when an appropriate position for the plaintiff is not immediately available without displacing an incumbent employee, courts have ordered reinstatement upon the opening of such a position and have ordered front pay to be paid until reinstatement occurs. See, e.g., Walsdorf v. Board of Comm'rs, 857 F.2d 1047, 1053-1054 (CA5 1988); King v. Staley, 849 F.2d 1143, 1145 (CA8 1988). In cases in which reinstatement is not viable because of continuing hostility between the plaintiff and the employer or its workers, or because of psychological injuries suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the discrimination, courts have ordered front pay as a substitute for reinstatement. See, e.g., Gotthardt v. National R. R. Passenger Corp., 191 F.3d 1148, 1156 (CA9 1999); Fitzgerald v. Sirloin Stockade, Inc., 624 F.2d 945, 957 (CA10 1980). For the purposes of this opinion, it is not necessary for us to explain when front pay is an appropriate remedy. The question before us is only whether front pay, if found to be appropriate, is an element of compensatory damages under the Civil Rights Act of 1991 and thus subject to the Act's statutory cap on such damages.\r~    \r~    \r~      4\r~      Here, the District Court observed that \"the $300,000.00 award is, in fact, insufficient to compensate plaintiff,\" 16 F. Supp. 2d 913, 924, n. 19 (WD Tenn. 1998), but it stated that it was bound by the Sixth Circuit's decision in Hudson v. Reno, 130 F.3d 1193 (1997), which held that front pay was subject to the cap. On appeal, Pollard argued that Hudson was wrongly decided because front pay is not an element of compensatory damages, but rather a replacement for the remedy of reinstatement in situations in which reinstatement would be inappropriate. She also argued that 1981a, by its very terms, explicitly excludes from the statutory cap remedies that traditionally were available under Title VII, which she argued included front pay. The Court of Appeals agreed with Pollard's arguments but considered itself bound by Hudson. The Sixth Circuit declined to rehear the case en banc.\r~    \r~    \r~      5\r~      The Sixth Circuit's decision in Hudson was one of the first appellate opinions to decide whether front pay is an element of compensatory damages subject to the statutory cap set forth in 1981a(b)(3). Contrary to the Sixth Circuit's resolution of this question, the other Courts of Appeals to address it have concluded that front pay is a remedy that is not subject to the limitations of 1981a(b)(3). See, e.g., Pals v. Schepel Buick  GMC Truck, Inc., 220 F.3d 495, 499-500 (CA7 2000); Kramer v. Logan County School Dist. No. R-1, 157 F.3d 620, 625-626 (CA8 1998); Gotthardt, supra, at 1153-1154; Medlock v. Ortho Biotech, Inc., 164 F.3d 545, 556 (CA10 1999); EEOC v. WO, Inc., 213 F.3d 600, 619, n. 10 (CA11 2000); Martini v. Federal Nat. Mortgage Assn., 178 F.3d 1336, 1348-1349 (CADC 1999). We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict. 531 U.S. 1069 (2001).\r~    \r~    II\r~    \r~      6\r~      Plaintiffs who allege employment discrimination on the basis of sex traditionally have been entitled to such remedies as injunctions, reinstatement, backpay, lost benefits, and attorney's fees under 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 42 U.S.C.  2000e-5(g)(1). In the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Congress expanded the remedies available to these plaintiffs by permitting, for the first time, the recovery of compensatory and punitive damages. 42 U.S.C.  1981a(a)(1) (\"[T]he complaining party may recover compensatory and punitive damages as allowed in subsection (b) of this section, in addition to any relief authorized by section 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\"). The amount of compensatory damages awarded under 1981a for \"future pecuniary losses, emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and other nonpecuniary losses,\" and the amount of punitive damages awarded under 1981a, however, may not exceed the statutory cap set forth in 1981a(b)(3). The statutory cap is based on the number of people employed by the respondent. In this case, the cap is $300,000 because DuPont has more than 500 employees.\r~    \r~    \r~      7\r~      The Sixth Circuit has concluded that front pay constitutes compensatory damages awarded for future pecuniary losses and thus is subject to the statutory cap of 1981a(b)(3). 213 F.3d, at 945; Hudson, supra, at 1203. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that front pay is not an element of compensatory damages within the meaning of 1981a, and, therefore, we hold that the statutory cap of 1981a(b)(3) is inapplicable to front pay.\r~    \r~    \r~      8\r~      * Under 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as originally enacted, when a court found that an employer had intentionally engaged in an unlawful employment practice, the court was authorized to \"enjoin the respondent from engaging in such unlawful employment practice, and order such affirmative action as may be appropriate, which may include, but is not limited to, reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without back pay.\" 42 U.S.C.  2000e-5(g)(1). This provision closely tracked the language of 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 49 Stat. 454, 29 U.S.C.  160(c), which similarly authorized orders requiring employers to take appropriate, remedial \"affirmative action.\" 160(c) (authorizing the National Labor Relations Board to issue an order \"requiring such person to cease and desist from such unfair labor practice, and to take such affirmative action including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of this subchapter\"). See also Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 419, n. 11 (1975). The meaning of this provision of the NLRA prior to enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, therefore, gives us guidance as to the proper meaning of the same language in 706(g) of Title VII. In applying 10(c) of the NLRA, the Board consistently had made awards of what it called \"backpay\" up to the date the employee was reinstated or returned to the position he should have been in had the violation of the NLRA not occurred, even if such event occurred after judgment. See, e.g., Nathanson v. NLRB, 344 U.S. 25, 29-30 (1952); NLRB v. Reeves Broadcasting  Development Corp., 336 F.2d 590, 593-594 (CA4 1964); NLRB v. Hill  Hill Truck Line, Inc., 266 F.2d 883, 887 (CA5 1959); Berger Polishing, Inc., 147 N. L. R. B. 21, 40 (1964); Lock Joint Pipe Co., 141 N. L. R. B. 943, 948 (1963). Consistent with the Board's interpretation of this provision of the NLRA, courts finding unlawful intentional discrimination in Title VII actions awarded this same type of backpay under 706(g). See, e.g., Culpepper v. Reynolds Metals Co., 442 F.2d 1078, 1080 (CA5 1971); United States v. Georgia Power Co., 3 FEP Cases 767, 790 (ND Ga. 1971). In the Title VII context, this form of \"backpay\" occurring after the date of judgment is known today as \"front pay.\"\r~    \r~    \r~      9\r~      In 1972, Congress expanded 706(g) to specify that a court could, in addition to awarding those remedies previously listed in the provision, award \"any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.\" After this amendment to 706(g), courts endorsed a broad view of front pay. See, e.g., Patterson v. American Tobacco Co., 535 F.2d 257, 269 (CA4 1976) (stating that where reinstatement is not immediately feasible, backpay \"should be supplemented by an award equal to the estimated present value of lost earnings that are reasonably likely to occur between the date of judgment and the time when the employee can assume his new position\"); EEOC v. Enterprise Assn. Steamfitters, 542 F.2d 579, 590 (CA2 1976) (stating that backpay award would terminate on the date of actual remedying of discrimination); Bush v. Lone Star Steel Co., 373 F. Supp. 526, 538 (ED Tex. 1974) (ordering backpay from the date the employee would have been entitled to fill a vacancy but for racial discrimination to the date the employee would in all reasonable probability reach his rightful place). Courts recognized that reinstatement was not always a viable option, and that an award of front pay as a substitute for reinstatement in such cases was a necessary part of the \"make whole\" relief mandated by Congress and by this Court in Albemarle. See, e.g., Shore v. Federal Express Corp., 777 F.2d 1155, 1158-1159 (CA6 1985) (\"Front pay is ... simply compensation for the post-judgment effects of past discrimination.\" It is awarded \"to effectuate fully the 'make whole' purposes of Title VII\"); Brooks v. Woodline Motor Freight, Inc., 852 F.2d 1061, 1066 (CA8 1988) (stating that front pay was appropriate given substantial animosity between parties where \"the parties' relationship was not likely to improve, and the nature of the business required a high degree of mutual trust and confidence\"); Fitzgerald v. Sirloin Stockade, Inc., 624 F.2d 945, 957 (CA10 1980) (upholding award of front pay where continuing hostility existed between the parties); Cassino v. Reichhold Chems., Inc., 817 F.2d 1338, 1347 (CA9 1987) (same). By 1991, virtually all of the courts of appeals had recognized that \"front pay\" was a remedy authorized under 706(g).1 In fact, no court of appeals appears to have ever held to the contrary.2\r~    \r~    \r~      10\r~      In 1991, without amending 706(g), Congress further expanded the remedies available in cases of intentional employment discrimination to include compensatory and punitive damages. See 42 U.S.C.  1981a(a)(1). At that time, Rev. Stat. 1977, 42 U.S.C.  1981 permitted the recovery of unlimited compensatory and punitive damages in cases of intentional race and ethnic discrimination, but no similar remedy existed in cases of intentional sex, religious, or disability discrimination. Thus, 1981a brought all forms of intentional employment discrimination into alignment, at least with respect to the forms of relief available to successful plaintiffs. However, compensatory and punitive damages awarded under 1981a may not exceed the statutory limitations set forth in 1981a(b)(3), while such damages awarded under 1981 are not limited by statute.\r~    \r~    B\r~    \r~      11\r~      In the abstract, front pay could be considered compensation for \"future pecuniary losses,\" in which case it would be subject to the statutory cap. 1981a(b)(3). The term \"compensatory damages ... for future pecuniary losses\" is not defined in the statute, and, out of context, its ordinary meaning could include all payments for monetary losses after the date of judgment. However, we must not analyze one term of 1981a in isolation. See Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Assn., 505 U.S. 88, 99 (1992) (\" '[W]e must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law' \"). When 1981a is read as a whole, the better interpretation is that front pay is not within the meaning of compensatory damages in 1981a(b)(3), and thus front pay is excluded from the statutory cap.\r~    \r~    \r~      12\r~      In the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Congress determined that victims of employment discrimination were entitled to additional remedies. Congress expressly found that \"additional remedies under Federal law are needed to deter unlawful harassment and intentional discrimination in the workplace,\" without giving any indication that it wished to curtail previously available remedies. See Civil Rights Act of 1991, 105 Stat. 1071, 2. Congress therefore made clear through the plain language of the statute that the remedies newly authorized under 1981a were in addition to the relief authorized by 706(g). Section 1981a(a)(1) provides that, in intentional discrimination cases brought under Title VII, \"the complaining party may recover compensatory and punitive damages as allowed in subjection (b) of [1981a], in addition to any relief authorized by section 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, from the respondent.\" (Emphasis added.) And 1981a(b)(2) states that \"[c]ompensatory damages awarded under [1981a] shall not include backpay, interest on backpay, or any other type of relief authorized under section 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\" (Emphasis added.) According to these statutory provisions, if front pay was a type of relief authorized under 706(g), it is excluded from the meaning of compensatory damages under 1981a.\r~    \r~    \r~      13\r~      As discussed above, the original language of 706(g) authorizing backpay awards was modeled after the same language in the NLRA. This provision in the NLRA had been construed to allow awards of backpay up to the date of reinstatement, even if reinstatement occurred after judgment. Accordingly, backpay awards made for the period between the date of judgment and the date of reinstatement, which today are called front pay awards under Title VII, were authorized under 706(g).\r~    \r~    \r~      14\r~      As to front pay awards that are made in lieu of reinstatement, we construe 706(g) as authorizing these awards as well. We see no logical difference between front pay awards made when there eventually is reinstatement and those made when there is not.3 Moreover, to distinguish between the two cases would lead to the strange result that employees could receive front pay when reinstatement eventually is available but not when reinstatement is not an option-whether because of continuing hostility between the plaintiff and the employer or its workers, or because of psychological injuries that the discrimination has caused the plaintiff. Thus, the most egregious offenders could be subject to the least sanctions. Had Congress drawn such a line in the statute and foreclosed front pay awards in lieu of reinstatement, we certainly would honor that line. But, as written, the text of the statute does not lend itself to such a distinction, and we will not create one. The statute authorizes courts to \"order such affirmative action as may be appropriate.\" 42 U.S.C.  2000e-5(g)(1). We conclude that front pay awards in lieu of reinstatement fit within this statutory term.\r~    \r~    \r~      15\r~      Because front pay is a remedy authorized under 706(g), Congress did not limit the availability of such awards in 1981a. Instead, Congress sought to expand the available remedies by permitting the recovery of compensatory and punitive damages in addition to previously available remedies, such as front pay.\r~    \r~    \r~      16\r~      * * *\r~    \r~    \r~      17\r~      The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r~    \r~    \r~      18\r~      It is so ordered.\r~    \r~    \r~      19\r~      Justice O'Connor took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\r~    \r~    \r~      \r~        NOTES:\r~      \r~      \r~        1\r~         See, e.g., Barbano v.

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.STATE OF KANSAS, PLAINTIFFv.STATE OF COLORADO~    No. 105, Orig.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued March 19, 2001Decided June 11, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      The Arkansas River rises in Colorado and flows through Kansas and several other States before emptying into the Mississippi River. In 1949, Congress approved the Arkansas River Compact (Compact), which Colorado and Kansas negotiated, and which provided in Article IV-D that, inter alia, future development of the river basin could not materially deplete the usable quantity or availability to other users of the river's waters. In 1986, Kansas filed a complaint alleging that Colorado had violated the Compact. In his first report, the Special Master found that post-Compact increases in groundwater well pumping in Colorado had materially depleted the waters in violation of Article IV-D; in his second report, he recommended that damages be awarded to Kansas; and in his third report, he recommended that such damages be measured by Kansas' losses attributable to Compact violations since 1950, be paid in money not water, and include prejudgment interest from 1969 to the date of judgment. Colorado has filed four objections to the third report, Kansas has filed one, and the United States submits that all objections should be overruled.~      Held:   1. The recommended damages award does not violate the Eleventh Amendment. Thus, Colorado's first exception is overruled. Colorado contends that that the Amendment precludes damages based on losses sustained by individual Kansas farmers, as the Report recommends. Kansas has unquestionably made the required showing that it has a direct interest of its own and is not merely seeking recovery for the benefit of individuals who are the real parties in interest. Oklahoma ex rel. Johnson v. Cook, 304 U.S. 387, 396. This is but one of several proceedings in which Kansas' own interest in preventing upstream diversion of the river has justified the exercise of this Court's original jurisdiction. Kansas has been in full control of this litigation since its inception, and its right to control the disposition of any recovery of damages is unencumbered. The injury to individual farmers is but one component of the formula adopted by the Special Master to quantify damages here. When a State properly invokes this Court's original jurisdiction, neither the measure of, nor the method for calculating, damages can retrospectively negate that jurisdiction. Nor would jurisdiction be affected by Kansas' postjudgment decision about whether to deposit the money recovered in its general coffers or use the money to benefit those who were hurt by the violation. Pp. 3-6.~      2. The unliquidated nature of Kansas' money damages does not bar an award of prejudgment interest. Thus, Colorado's second exception is overruled. This Court has long recognized that the common-law distinction between liquidated and unliquidated damages is unsound, Funkhouser v. J. B. Preston Co., 290 U.S. 163, 168, and that a monetary award does not fully compensate for an injury unless it includes an interest component, see, e.g., Milwaukee v. Cement Div., National Gypsum Co., 515 U.S. 189, 195. The Special Master acted properly in declining to follow this long-repudiated common-law rule. Pp. 6-9.~      3. The Special Master determined the appropriate rate for the prejudgment interest award and determined that interest should begin running in 1969. Colorado's third exception is overruled insofar as it challenges the interest rates and sustained insofar as it challenges the Special Master's recommendation that the interest should begin to accrue in 1969. Kansas' exception that the interest should begin to accrue in 1950 is overruled. Pp. 9-14.~      (a) Because this Court has decided that Kansas could measure a portion of its damages by individual farmers' losses, the interest rates applicable to individuals in the relevant years, rather than the lower rates available to States, may properly be used to calculate damages. Pp. 9-10.~      (b) The Special Master concluded that interest should be awarded according to fairness considerations rather than a rigid theory of compensation for money withheld. Kansas' argument that this Court has effectively foreclosed that equities-balancing approach has some merit, but this Court cannot say that by 1949 the Court's case law had developed sufficiently to put Colorado on notice that prejudgment interest would automatically be awarded from the time of injury for a Compact violation. Therefore, the Special Master acted properly in analyzing this case's facts and awarding only as much prejudgment interest as was required by balancing the equities. The equities support an award beginning on a date later than the date of first violation. The factors the Special Master considered-that no one thought that the pact was being violated in the early years after it was signed and that a long interval passed between the original injuries and these proceedings, as well as the dramatic impact of compounding interest over many years-fully justify his view that prejudgment interest should not be awarded for any years before either party was aware of the excessive pumping. Colorado suggests that prejudgment interest should begin to accrue in 1985, the year the complaint was filed, rather than 1969, when Colorado knew or should have known that it was violating the Compact. Though the issue is close, the equities favor the later date. In overruling Colorado's exceptions to the second report, this Court held that Kansas was not guilty of inexcusable delay in failing to complain more promptly about the post-Compact pumping because the nature and extent of the violations were unclear even years after the violation became obvious. That conclusion is a double-edged sword. Both States' interests would have been served had the claim been advanced promptly after its basis became known, and it was clear that once the proceedings started they would be complex and protracted. Given the uncertainty over the damages' scope that prevailed from 1968 and 1985 and the fact Kansas had the power to begin the process by which those damages would be quantified, Colorado's request that the Court deny prejudgment interest for that time is reasonable. Pp. 10-13.~      4. The Special Master properly determined the value of the crop losses attributable to Compact violations. Thus, Colorado's fourth exception is overruled. Kansas and Colorado disagreed as to how much additional crop yield would have been produced with the missing water. Kansas' experts relied upon the hypothesis of a generally linear relationship between water available for use and increased crop yields. Colorado, whose own expert recanted an alternative proposal for calculating damages, attempts to poke holes in Kansas' methodology through a speculative application of economic theory. That attack is unpersuasive, given Colorado's inability to mount an effective challenge to Kansas' experts on their own terms and its complete failure to provide a plausible alternative estimate of crop damage. Pp. 14-17.~      Colorado's exceptions sustained in part and overruled in part; Kansas' exception overruled; and case remanded.~      ON EXCEPTIONS TO REPORT OF SPECIAL MASTER~      Stevens, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, Parts I, IV, and V of which were unanimous, and Parts II and III of which were joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and Kennedy, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      The Arkansas River rises in the mountains of Colorado just east of the Continental Divide, descends for about 280 miles to the Kansas border, then flows through that State, Oklahoma, and Arkansas and empties into the Mississippi River. On May 20, 1901, Kansas first invoked this Court's original jurisdiction to seek a remedy for Colorado's diversion of water from the Arkansas River. See Kansas v. Colorado, 185 U.S. 125, 126 (1902) (statement of case). In opinions written during the past century, most recently in Kansas v. Colorado, 514 U.S. 673, 675-678 (1995), we have described the history and the importance of the river. For present purposes it suffices to note that two of those cases, Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U.S. 46 (1907), and Colorado v. Kansas, 320 U.S. 383 (1943), led to the negotiation of the Arkansas River Compact (Compact), an agreement between Kansas and Colorado that in turn was approved by Congress in 1949. See 63 Stat. 145. The case before us today involves a claim by Kansas for damages based on Colorado's violations of that Compact.~    ~    ~      2~      The Compact was designed to \"[s]ettle existing disputes and remove causes of future controversy\" between the two States and their citizens concerning waters of the Arkansas River and to \"[e]quitably divide and apportion\" those waters and the benefits arising from construction and operation of the federal project known as the \"John Martin Reservoir.\" Arkansas River Compact, Art. I, reprinted in App. to Brief for Kansas A-1, A-2. Article IV-D of the Compact provides:~    ~    ~      3~      \"This Compact is not intended to impede or prevent future beneficial development of the Arkansas River basin in Colorado and Kansas by Federal or State agencies, by private enterprise, or by combinations thereof, which may involve construction of dams, reservoir, and other works for the purpose of water utilization and control, as well as the improved or prolonged functioning of existing works: Provided, that the waters of the Arkansas River, as defined in Article III, shall not be materially depleted in usable quantity or availability for use to the water users in Colorado and Kansas under this Compact by such future development or construction.\" Id., at A-5. It is the proviso to that paragraph that is of special relevance to this case.~    ~    ~      4~      In 1986, we granted Kansas leave to file a complaint alleging three violations of the Compact by Colorado. See 514 U.S., at 679-680. After taking evidence in the liability phase of the proceeding, Special Master Arthur L. Littleworth filed his first report, in which he recommended that two of the claims be denied, but that the Court find that post-Compact increases in groundwater well pumping in Colorado had materially depleted the waters of the river in violation of Article IV-D. See id., at 680. We overruled Colorado's exceptions to that recommendation, including an argument that Kansas was guilty of laches. Id., at 687-689. We remanded the case to the Special Master to determine an appropriate remedy for the violations of Article IV-D. Id., at 694.~    ~    ~      5~      After further proceedings the Special Master filed a second report recommending an award of damages. Colorado filed Exceptions to that report, arguing that the Eleventh Amendment barred an award based on losses incurred by Kansas citizens, and that the report improperly recommended the recovery of prejudgment interest on an unliquidated claim. We overruled those exceptions without prejudice to their renewal after the Special Master made a more specific recommendation for a remedy. 522 U.S. 1073 (1998). He did so in his third report, and we are now confronted with exceptions filed by both States.~    ~    ~      6~      In the third report, the Special Master recommends that damages be measured by Kansas' losses, rather than Colorado's profits, attributable to Compact violations after 1950; that the damages be paid in money rather than water; and that the damages should include prejudgment interest from 1969 to the date of judgment. Colorado has filed four objections to the report. It contends (1) that the recommended award of damages would violate the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution; (2) that the damages award should not include prejudgment interest; (3) that the amount of interest awarded is excessive; and (4) that the Special Master improperly credited flawed expert testimony, with the result that Kansas' crop production losses were improperly calculated. On the other hand, Kansas has filed an objection submitting that prejudgment interest should be paid from 1950, rather than 1969. The United States, which intervened because of its interest in the operation of flood control projects in Colorado, submits that both States' objections should be overruled.~    ~    ~      7~      * We have decided that a State may recover monetary damages from another State in an original action, without running afoul of the Eleventh Amendment.1 See, e.g., Texas v. New Mexico, 482 U.S. 124, 130 (1987) (\"The Court has recognized the propriety of money judgments against a State in an original action, and specifically in a case involving a compact. In proper original actions, the Eleventh Amendment is no barrier, for by its terms, it applies only to suits by citizens against a State\" (citations omitted)); see also Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U.S. 725, 745, n. 21 (1981); South Dakota v. North Carolina, 192 U.S. 286, 317-321 (1904). Colorado contends, however, that the Eleventh Amendment precludes any such recovery based on losses sustained by individual water users in Kansas.~    ~    ~      8~      It is firmly established, and undisputed in this litigation, that the text of the Eleventh Amendment would bar a direct action against Colorado by citizens of Kansas. Moreover, we have several times held that a State may not invoke our original jurisdiction when it is merely acting as an agent or trustee for one or more of its citizens. For example, in New Hampshire v. Louisiana, 108 U.S. 76 (1883), we refused to assume jurisdiction over an action to recover payment on defaulted bonds that had been formally assigned to the state plaintiffs but remained beneficially owned by private individuals. And, in North Dakota v. Minnesota, 263 U.S. 365 (1923), we held that, while the plaintiff State could obtain an injunction against the improper operation of Minnesota's drainage ditches, the Eleventh Amendment precluded an award of damages based on injuries to individual farmers, where the damages claim was financed by contributions from the farmers and the State had committed to dividing any recovery among the farmers \"in proportion to the amount of [their] loss.\" Id., at 375.~    ~    ~      9~      Those cases make it clear that a \"State is not permitted to enter a controversy as a nominal party in order to forward the claims of individual citizens.\" Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U.S., at 737; see also New Hampshire v. Louisiana, 108 U.S., at 89 (Eleventh Amendment applies and acts to bar jurisdiction where \"the State and the attorney-general are only nominal actors in the proceeding\"). The \"governing principle\" is that in order to invoke our original jurisdiction, \"the State must show a direct interest of its own and not merely seek recovery for the benefit of individuals who are the real parties in interest.\" Oklahoma ex rel. Johnson v. Cook, 304 U.S. 387, 396 (1938).~    ~    ~      10~      Kansas has unquestionably made such a showing. Indeed, the present proceeding is but one of several in which Kansas' own interest in preventing upstream diversions from the Arkansas River has justified an exercise of our original jurisdiction. In Cook we even offered as an example of proper original jurisdiction one of the prior original suits between Kansas and Colorado, see id., at 393-394 (citing Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U.S. 46 (1907)), and in Texas v. New Mexico we held that enforcement of an interstate water compact by means of a recovery of money damages can be within a State's proper pursuit of the \"general public interest\" in an original action, 482 U.S., at 132, n. 7.~    ~    ~      11~      Moreover, the record in this case plainly discloses that the State of Kansas has been in full control of this litigation since its inception. Its right to control the disposition of any recovery of damages is entirely unencumbered. The injury to individual farmers is but one component of the formula adopted by the Special Master to quantify the damages caused by Colorado's violation of its contractual obligations. In short, there is simply nothing in the record to suggest that the State of Kansas is merely a \"nominal party\" to this litigation or that the individual farmers are \"the real parties in interest.\"~    ~    ~      12~      When a State properly invokes our jurisdiction to seek redress for a wrong perpetrated against it by a sister State, neither the measure of damages that we ultimately determine to be proper nor our method for calculating those damages can retrospectively negate our jurisdiction. Nor would our jurisdiction to order a damages remedy be affected by Kansas' postjudgment decisions concerning the use of the money recovered from Colorado. As we have previously recognized, it is the State's prerogative either to deposit the proceeds of any judgment in \"the general coffers of the State\" or to use them to \"benefit those who were hurt.\" Texas v. New Mexico, 482 U.S., at 132, n. 7.~    ~    ~      13~      We overrule Colorado's first exception.~    ~    II~    ~      14~      Colorado next excepts to the Special Master's conclusion that the damages award should include prejudgment interest despite the fact that Kansas' claim is unliquidated.2 At one point in time, the fact that the claim was unliquidated would have been of substantial importance. As a general matter, early common-law cases drew a distinction between liquidated and unliquidated claims and refused to allow interest on the latter. See, e.g., Comment, Rothschild, Prejudgment Interest: Survey and Suggestion, 77 Nw. U. L. Rev. 192, 196, and n. 26 (1982) (discussing history and collecting sources). This rule seems to have rested upon a belief that there was something inherently unfair about requiring debtors to pay interest when they were unable to halt its accrual by handing over to their creditors a fixed and unassailable amount. See, e.g., id., at 196.~    ~    ~      15~      This common-law distinction has long since lost its hold on the legal imagination. Beginning in the early part of the last century, numerous courts and commentators have rejected the distinction for failing to acknowledge the compensatory nature of interest awards.3 This Court allied itself with the evolving consensus in 1933, when we expressed the opinion that the distinction between cases of liquidated and unliquidated damages \"is not a sound one.\" Funkhouser v. J. B. Preston Co., 290 U.S. 163, 168 (1933). The analysis supporting that conclusion gave no doubt as to our reasoning: \"Whether the case is of the one class or the other, the injured party has suffered a loss which may be regarded as not fully compensated if he is confined to the amount found to be recoverable as of the time of breach and nothing is added for the delay in obtaining the award of damages.\" Ibid. Our cases since 1933 have consistently acknowledged that a monetary award does not fully compensate for an injury unless it includes an interest component. See, e.g., Milwaukee v. Cement Div., National Gypsum Co., 515 U.S. 189, 195 (1995) (\"The essential rationale for awarding prejudgment interest is to ensure that an injured party is fully compensated for its loss\"); West Virginia v. United States, 479 U.S. 305, 310-311, n. 2 (1987); General Motors Corp. v. Devex Corp., 461 U.S. 648, 655, n. 10 (1983).~    ~    ~      16~      Relying on our cases, the Special Master \"concluded that the unliquidated nature of Kansas' money damages does not, in and of itself, bar an award of prejudgment interest.\" Second Report, XV, reprinted in App. to Third Report 43. In reaching that conclusion, the Special Master was fully cognizant of both the displaced common-law rule and the subsequent doctrinal evolution. In addition, he gave careful consideration to equitable considerations that might mitigate against an award of interest, concluding that \"considerations of fairness,\" Board of Comm'rs of Jackson Cty. v. United States, 308 U.S. 343, 352 (1939), supported the award of at least some prejudgment interest in this case.~    ~    ~      17~      We find no fault in the Special Master's analysis of either our prior cases or the equities of this matter. While we will deal with the amount of prejudgment interest below, to answer Colorado's second objection it is sufficient to conclude that the Special Master was correct in determining that the unliquidated nature of the damages does not preclude an award of prejudgment interest.4~    ~    ~      18~      Colorado's second exception is overruled.~    ~    III~    ~      19~      Colorado's third exception takes issue with both the rate of interest adopted by the Special Master and the date from which he recommended that interest begin to accrue. As to the second of these two concerns, Colorado submits that, if any prejudgment interest is to be awarded, it should begin to accrue in 1985 (when Kansas filed its complaint in this action), rather than in 1969 (when, the Special Master concluded, Colorado knew or should have known that it was violating the Compact). On the other hand, Kansas has entered an exception, arguing that the accrual of interest should begin in 1950. We first address the rate question, then the timing issue.~    ~    ~      20~      * The Special Master credited the testimony of Kansas' three experts who calculated the interest rates that they thought necessary to provide full compensation for the damages caused by Colorado's violations of the Compact in the years since 1950. As a result of inflation and changing market conditions those rates varied from year to year. In their calculation of the damages suffered by Kansas farmers, the experts used the interest rates that were applicable to individuals in the relevant years rather than the (lower) rates available to States.~    ~    ~      21~      Colorado argues that the lower rates should have been used because it is the State, rather than the individual farmers, that is maintaining the action and will receive any award of damages. But if, as we have already decided, see Part I, supra, it is permissible for the State to measure a portion of its damages by losses suffered by individual farmers, it necessarily follows that the courts are free to utilize whatever interest rate will most accurately measure those losses. The money in question in this portion of the damages award is revenue that would-but for Colorado's actions-have been earned by individual farmers. Thus, the Special Master correctly concluded that the economic consequences of Colorado's breach could best be remedied by an interest award that mirrors the cost of any additional borrowing the farmers may have been forced to undertake in order to compensate for lost revenue.~    ~    B~    ~      22~      Although the Special Master rejected Colorado's submission that there is a categorical bar to the award of prejudgment interest on unliquidated claims, he concluded that such interest should not \" 'be awarded according to any rigid theory of compensation for money withheld,' \" but rather should respond to \" 'considerations of fairness.' \" Third Report 97 (quoting Jackson Cty., 308 U.S., at 352). Kansas argues that our decisions subsequent to Jackson County have effectively foreclosed the equitiesnbhyph;balancing approach that the Special Master adopted. There is some merit to Kansas' position. See National Gypsum Co., 515 U.S., at 193 (affirming a decision of the Court of Appeals that had read our cases as \"disapproving of a 'balancing of the equities' as a method of deciding whether to allow prejudgment interest\").~    ~    ~      23~      However, despite the clear direction indicated by some of our earlier opinions, we cannot say that by 1949 our caselaw had developed sufficiently to put Colorado on notice that, upon a violation of the Compact, we would automatically award prejudgment interest from the time of injury. Given the state of the law at that time, Colorado may well have believed that we would balance the equities in order to achieve a just and equitable remedy, rather than automatically imposing prejudgment interest in order to achieve full compensation. See Jackson Cty., 308 U.S., at 352 (prejudgment interest award limited by \"considerations of fairness\"); Miller v. Robertson, 266 U.S. 243, 258 (1924) (\"[W]hen necessary in order to arrive at fair compensation, the court in the exercise of a sound discretion may include interest or its equivalent as an element of damages\" on unliquidated claims); Restatement of Contracts 337, p. 542 (1932) (prejudgment interest on unliquidated claims \"may be allowed in the discretion of the court, if justice requires it\"). While we are confident that, when it signed the Compact, Colorado was on notice that it might be subject to prejudgment interest if such interest was necessary to fashion an equitable remedy, we are unable to conclude with sufficient certainty that Colorado was on notice that such interest would be imposed as a matter of course. We, therefore, believe that the Special Master acted properly in carefully analyzing the facts of the case and in only awarding as much prejudgment interest as was required by a balancing of the equities.~    ~    ~      24~      We also agree with the Special Master that the equities in this case do not support an award of prejudgment interest from the date of the first violation of the Compact, but rather favor an award beginning on a later date. In reaching this conclusion, the Special Master appropriately considered several factors. In particular, he relied on the fact that in the early years after the Compact was signed, no one had any thought that the pact was being violated. Third Report 106. In addition, he considered the long interval that passed between the original injuries and these proceedings, as well as the dramatic impact of compounding interest over many years. Id., at 99-101; see also n. 3, supra.~    ~    ~      25~      In its exception, Kansas argues that the Special Master's reasoning would be appropriate if damages were being awarded as a form of punishment, but does not justify a refusal to provide full compensation to an injured party. Moreover, Kansas argues, a rule that rewards ignorance might discourage diligence in making sure that there is full compliance with the terms of the Compact. Kansas' argument is consistent with a \"rigid theory of compensation for money withheld,\" but, for the reasons discussed above, we are persuaded that the Special Master correctly declined to adopt such a theory. The equitable considerations identified by the Special Master fully justify his view that in this case it would be inappropriate to award prejudgment interest for any years before either party was aware of the excessive pumping in Colorado.~    ~    ~      26~      In its third exception, Colorado argues that, if prejudgment interest is to be awarded at all, the equities are best balanced by limiting such interest to the time after the complaint was filed, rather than the time after which Colorado knew or should have known that it was violating the Compact. Specifically, Colorado suggests that prejudgment interest should begin to accrue in 1985 rather than 1969. The choice between the two dates is surely debatable; it is a matter over which reasonable people can-and do-disagree. After examining the equities for ourselves, however, a majority of the Court has decided that the later date is the more appropriate.5~    ~    ~      27~      When we overruled Colorado's objections to the Special Master's second report, we held that Kansas was not guilty of inexcusable delay in failing to complain more promptly about post-Compact well-pumping. 514 U.S., at 687-689. In saying that the delay was not inexcusable, we recognized that the nature and extent of Colorado's violations continued to be unclear even in the years after which it became obvious that the Compact was being violated. Id., at 688-689. That conclusion is something of a two-edged sword, however. While Kansas' delay was understandable given the amorphous nature of its claims, there is no doubt that the interests of both States would have been served if the claim had been advanced promptly after its basis became known. Once it became obvious that a violation of the Compact had occurred, it was equally clear that the proceedings necessary to evaluate the significance of the violations would be complex and protracted. Despite the diligence of the parties and the Special Master, over 15 years have elapsed since the complaint was filed. Given the uncertainty over the scope of damages that prevailed during the period between 1968 and 1985 and the fact that it was uniquely in Kansas' power to begin the process by which those damages would be quantified, Colorado's request that we deny prejudgment interest for that period is reasonable.~    ~    ~      28~      For these reasons, we overrule Kansas' exception. We also overrule Colorado's third exception insofar as it challenges the interest rates recommended by the Special Master, but we sustain that objection insofar as it challenges the award of interest for the years prior to 1985.~    ~    IV~    ~      29~      Colorado's final objection challenges the Special Master's determination of the value of the crop losses attributable to the Compact violations, the largest component of Kansas' damages claim. The Special Master accomplished the calculation by estimating the amount of farmland affected by Colorado's violations, the crops planted on that farmland, the price of those crops, and the difference in yield between what the affected land would have produced with the additional water and what the land actually produced with the water it received.~    ~    ~      30~      The parties were in agreement concerning most of the facts bearing on the Special Master's calculation. They agreed that water was in short supply in the affected area each year, 178 Tr. 127-128; they agreed on the amount of the shortage that resulted from Colorado's violations, ibid.; and they generally agreed on which crops were planted on the affected farmland as well as the prices of those crops in the relevant years. See Third Report 46.~    ~    ~      31~      The only issue on which the parties disagreed was the exact effect of the diverted water on the crop yields for the farmland in question. On that score, both Kansas and Colorado accepted the general notion that \"[u]p to the point where crops no longer can make use of additional water, more water produces more crop yield.\" Id., at 47. But they parted ways on the question of precisely how much additional yield would have been produced with the missing water.6 Kansas' experts relied upon the hypothesis of a generally linear relationship between water available for use and increased crop yields. With figures drawn from a number of studies, Professor Norman Whittlesey, Kansas' principal expert,7 developed quantitative estimates of the lost yield, per unit of water, for the various crops grown on the affected farmland. Although Colorado's expert initially attempted to propose his own model, he ultimately abandoned his position when confronted with flaws in his data. 197 Tr. 44-46.~    ~    ~      32~      Its own expert having recanted his alternative proposal for calculating the effects of the diverted water on crop yield, Colorado attempts to poke holes in Kansas' methodology through a speculative application of abstract economic theory. Kansas' numbers (for crop losses due to diverted water) cannot be correct, Colorado argues, because if they were, it would have been economically profitable for the affected farmers to drill wells and obtain water from underground sources rather than suffer the reduced yield from the shortage of surface water. Brief for Colorado 41-49. Because Kansas farmers did not install wells, Colorado concludes, we can know that the diverted water was not as valuable as Kansas' experts claim.~    ~    ~      33~      The Special Master did not question Colorado's assertion that digging wells would, in retrospect, actually have been profitable for Kansas farmers, but he declined to employ Colorado's argument as a basis for rejecting Kansas' expert testimony on the extent of crop losses. His thoughtful analysis is worth quoting in full:~    ~    ~      34~      \"Given the hindsight of present day economists, it might have been profitable for everyone to drill supplemental wells ... . However, there are many reasons why this may not have been done, and the failure to drill wells does not by itself indicate that Kansas' estimate of crop losses is too high. The favorable economics of drilling wells may not have been understood at the time. Quality information regarding costs and returns was not readily available. [211 Tr.] 31. Some farmers, for reasons of age or otherwise, may not have wanted to go into long term debt. Some farmers may not have had the available capital, or the credit to borrow. Many farmers were 'cash poor.' Id. at 32. Some farmers may have been averse to risk. Some farmers may have been tenants, and the landlord may not have been willing to undertake the necessary investment. Some farms may have been small in terms of total acreage, or the acreage spread out over space, so that it was not feasible or practical to consider a well investment. [208 Tr.] 37-39. Capital for well investments, with three to ten year repayment periods, was less available than for long-term investments. [211 Tr.] 32.\" Third Report 60-61.~    ~    ~      35~      We agree with the Special Master that accepting Colorado's argument requires a good deal of speculation, not only about the comparative advantages of wells as opposed to irrigation, but also about the ability of the farmers fully to understand or to implement different choices without the benefit of expert hindsight. Given Colorado's inability to mount an effective challenge to Kansas' experts on their own terms and its complete failure to provide a plausible alternative estimate of the crop damage that resulted from its violations of the Compact, we conclude that its attack on Kansas' conclusions is unpersuasive.8~    ~    ~      36~      Colorado's fourth exception is overruled.~    ~    V~    ~      37~      We remand the case to the Special Master for preparation of a final judgment consistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      38~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      39~      O'Connor, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, in which Scalia and Thomas, JJ., joined.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         That Amendment provides: \"The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\"~      ~      ~        2~         Though final damages have not yet been calculated, the importance of this issue is illustrated by breaking down the damages claimed by Kansas. Of $62,369,173 in damages so claimed, $9,218,305 represents direct and indirect losses in actual dollars when the damage occurred. Of the remaining $53,150,867, about $12 million constitutes an adjustment for inflation (a type of interest that Colorado concedes is appropriate) while the remaining amount (approximately $41 million) represents additional interest intended to compensate for lost investment opportunities. Third Report of Special Master 87-88 (hereinafter Third Report). The magnitude of prejudgment interest ultimately awarded in this case will, of course, turn on the date from which interest accrues. See Part III-B, infra.~      ~      ~        3~         For sources from the early part of the century criticizing, qualifying, or rejecting the distinction, see, e.g., Faber v. New York, 222 N. Y. 255, 262, 118 N. E. 609, 610-611 (1918); Bernhard v. Rochester German Ins. Co., 79 Conn. 388, 398, 65 A. 134, 138 (1906); Restatement of Contracts 337, p. 542 (1932); C. McCormick, Law of Damages 51, p. 210 (1935); 1 T. Sedgwick, Measure of Damages 315 (9th ed. 1912); cf. 3 S. Williston, Law of Contracts 1413, p. 2508 (1920) (\"The disinclination to allow interest on claim of uncertain amount seems based on practice rather than theoretical grounds\"). For a thorough modern treatment of the issue, see D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies 3.6(3) (2d ed. 1993).~      ~      ~        4~         Justice O'Connor argues that the state of the law was insufficiently evolved by 1949 for Colorado to have had notice that the courts might award prejudgment interest if it violated its obligations under the Compact. See post, at 3-7 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). Though the law was indeed in flux at that time, this Court had already made it clear that it put no stock in the traditional common-law prohibition, see Funkhouser v. J. B. Preston Co., 290 U.S. 163, 168 (1933), and had stated explicitly that such interest may accrue when \"considerations of fairness\" demand it, see Board of Comm'rs of Jackson Cty. v. United States, 308 U.S. 343, 352 (1939). The contemporary Restatement of Contracts was in accord. See Restatement of Contracts 337(b), p. 542 (1932) (\"Where the contract that is broken [is not for a set or easily ascertainable amount of money], interest may be allowed in the discretion of the court, if justice requires it, on the amount that would have been just compensation if it had been paid when performance was due\"). Under those circumstances, we think it is clear that, in 1949, an informed contracting party would not have concluded that an agreement's silence on the issue deprived a reviewing court of the authority to award compensatory interest if the party willfully violated its contractual obligations. Moreover, under Justice O'Connor's reasoning, States who entered into interstate compacts before 1987, see post, at 4, would retain a perpetual incentive to breach their contractual obligations and reap the benefits of such a breach with the full knowledge that the courts lack the authority to order a fully compensatory remedy.~      ~      ~        5~         Justice O'Connor, Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas would not allow any prejudgment interest. See post, at 1. Justice Kennedy and The Chief Justice are of the opinion that prejudgment interest should run from the date of the filing of the complaint. Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, and the author of this opinion agree with the Special Master's view that interest should run from the time when Colorado knew or should have known that it was violating the Compact. In order to produce a majority for a judgment, the four Justices who agree with the Special Master have voted to endorse the position expressed in the text.~      ~      ~        6~         As the Special Master noted, \"Colorado experts did not dispute, in general, the linear relationship between [water usage] and crop yield... . However, they were of the view that the particular linear crop yield coefficients used by Kansas were not sufficiently reliable to determine the increase in yields that would have occurred if there had been no depletions of headgate deliveries to the [affected] lands.\" Third Report 47. Colorado suggests that Kansas' model, based as it is upon academic studies, does not adequately account for reductions in crop yield from such real-world conditions as \"weather, disease, and pests.\" Brief for Colorado 44, n. 12. But, as the Special Master correctly noted, Kansas' experts reduced the predicted crop yield by 25% in order to account for such possibilities. Third Report 51 (\"The 25% reduction was calculated to adjust the controlled experimental data to 'realistic long-term type conditions' in western Kansas, including high temperatures, winds, insects, and other stressful conditions\").~      ~      ~        7~         Professor Whittlesey served for 20 years as a full professor and agricultural economist at Washington State University. His publications, many of which concern the kind of issues presented by this case, fill 14 pages on his curriculum vitae. See Kan. Exh. 891.~      ~      ~        8~         We also agree with the Special Master's decision to disregard the Colorado expert's comparison of the numbers produced by Kansas' model with numbers drawn from the literature on the various crops planted on the affected farmland. As Colorado admits, see Brief for Colorado 46, the water values in the literature were not based on \"a 'short-short run' situation, that is, an intra-seasonal transaction in which no capital costs were involved, and only additional harvesting and irrigation costs would be required.\" Third Report 63. Because the circumstances in Kansas involved short-short run situations, and because such short-short run situations generally involve higher values for water, values derived from other contexts are of limited use in evaluating Kansas' model. See ibid.~      ~    ~    ~      40~      Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.~    ~    ~      41~      I agree with the Court's disposition of this case as to Colorado's first and fourth exceptions to the Special Master's Third Report, concerning the award and determination of damages. I therefore join Parts I, IV, and V of the Court's opinion. I do not concur in Parts II and III of the Court's opinion because I believe that the award of prejudgment interest to Kansas, coming over half a century after the Arkansas River Compact's (hereinafter Compact) negotiation and approval, is clearly improper under our precedents.~    ~    ~      42~      We are dealing with an interstate compact apportioning the flow of a river between two States. A compact is a contract. It represents a bargained-for exchange between its signatories and \"remains a legal document that must be construed and applied in accordance with its terms.\" Texas v. New Mexico, 482 U.S. 124, 128 (1987); see also Petty v. Tennesseenbhyph;Missouri Bridge Comm'n, 359 U.S. 275, 285 (1959) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting) (\"A Compact is, after all, a contract\"). It is a fundamental tenet of contract law that parties to a contract are deemed to have contracted with reference to principles of law existing at the time the contract was made. See, e.g., Norfolk  Western R. Co. v. Train Dispatchers, 499 U.S. 117, 129-130 (1991); Farmers and Merchants Bank of Monroe v. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, 262 U.S. 649, 660 (1923); see generally 11 Williston on Contracts 30:19 (4th ed. 1999). The basic question before the Court is thus one of \"the fair intendment of the contract itself.\" Virginia v. West Virginia, 238 U.S. 202, 233 (1915). Specifically, the question is whether, at the time the Compact was negotiated and approved, Colorado and Kansas could fairly be said to have intended, or at least to have expected or assumed, that Colorado might be exposing itself to liability for prejudgment interest in the event of the Compact's breach. Cf. id., at 232-236 (awarding interest to Virginia in a suit against West Virginia for breach of a contract to assume \"an equitable proportion\" of Virginia's interest-bearing public debt upon finding that \"there is no escape from the conclusion that there was a contract duty on the part of West Virginia to provide for accruing interest as a part of the equitable proportion assumed\").~    ~    ~      43~      I fail to see how Colorado and Kansas could have contemplated that prejudgment interest would be awarded. The \"venerable ... rule\" at common law was that prejudgment interest was unavailable on claims for unliquidated or, even more significantly, unascertainable damages. Milwaukee v. Cement Div., National Gypsum Co., 515 U.S. 189, 197 (1995). Contrary to the Court's suggestion, see ante, at 6-8, 11, that rule had not been abandoned by the period between 1943 and 1949, the years of the Compact's negotiation and ultimate approval by Congress. By that time, the state of the law in general regarding awards of prejudgment interest for unliquidated claims was uncertain at best, as the Court itself recognizes. See ante, at 6-8, and n. 3; cf. ante, at 11; see also Funkhouser v. J. B. Preston Co., 290 U.S. 163, 168 (1933) (noting \"the numerous, and not harmonious, decisions upon the allowance of interest in the case of unliquidated claims,\" and that \"the rule with respect to unliquidated claims has been in evolution\"). To be sure, we had by then, along with other courts, criticized the common law rule that prejudgment interest was recoverable on claims for liquidated but not for unliquidated damages. See ibid. But in the absence of a statute providing for such interest, many courts, including our own, still denied and would continue to deny prejudgment interest on claims for unliquidated and unascertainable damages in a great many, and probably most, circumstances. See, e.g., Board of Comm'rs of Jackson Cty. v. United States, 308 U.S. 343, 353 (1939); Blau v. Lehman, 368 U.S. 403, 414 (1962); Lineman v. Schmid, 32 Cal. 2d 204, 211, 195 P.2d 408, 412 (1948) (Although \"there is authority to the effect that the distinction formerly existing between liquidated and unliquidated demands is practically obliterated, ... further reading ... discloses, with citation of many cases, that the general rule is almost uniformly adhered to, namely, that interest is not allowable where the damages depend upon no fixed standard and cannot be made certain except by accord, verdict or decree\"); D. Dobbs, Remedies 3.5, p. 165 (1973) (\"Most courts, in the absence of a statute to the contrary, would not award interest on unliquidated pecuniary claims, the amount of which could not be ascertained or computed, even in theory, without a trial\"); see generally C. McCormick, Law of Damages 51, p. 210 (1935) (explaining evolution of rule in America); see also 1 D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies 3.6(1), p. 336 (2d ed. 1993) (\"The most significant limitation on the recovery of prejudgment interest is the general rule that, apart from statute, prejudgment interest is not recoverable on claims that are neither liquidated as a dollar sum nor ascertainable by fixed standards\" (footnotes omitted)).~    ~    ~      44~      Awards of such interest on claims for unliquidated and unascertainable damages for breach of a contract appear to have been rarer still. See, e.g., Williams v. Idaho Potato Starch Co., 73 Idaho 13, 24, 245 P.2d 1045, 1051-1052 (1952); Meyer v. Strom, 37 Wash. 2d 818, 829-830, 226 P.2d 218, 224 (1951); Lineman v. Schmid, supra, at 207- 213, 195 P.2d, at 410-413; see also 3 Williston on Contracts 1413, p. 2508 (1920) (\"Interest is not generally allowed ... where market rates or prices furnish no definite or exact test of the amount due\" (footnote omitted)); 1 T. Sedgwick, Measure of Damages 315, p. 614 (9th ed. 1912) (\"Generally speaking, no interest can be recovered for breach of a contract, where the damages are in their nature unliquidated, until the amount is ascertained\" (footnote omitted)). In fact, at the time, they were not allowed in either Colorado or Kansas. See, e.g., Clark v. Giacomini, 85 Colo. 530, 536-537, 277 P. 306, 308 (1929); Denver Horse Imp. Co. v. Schafer, 58 Colo. 376, 390, 147 P. 367, 372 (1915); Roe v. Snattinger, 91 Kan. 567, 568, 138 P. 581, 582 (1914); Evans v. Moseley, 84 Kan. 322, 332-333, 114 P. 374, 378 (1911).~    ~    ~      45~      Finally, and most important to this case, an award of prejudgment interest on unliquidated and unascertainable damages for breach of an interstate compact was unheard of at the time of the Compact's negotiation and approval. Unlike cases involving bonds or other instruments of credit, see, e.g., Virginia v. West Virginia, supra, at 232- 36; South Dakota v. North Carolina, 192 U.S. 286, 317- 321 (1904), monetary damages in cases of this sort, involving the apportionment of water between States, are notoriously difficult to ascertain. Indeed, despite 15 years of litigation over the Compact, and resort to a great deal of data, expert testimony, complicated methodologies, and sophisticated analyses on the subject, the final value of Kansas' damages still has yet to be determined. See ante, at 6, n. 2; see also Third Report III to X (detailing and analyzing the numerous variables and data elements necessary to arrive at a determination of Kansas' damages). It thus is not surprising that, until 1987, we had never even suggested that monetary damages could be recovered from a State as a remedy for its violation of an interstate compact apportioning the flow of an interstate stream. And when we first allowed such damages in Texas v. New Mexico, 482 U.S. 124 (1987), we did so partially at the behest of New Mexico, the breaching State. See id., at 129-132. How, then, can one say that, at the time the Compact was negotiated and approved, its signatories could fairly be said to have intended, or at least could reasonably be said to have expected or assumed, that Kansas might recover prejudgment interest on damages caused by Colorado's breach? The necessary predicate to such a recovery was neither recognized nor even contemplated by this Court or, apparently, by the state parties to original actions of this sort, until some 40 years thence.~    ~    ~      46~      In light of this history, it seems inescapable that any participant in the drafting and negotiation of the Compact would, if asked at the time, have reacted with marked surprise to the notion that the Compact rendered its signatories liable for an award of prejudgment interest such as that sanctioned by the Court today. As both the Compact itself and the parties' post-Compact course of dealing make clear, the \"fair intendment\" of the Compact very probably was simply for the in-kind recovery of water as a remedy for its breach. The Compact says nothing about the availability of prejudgment interest on money damages as part of any remedy or, for that matter, about the availability of money damages as a remedy in the first instance. It contemplates the delivery of water from Colorado to Kansas, pure and simple. See Arkansas River Compact, reprinted in App. to Brief for Kansas A-1. When Kansas filed its complaint in this matter, \"it sought only a decree commanding Colorado 'to deliver the waters of the Arkansas River in accordance with the provisions of the Arkansas River Compact.' \" Third Report XI, at 98. Cf. Colorado v. Kansas, 320 U.S. 383, 391 (1943) (discussing Kansas' prayer for relief in the form of \"an apportionment in second feet or acre feet\"). Not until our decision in Texas v. New Mexico, supra, did Kansas amend its complaint to include a claim for monetary damages. See Third Report XI, at 98. Neither Kansas nor Colorado appears ever to have anticipated or assumed, much less expected, that the Compact might result in a monetary award of prejudgment interest over half a century after its signing.~    ~    ~      47~      The Court ignores all of this in awarding prejudgment interest to Kansas, seizing instead upon the compensatory rationale behind the criticism of the common law rule and awards of prejudgment interest on unliquidated claims for damages in general. See ante, at 7-8. I do not dispute that awards of interest are compensatory in nature or that, as a general matter, \"a monetary award does not fully compensate for an injury unless it includes an interest component.\" Ante, at 8; see also National Gypsum Co., 515 U.S., at 195, n. 7. But, as the Court itself recognizes, see ante, at 8, our precedents make clear that, at least today and in the absence of a governing statute, awards of prejudgment interest on unliquidated claims for damages are governed not by any \"rigid theory of compensation for money withheld,\" but rather by \"considerations of fairness.\" Blau, 368 U.S., at 414 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see, e.g., General Motors Corp. v. Devex Corp., 461 U.S. 648, 651-653, and n. 5 (1983); Funkhouser, 290 U.S., at 168-169. This is especially so where, as here, we are dealing with suits by one governmental body against another. See West Virginia v. United States, 479 U.S. 305, 309-312 (1987); Board of Comm'rs of Jackson Cty., 308 U.S., at 349-353.~    ~    ~      48~      There is nothing fair about awarding prejudgment interest as a remedy for the Compact's breach when all available evidence suggests that the signatories to the Compact neither intended nor contemplated such an unconventional remedy. Many compacts between States are old; suits involving compacts concerning water rights are late in starting and are invariably long pending; and, because statutes of limitation or the doctrine of laches is rarely available to preclude the steady buildup of prejudgment interest, the amount of such interest can become quite large, as Kansas' claim for approximately $41 million illustrates. See ante, at 6, n. 2. One would think that, particularly in such circumstances, even the most rudimentary conception of fairness would dictate that the Court ought not to interpret a contract between two States as exposing one of them to liability under a novel legal principle some 50 years later without some indication that the States might have contemplated such exposure in conjunction with the contractual rights and duties expressed in their compact. Contrary to the Court's apparent belief, see ante, at 8, n. 4, nothing about such a contextualized historical approach would create an across-the-board incentive for the continued breach of interstate compacts entered into before 1987, especially given the prospect of large and uncertain damages awards. Had Kansas and Colorado anticipated or even suspected what the Court today effects, they almost certainly would have negotiated a provision in the Compact to address the situation. States in the future very likely will do so in the wake of the Court's decision, which creates a very different backdrop from the one against which Kansas and Colorado operated. In the absence of such a provision, however, \"the loss [as to interest] should remain where it has fallen.\" Board of Comm'rs of Jackson Cty., supra, at 353; see Third Report XI, at 101 (\"Prejudgment interest here neither takes from those who benefitted, nor goes to those who were injured\").~    ~    ~      49~      For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent from the Court's award of prejudgment interest.~    ~    ",

Readers are requested to notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D. C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.DANNY LEE KYLLO, PETITIONERv.UNITED STATES~    No. 99-8508.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued February 20, 2001Decided June 11, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      Suspicious that marijuana was being grown in petitioner Kyllo's home in a triplex, agents used a thermal imaging device to scan the triplex to determine if the amount of heat emanating from it was consistent with the high-intensity lamps typically used for indoor marijuana growth. The scan showed that Kyllo's garage roof and a side wall were relatively hot compared to the rest of his home and substantially warmer than the neighboring units. Based in part on the thermal imaging, a Federal Magistrate Judge issued a warrant to search Kyllo's home, where the agents found marijuana growing. After Kyllo was indicted on a federal drug charge, he unsuccessfully moved to suppress the evidence seized from his home and then entered a conditional guilty plea. The Ninth Circuit ultimately affirmed, upholding the thermal imaging on the ground that Kyllo had shown no subjective expectation of privacy because he had made no attempt to conceal the heat escaping from his home. Even if he had, ruled the court, there was no objectively reasonable expectation of privacy because the thermal imager did not expose any intimate details of Kyllo's life, only amorphous hot spots on his home's exterior.~      Held: Where, as here, the Government uses a device that is not in general public use, to explore details of a private home that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion, the surveillance is a Fourth Amendment \"search,\" and is presumptively unreasonable without a warrant. Pp. 3-13.~      (a) The question whether a warrantless search of a home is reasonable and hence constitutional must be answered no in most instances, but the antecedent question whether a Fourth Amendment \"search\" has occurred is not so simple. This Court has approved warrantless visual surveillance of a home, see California v. Ciraolo, 476 U.S. 207, 213, ruling that visual observation is no \"search\" at all, see Dow Chemical Co. v. United States, 476 U.S. 227, 234-235, 239. In assessing when a search is not a search, the Court has adapted a principle first enunciated in Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 361: A \"search\" does not occur-even when its object is a house explicitly protected by the Fourth Amendment-unless the individual manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the searched object, and society is willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable, see, e.g., California v. Ciraolo, supra, at 211. Pp. 3-5.~      (b) While it may be difficult to refine the Katz test in some instances, in the case of the search of a home's interior-the prototypical and hence most commonly litigated area of protected privacy-there is a ready criterion, with roots deep in the common law, of the minimal expectation of privacy that exists, and that is acknowledged to be reasonable. To withdraw protection of this minimum expectation would be to permit police technology to erode the privacy guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment. Thus, obtaining by sense-enhancing technology any information regarding the home's interior that could not otherwise have been obtained without physical \"intrusion into a constitutionally protected area,\" Silverman v. United States, 365 U.S. 505, 512, constitutes a search-at least where (as here) the technology in question is not in general public use. This assures preservation of that degree of privacy against government that existed when the Fourth Amendment was adopted. Pp. 6-7.~      (c) Based on this criterion, the information obtained by the thermal imager in this case was the product of a search. The Court rejects the Government's argument that the thermal imaging must be upheld because it detected only heat radiating from the home's external surface. Such a mechanical interpretation of the Fourth Amendment was rejected in Katz, where the eavesdropping device in question picked up only sound waves that reached the exterior of the phone booth to which it was attached. Reversing that approach would leave the homeowner at the mercy of advancing technology-including imaging technology that could discern all human activity in the home. Also rejected is the Government's contention that the thermal imaging was constitutional because it did not detect \"intimate details.\" Such an approach would be wrong in principle because, in the sanctity of the home, all details are intimate details. See e.g., United States v. Karo, 468 U.S. 705; Dow Chemical, supra, at 238, distinguished. It would also be impractical in application, failing to provide a workable accommodation between law enforcement needs and Fourth Amendment interests. See Oliver v. United States, 466 U.S. 170, 181. Pp. 7-12.~      (d) Since the imaging in this case was an unlawful search, it will remain for the District Court to determine whether, without the evidence it provided, the search warrant was supported by probable cause-and if not, whether there is any other basis for supporting admission of that evidence. Pp. 12-13. 190 F.3d 1041, reversed and remanded.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT~      Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Souter, Thomas, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      This case presents the question whether the use of a thermal-imaging device aimed at a private home from a public street to detect relative amounts of heat within the home constitutes a \"search\" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.~    ~    ~      2~      * In 1991 Agent William Elliott of the United States Department of the Interior came to suspect that marijuana was being grown in the home belonging to petitioner Danny Kyllo, part of a triplex on Rhododendron Drive in Florence, Oregon. Indoor marijuana growth typically requires high-intensity lamps. In order to determine whether an amount of heat was emanating from petitioner's home consistent with the use of such lamps, at 3:20 a.m. on January 16, 1992, Agent Elliott and Dan Haas used an Agema Thermovision 210 thermal imager to scan the triplex. Thermal imagers detect infrared radiation, which virtually all objects emit but which is not visible to the naked eye. The imager converts radiation into images based on relative warmth-black is cool, white is hot, shades of gray connote relative differences; in that respect, it operates somewhat like a video camera showing heat images. The scan of Kyllo's home took only a few minutes and was performed from the passenger seat of Agent Elliott's vehicle across the street from the front of the house and also from the street in back of the house. The scan showed that the roof over the garage and a side wall of petitioner's home were relatively hot compared to the rest of the home and substantially warmer than neighboring homes in the triplex. Agent Elliott concluded that petitioner was using halide lights to grow marijuana in his house, which indeed he was. Based on tips from informants, utility bills, and the thermal imaging, a Federal Magistrate Judge issued a warrant authorizing a search of petitioner's home, and the agents found an indoor growing operation involving more than 100 plants. Petitioner was indicted on one count of manufacturing marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C.  841(a)(1). He unsuccessfully moved to suppress the evidence seized from his home and then entered a conditional guilty plea.~    ~    ~      3~      The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing regarding the intrusiveness of thermal imaging. On remand the District Court found that the Agema 210 \"is a non-intrusive device which emits no rays or beams and shows a crude visual image of the heat being radiated from the outside of the house\"; it \"did not show any people or activity within the walls of the structure\"; \"[t]he device used cannot penetrate walls or windows to reveal conversations or human activities\"; and \"[n]o intimate details of the home were observed.\" Supp. App. to Pet. for Cert. 39-40. Based on these findings, the District Court upheld the validity of the warrant that relied in part upon the thermal imaging, and reaffirmed its denial of the motion to suppress. A divided Court of Appeals initially reversed, 140 F.3d 1249 (1998), but that opinion was withdrawn and the panel (after a change in composition) affirmed, 190 F.3d 1041 (1999), with Judge Noonan dissenting. The court held that petitioner had shown no subjective expectation of privacy because he had made no attempt to conceal the heat escaping from his home, id., at 1046, and even if he had, there was no objectively reasonable expectation of privacy because the imager \"did not expose any intimate details of Kyllo's life,\" only \"amorphous 'hot spots' on the roof and exterior wall,\" id., at 1047. We granted certiorari. 530 U.S. 1305 (2000).~    ~    II~    ~      4~      The Fourth Amendment provides that \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\" \"At the very core\" of the Fourth Amendment \"stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.\" Silverman v. United States, 365 U.S. 505, 511 (1961). With few exceptions, the question whether a warrantless search of a home is reasonable and hence constitutional must be answered no. See Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U.S. 177, 181 (1990); Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 586 (1980).~    ~    ~      5~      On the other hand, the antecedent question of whether or not a Fourth Amendment \"search\" has occurred is not so simple under our precedent. The permissibility of ordinary visual surveillance of a home used to be clear because, well into the 20th century, our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence was tied to common-law trespass. See, e.g., Goldman v. United States, 316 U.S. 129, 134-136 (1942); Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 464-466 (1928). Cf. Silverman v. United States, supra, at 510-512 (technical trespass not necessary for Fourth Amendment violation; it suffices if there is \"actual intrusion into a constitutionally protected area\"). Visual surveillance was unquestionably lawful because \" 'the eye cannot by the laws of England be guilty of a trespass.' \" Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 628 (1886) (quoting Entick v. Carrington, 19 How. St. Tr. 1029, 95 Eng. Rep. 807 (K. B. 1765)). We have since decoupled violation of a person's Fourth Amendment rights from trespassory violation of his property, see Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, 143 (1978), but the lawfulness of warrantless visual surveillance of a home has still been preserved. As we observed in California v. Ciraolo, 476 U.S. 207, 213 (1986), \"[t]he Fourth Amendment protection of the home has never been extended to require law enforcement officers to shield their eyes when passing by a home on public thoroughfares.\"~    ~    ~      6~      One might think that the new validating rationale would be that examining the portion of a house that is in plain public view, while it is a \"search\"1 despite the absence of trespass, is not an \"unreasonable\" one under the Fourth Amendment. See Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U.S. 83, 104 (1998) (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment). But in fact we have held that visual observation is no \"search\" at all-perhaps in order to preserve somewhat more intact our doctrine that warrantless searches are presumptively unconstitutional. See Dow Chemical Co. v. United States, 476 U.S. 227, 234-235, 239 (1986). In assessing when a search is not a search, we have applied somewhat in reverse the principle first enunciated in Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967). Katz involved eavesdropping by means of an electronic listening device placed on the outside of a telephone booth-a location not within the catalog (\"persons, houses, papers, and effects\") that the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches. We held that the Fourth Amendment nonetheless protected Katz from the warrantless eavesdropping because he \"justifiably relied\" upon the privacy of the telephone booth. Id., at 353. As Justice Harlan's oft-quoted concurrence described it, a Fourth Amendment search occurs when the government violates a subjective expectation of privacy that society recognizes as reasonable. See id., at 361. We have subsequently applied this principle to hold that a Fourth Amendment search does not occur-even when the explicitly protected location of a house is concerned-unless \"the individual manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the object of the challenged search,\" and \"society [is] willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable.\" Ciraolo, supra, at 211. We have applied this test in holding that it is not a search for the police to use a pen register at the phone company to determine what numbers were dialed in a private home, Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 743-744 (1979), and we have applied the test on two different occasions in holding that aerial surveillance of private homes and surrounding areas does not constitute a search, Ciraolo, supra; Florida v. Riley, 488 U.S. 445 (1989).~    ~    ~      7~      The present case involves officers on a public street engaged in more than naked-eye surveillance of a home. We have previously reserved judgment as to how much technological enhancement of ordinary perception from such a vantage point, if any, is too much. While we upheld enhanced aerial photography of an industrial complex in Dow Chemical, we noted that we found \"it important that this is not an area immediately adjacent to a private home, where privacy expectations are most heightened,\" 476 U.S., at 237, n. 4 (emphasis in original).~    ~    III~    ~      8~      It would be foolish to contend that the degree of privacy secured to citizens by the Fourth Amendment has been entirely unaffected by the advance of technology. For example, as the cases discussed above make clear, the technology enabling human flight has exposed to public view (and hence, we have said, to official observation) uncovered portions of the house and its curtilage that once were private. See Ciraolo, supra, at 215. The question we confront today is what limits there are upon this power of technology to shrink the realm of guaranteed privacy.~    ~    ~      9~      The Katz test-whether the individual has an expectation of privacy that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable-has often been criticized as circular, and hence subjective and unpredictable. See 1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure 2.1(d), pp. 393-394 (3d ed. 1996); Posner, The Uncertain Protection of Privacy by the Supreme Court, 1979 S. Ct. Rev. 173, 188; Carter, supra, at 97 (Scalia, J., concurring). But see Rakas, supra, at 143-144, n. 12. While it may be difficult to refine Katz when the search of areas such as telephone booths, automobiles, or even the curtilage and uncovered portions of residences are at issue, in the case of the search of the interior of homes-the prototypical and hence most commonly litigated area of protected privacy-there is a ready criterion, with roots deep in the common law, of the minimal expectation of privacy that exists, and that is acknowledged to be reasonable. To withdraw protection of this minimum expectation would be to permit police technology to erode the privacy guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment. We think that obtaining by sense-enhancing technology any information regarding the interior of the home that could not otherwise have been obtained without physical \"intrusion into a constitutionally protected area,\" Silverman, 365 U.S., at 512, constitutes a search-at least where (as here) the technology in question is not in general public use. This assures preservation of that degree of privacy against government that existed when the Fourth Amendment was adopted. On the basis of this criterion, the information obtained by the thermal imager in this case was the product of a search.2~    ~    ~      10~      The Government maintains, however, that the thermal imaging must be upheld because it detected \"only heat radiating from the external surface of the house,\" Brief for United States 26. The dissent makes this its leading point, see post, at 1, contending that there is a fundamental difference between what it calls \"off-the-wall\" observations and \"through-the-wall surveillance.\" But just as a thermal imager captures only heat emanating from a house, so also a powerful directional microphone picks up only sound emanating from a house-and a satellite capable of scanning from many miles away would pick up only visible light emanating from a house. We rejected such a mechanical interpretation of the Fourth Amendment in Katz, where the eavesdropping device picked up only sound waves that reached the exterior of the phone booth. Reversing that approach would leave the homeowner at the mercy of advancing technology-including imaging technology that could discern all human activity in the home. While the technology used in the present case was relatively crude, the rule we adopt must take account of more sophisticated systems that are already in use or in development.3 The dissent's reliance on the distinction between \"off-the-wall\" and \"through-the-wall\" observation is entirely incompatible with the dissent's belief, which we discuss below, that thermal-imaging observations of the intimate details of a home are impermissible. The most sophisticated thermal imaging devices continue to measure heat \"off-the-wall\" rather than \"through-the-wall\"; the dissent's disapproval of those more sophisticated thermal-imaging devices, see post, at 10, is an acknowledgement that there is no substance to this distinction. As for the dissent's extraordinary assertion that anything learned through \"an inference\" cannot be a search, see post, at 4-5, that would validate even the \"through-the-wall\" technologies that the dissent purports to disapprove. Surely the dissent does not believe that the through-the-wall radar or ultrasound technology produces an 8-by-10 Kodak glossy that needs no analysis (i.e., the making of inferences). And, of course, the novel proposition that inference insulates a search is blatantly contrary to United States v. Karo, 468 U.S. 705 (1984), where the police \"inferred\" from the activation of a beeper that a certain can of ether was in the home. The police activity was held to be a search, and the search was held unlawful.4~    ~    ~      11~      The Government also contends that the thermal imaging was constitutional because it did not \"detect private activities occurring in private areas,\" Brief for United States 22. It points out that in Dow Chemical we observed that the enhanced aerial photography did not reveal any \"intimate details.\" 476 U.S., at 238. Dow Chemical, however, involved enhanced aerial photography of an industrial complex, which does not share the Fourth Amendment sanctity of the home. The Fourth Amendment's protection of the home has never been tied to measurement of the quality or quantity of information obtained. In Silverman, for example, we made clear that any physical invasion of the structure of the home, \"by even a fraction of an inch,\" was too much, 365 U.S., at 512, and there is certainly no exception to the warrant requirement for the officer who barely cracks open the front door and sees nothing but the nonintimate rug on the vestibule floor. In the home, our cases show, all details are intimate details, because the entire area is held safe from prying government eyes. Thus, in Karo, supra, the only thing detected was a can of ether in the home; and in Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U.S. 321 (1987), the only thing detected by a physical search that went beyond what officers lawfully present could observe in \"plain view\" was the registration number of a phonograph turntable. These were intimate details because they were details of the home, just as was the detail of how warm-or even how relatively warm-Kyllo was heating his residence.5~    ~    ~      12~      Limiting the prohibition of thermal imaging to \"intimate details\" would not only be wrong in principle; it would be impractical in application, failing to provide \"a workable accommodation between the needs of law enforcement and the interests protected by the Fourth Amendment,\" Oliver v. United States, 466 U.S. 170, 181 (1984). To begin with, there is no necessary connection between the sophistication of the surveillance equipment and the \"intimacy\" of the details that it observes-which means that one cannot say (and the police cannot be assured) that use of the relatively crude equipment at issue here will always be lawful. The Agema Thermovision 210 might disclose, for example, at what hour each night the lady of the house takes her daily sauna and bath-a detail that many would consider \"intimate\"; and a much more sophisticated system might detect nothing more intimate than the fact that someone left a closet light on. We could not, in other words, develop a rule approving only that through-the-wall surveillance which identifies objects no smaller than 36 by 36 inches, but would have to develop a jurisprudence specifying which home activities are \"intimate\" and which are not. And even when (if ever) that jurisprudence were fully developed, no police officer would be able to know in advance whether his through-the-wall surveillance picks up \"intimate\" details-and thus would be unable to know in advance whether it is constitutional.~    ~    ~      13~      The dissent's proposed standard-whether the technology offers the \"functional equivalent of actual presence in the area being searched,\" post, at 7-would seem quite similar to our own at first blush. The dissent concludes that Katz was such a case, but then inexplicably asserts that if the same listening device only revealed the volume of the conversation, the surveillance would be permissible, post, at 10. Yet if, without technology, the police could not discern volume without being actually present in the phone booth, Justice Stevens should conclude a search has occurred. Cf. Karo, supra, at 735 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\"I find little comfort in the Court's notion that no invasion of privacy occurs until a listener obtains some significant information by use of the device... . A bathtub is a less private area when the plumber is present even if his back is turned\"). The same should hold for the interior heat of the home if only a person present in the home could discern the heat. Thus the driving force of the dissent, despite its recitation of the above standard, appears to be a distinction among different types of information-whether the \"homeowner would even care if anybody noticed,\" post, at 10. The dissent offers no practical guidance for the application of this standard, and for reasons already discussed, we believe there can be none. The people in their houses, as well as the police, deserve more precision.6~    ~    ~      14~      We have said that the Fourth Amendment draws \"a firm line at the entrance to the house,\" Payton, 445 U.S., at 590. That line, we think, must be not only firm but also bright-which requires clear specification of those methods of surveillance that require a warrant. While it is certainly possible to conclude from the videotape of the thermal imaging that occurred in this case that no \"significant\" compromise of the homeowner's privacy has occurred, we must take the long view, from the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment forward. \"The Fourth Amendment is to be construed in the light of what was deemed an unreasonable search and seizure when it was adopted, and in a manner which will conserve public interests as well as the interests and rights of individual citizens.\" Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 149 (1925).~    ~    ~      15~      Where, as here, the Government uses a device that is not in general public use, to explore details of the home that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion, the surveillance is a \"search\" and is presumptively unreasonable without a warrant.~    ~    ~      16~      Since we hold the Thermovision imaging to have been an unlawful search, it will remain for the District Court to determine whether, without the evidence it provided, the search warrant issued in this case was supported by probable cause-and if not, whether there is any other basis for supporting admission of the evidence that the search pursuant to the warrant produced.~    ~    ~      17~      * * *~    ~    ~      18~      The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed; the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      19~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      20~      Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor and Kennedy, JJ., joined.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         When the Fourth Amendment was adopted, as now, to \"search\" meant \"[t]o look over or through for the purpose of finding something; to explore; to examine by inspection; as, to search the house for a book; to search the wood for a thief.\" N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language 66 (1828) (reprint 6th ed. 1989).~      ~      ~        2~         The dissent's repeated assertion that the thermal imaging did not obtain information regarding the interior of the home, post, at 3, 4 (opinion of Stevens, J.), is simply inaccurate. A thermal imager reveals the relative heat of various rooms in the home. The dissent may not find that information particularly private or important, see post, at 4, 5, 10, but there is no basis for saying it is not information regarding the interior of the home. The dissent's comparison of the thermal imaging to various circumstances in which outside observers might be able to perceive, without technology, the heat of the home-for example, by observing snowmelt on the roof, post, at 3-is quite irrelevant. The fact that equivalent information could sometimes be obtained by other means does not make lawful the use of means that violate the Fourth Amendment. The police might, for example, learn how many people are in a particular house by setting up year-round surveillance; but that does not make breaking and entering to find out the same information lawful. In any event, on the night of January 16, 1992, no outside observer could have discerned the relative heat of Kyllo's home without thermal imaging.~      ~      ~        3~         The ability to \"see\" through walls and other opaque barriers is a clear, and scientifically feasible, goal of law enforcement research and development. The National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Center, a program within the United States Department of Justice, features on its Internet Website projects that include a \"Radar-Based Through-the-Wall Surveillance System,\" \"Handheld Ultrasound Through the Wall Surveillance,\" and a \"Radar Flashlight\" that \"will enable law officers to detect individuals through interior building walls.\" www.nlectc.org/techproj/ (visited May 3, 2001). Some devices may emit low levels of radiation that travel \"through-the-wall,\" but others, such as more sophisticated thermal imaging devices, are entirely passive, or \"off-the-wall\" as the dissent puts it.~      ~      ~        4~         The dissent asserts, post, at 5, n. 3, that we have misunderstood its point, which is not that inference insulates a search, but that inference alone is not a search. If we misunderstood the point, it was only in a good-faith effort to render the point germane to the case at hand. The issue in this case is not the police's allegedly unlawful inferencing, but their allegedly unlawful thermal-imaging measurement of the emanations from a house. We say such measurement is a search; the dissent says it is not, because an inference is not a search. We took that to mean that, since the technologically enhanced emanations had to be the basis of inferences before anything inside the house could be known, the use of the emanations could not be a search. But the dissent certainly knows better than we what it intends. And if it means only that an inference is not a search, we certainly agree. That has no bearing, however, upon whether hi-tech measurement of emanations from a house is a search.~      ~      ~        5~         The Government cites our statement in California v. Ciraolo, 476 U.S. 207 (1986), noting apparent agreement with the State of California that aerial surveillance of a house's curtilage could become \" 'invasive' \" if \" 'modern technology' \" revealed \" 'those intimate associations, objects or activities otherwise imperceptible to police or fellow citizens.' \" Id., at 215, n. 3 (quoting brief of the State of California). We think the Court's focus in this second-hand dictum was not upon intimacy but upon otherwise-imperceptibility, which is precisely the principle we vindicate today.~      ~      ~        6~         The dissent argues that we have injected potential uncertainty into the constitutional analysis by noting that whether or not the technology is in general public use may be a factor. See post, at 7-8. That quarrel, however, is not with us but with this Court's precedent. See Ciraolo, supra, at 215 (\"In an age where private and commercial flight in the public airways is routine, it is unreasonable for respondent to expect that his marijuana plants were constitutionally protected from being observed with the naked eye from an altitude of 1,000 feet\"). Given that we can quite confidently say that thermal imaging is not \"routine,\" we decline in this case to reexamine that factor.~      ~    ~    ~      21~      Justice Stevens, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice O'Connor, and Justice Kennedy join, dissenting.~    ~    ~      22~      There is, in my judgment, a distinction of constitutional magnitude between \"through-the-wall surveillance\" that gives the observer or listener direct access to information in a private area, on the one hand, and the thought processes used to draw inferences from information in the public domain, on the other hand. The Court has crafted a rule that purports to deal with direct observations of the inside of the home, but the case before us merely involves indirect deductions from \"off-the-wall\" surveillance, that is, observations of the exterior of the home. Those observations were made with a fairly primitive thermal imager that gathered data exposed on the outside of petitioner's home but did not invade any constitutionally protected interest in privacy.1 Moreover, I believe that the supposedly \"bright-line\" rule the Court has created in response to its concerns about future technological developments is unnecessary, unwise, and inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment.~    ~    ~      23~      * There is no need for the Court to craft a new rule to decide this case, as it is controlled by established principles from our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. One of those core principles, of course, is that \"searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable.\" Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 586 (1980) (emphasis added). But it is equally well settled that searches and seizures of property in plain view are presumptively reasonable. See id., at 586-587.2 Whether that property is residential or commercial, the basic principle is the same: \" 'What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.' \" California v. Ciraolo, 476 U.S. 207, 213 (1986) (quoting Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 351 (1967)); see Florida v. Riley, 488 U.S. 445, 449-450 (1989); California v. Greenwood, 486 U.S. 35, 40-41 (1988); Dow Chemical Co. v. United States, 476 U.S. 227, 235-236 (1986); Air Pollution Variance Bd. of Colo. v. Western Alfalfa Corp., 416 U.S. 861, 865 (1974). That is the principle implicated here.~    ~    ~      24~      While the Court \"take[s] the long view\" and decides this case based largely on the potential of yet-to-be-developed technology that might allow \"through-the-wall surveillance,\" ante, at 11-12; see ante, at 8, n. 3, this case involves nothing more than off-the-wall surveillance by law enforcement officers to gather information exposed to the general public from the outside of petitioner's home. All that the infrared camera did in this case was passively measure heat emitted from the exterior surfaces of petitioner's home; all that those measurements showed were relative differences in emission levels, vaguely indicating that some areas of the roof and outside walls were warmer than others. As still images from the infrared scans show, see Appendix, infra, no details regarding the interior of petitioner's home were revealed. Unlike an x-ray scan, or other possible \"through-the-wall\" techniques, the detection of infrared radiation emanating from the home did not accomplish \"an unauthorized physical penetration into the premises,\" Silverman v. United States, 365 U.S. 505, 509 (1961), nor did it \"obtain information that it could not have obtained by observation from outside the curtilage of the house,\" United States v. Karo, 468 U.S. 705, 715 (1984).~    ~    ~      25~      Indeed, the ordinary use of the senses might enable a neighbor or passerby to notice the heat emanating from a building, particularly if it is vented, as was the case here. Additionally, any member of the public might notice that one part of a house is warmer than another part or a nearby building if, for example, rainwater evaporates or snow melts at different rates across its surfaces. Such use of the senses would not convert into an unreasonable search if, instead, an adjoining neighbor allowed an officer onto her property to verify her perceptions with a sensitive thermometer. Nor, in my view, does such observation become an unreasonable search if made from a distance with the aid of a device that merely discloses that the exterior of one house, or one area of the house, is much warmer than another. Nothing more occurred in this case.~    ~    ~      26~      Thus, the notion that heat emissions from the outside of a dwelling is a private matter implicating the protections of the Fourth Amendment (the text of which guarantees the right of people \"to be secure in their ... houses\" against unreasonable searches and seizures (emphasis added)) is not only unprecedented but also quite difficult to take seriously. Heat waves, like aromas that are generated in a kitchen, or in a laboratory or opium den, enter the public domain if and when they leave a building. A subjective expectation that they would remain private is not only implausible but also surely not \"one that society is prepared to recognize as 'reasonable.' \" Katz, 389 U.S., at 361 (Harlan, J., concurring).~    ~    ~      27~      To be sure, the homeowner has a reasonable expectation of privacy concerning what takes place within the home, and the Fourth Amendment's protection against physical invasions of the home should apply to their functional equivalent. But the equipment in this case did not penetrate the walls of petitioner's home, and while it did pick up \"details of the home\" that were exposed to the public, ante, at 10, it did not obtain \"any information regarding the interior of the home,\" ante, at 6 (emphasis added). In the Court's own words, based on what the thermal imager \"showed\" regarding the outside of petitioner's home, the officers \"concluded\" that petitioner was engaging in illegal activity inside the home. Ante, at 2. It would be quite absurd to characterize their thought processes as \"searches,\" regardless of whether they inferred (rightly) that petitioner was growing marijuana in his house, or (wrongly) that \"the lady of the house [was taking] her daily sauna and bath.\" Ante, at 10-11. In either case, the only conclusions the officers reached concerning the interior of the home were at least as indirect as those that might have been inferred from the contents of discarded garbage, see California v. Greenwood, 486 U.S. 35 (1988), or pen register data, see Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735 (1979), or, as in this case, subpoenaed utility records, see 190 F.3d 1041, 1043 (CA9 1999). For the first time in its history, the Court assumes that an inference can amount to a Fourth Amendment violation. See ante, at 8.3~    ~    ~      28~      Notwithstanding the implications of today's decision, there is a strong public interest in avoiding constitutional litigation over the monitoring of emissions from homes, and over the inferences drawn from such monitoring. Just as \"the police cannot reasonably be expected to avert their eyes from evidence of criminal activity that could have been observed by any member of the public,\" Greenwood, 486 U.S., at 41, so too public officials should not have to avert their senses or their equipment from detecting emissions in the public domain such as excessive heat, traces of smoke, suspicious odors, odorless gases, airborne particulates, or radioactive emissions, any of which could identify hazards to the community. In my judgment, monitoring such emissions with \"sense-enhancing technology,\" ante, at 6, and drawing useful conclusions from such monitoring, is an entirely reasonable public service.~    ~    ~      29~      On the other hand, the countervailing privacy interest is at best trivial. After all, homes generally are insulated to keep heat in, rather than to prevent the detection of heat going out, and it does not seem to me that society will suffer from a rule requiring the rare homeowner who both intends to engage in uncommon activities that produce extraordinary amounts of heat, and wishes to conceal that production from outsiders, to make sure that the surrounding area is well insulated. Cf. United States v. Jacobsen, 466 U.S. 109, 122 (1984) (\"The concept of an interest in privacy that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable is, by its very nature, critically different from the mere expectation, however well justified, that certain facts will not come to the attention of the authorities\"). The interest in concealing the heat escaping from one's house pales in significance to the \"the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed,\" the \"physical entry of the home,\" United States v. United States Dist. Court for Eastern Dist. of Mich., 407 U.S. 297, 313 (1972), and it is hard to believe that it is an interest the Framers sought to protect in our Constitution.~    ~    ~      30~      Since what was involved in this case was nothing more than drawing inferences from off-the-wall surveillance, rather than any \"through-the-wall\" surveillance, the officers' conduct did not amount to a search and was perfectly reasonable.4~    ~    II~    ~      31~      Instead of trying to answer the question whether the use of the thermal imager in this case was even arguably unreasonable, the Court has fashioned a rule that is intended to provide essential guidance for the day when \"more sophisticated systems\" gain the \"ability to 'see' through walls and other opaque barriers.\" Ante, at 8, and n. 3. The newly minted rule encompasses \"obtaining [1] by sense-enhancing technology [2] any information regarding the interior of the home [3] that could not otherwise have been obtained without physical intrusion into a constitutionally protected area ... [4] at least where (as here) the technology in question is not in general public use.\" Ante, at 6-7 (internal quotation marks omitted). In my judgment, the Court's new rule is at once too broad and too narrow, and is not justified by the Court's explanation for its adoption. As I have suggested, I would not erect a constitutional impediment to the use of sense-enhancing technology unless it provides its user with the functional equivalent of actual presence in the area being searched.~    ~    ~      32~      Despite the Court's attempt to draw a line that is \"not only firm but also bright,\" ante, at 12, the contours of its new rule are uncertain because its protection apparently dissipates as soon as the relevant technology is \"in general public use,\" ante, at 6-7. Yet how much use is general public use is not even hinted at by the Court's opinion, which makes the somewhat doubtful assumption that the thermal imager used in this case does not satisfy that criterion.5 In any event, putting aside its lack of clarity, this criterion is somewhat perverse because it seems likely that the threat to privacy will grow, rather than recede, as the use of intrusive equipment becomes more readily available.~    ~    ~      33~      It is clear, however, that the category of \"sense-enhancing technology\" covered by the new rule, ante, at 6, is far too broad. It would, for example, embrace potential mechanical substitutes for dogs trained to react when they sniff narcotics. But in United States v. Place, 462 U.S. 696, 707 (1983), we held that a dog sniff that \"discloses only the presence or absence of narcotics\" does \"not constitute a 'search' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment,\" and it must follow that sense-enhancing equipment that identifies nothing but illegal activity is not a search either. Nevertheless, the use of such a device would be unconstitutional under the Court's rule, as would the use of other new devices that might detect the odor of deadly bacteria or chemicals for making a new type of high explosive, even if the devices (like the dog sniffs) are \"so limited in both the manner in which\" they obtain information and \"in the content of the information\" they reveal. Ibid. If nothing more than that sort of information could be obtained by using the devices in a public place to monitor emissions from a house, then their use would be no more objectionable than the use of the thermal imager in this case.~    ~    ~      34~      The application of the Court's new rule to \"any information regarding the interior of the home,\" ante, at 6, is also unnecessarily broad. If it takes sensitive equipment to detect an odor that identifies criminal conduct and nothing else, the fact that the odor emanates from the interior of a home should not provide it with constitutional protection. See supra, at 7-8. The criterion, moreover, is too sweeping in that information \"regarding\" the interior of a home apparently is not just information obtained through its walls, but also information concerning the outside of the building that could lead to (however many) inferences \"regarding\" what might be inside. Under that expansive view, I suppose, an officer using an infrared camera to observe a man silently entering the side door of a house at night carrying a pizza might conclude that its interior is now occupied by someone who likes pizza, and by doing so the officer would be guilty of conducting an unconstitutional \"search\" of the home.~    ~    ~      35~      Because the new rule applies to information regarding the \"interior\" of the home, it is too narrow as well as too broad. Clearly, a rule that is designed to protect individuals from the overly intrusive use of sense-enhancing equipment should not be limited to a home. If such equipment did provide its user with the functional equivalent of access to a private place-such as, for example, the telephone booth involved in Katz, or an office building-then the rule should apply to such an area as well as to a home. See Katz, 389 U.S., at 351 (\"[T]he Fourth Amendment protects people, not places\").~    ~    ~      36~      The final requirement of the Court's new rule, that the information \"could not otherwise have been obtained without physical intrusion into a constitutionally protected area,\" ante, at 6 (internal quotation marks omitted), also extends too far as the Court applies it. As noted, the Court effectively treats the mental process of analyzing data obtained from external sources as the equivalent of a physical intrusion into the home. See supra, at 4-5. As I have explained, however, the process of drawing inferences from data in the public domain should not be characterized as a search.~    ~    ~      37~      The two reasons advanced by the Court as justifications for the adoption of its new rule are both unpersuasive. First, the Court suggests that its rule is compelled by our holding in Katz, because in that case, as in this, the surveillance consisted of nothing more than the monitoring of waves emanating from a private area into the public domain. See ante, at 7-8. Yet there are critical differences between the cases. In Katz, the electronic listening device attached to the outside of the phone booth allowed the officers to pick up the content of the conversation inside the booth, making them the functional equivalent of intruders because they gathered information that was otherwise available only to someone inside the private area; it would be as if, in this case, the thermal imager presented a view of the heat-generating activity inside petitioner's home. By contrast, the thermal imager here disclosed only the relative amounts of heat radiating from the house; it would be as if, in Katz, the listening device disclosed only the relative volume of sound leaving the booth, which presumably was discernible in the public domain.6 Surely, there is a significant difference between the general and well-settled expectation that strangers will not have direct access to the contents of private communications, on the one hand, and the rather theoretical expectation that an occasional homeowner would even care if anybody noticed the relative amounts of heat emanating from the walls of his house, on the other. It is pure hyperbole for the Court to suggest that refusing to extend the holding of Katz to this case would leave the homeowner at the mercy of \"technology that could discern all human activity in the home.\" Ante, at 8.~    ~    ~      38~      Second, the Court argues that the permissibility of \"through-the-wall surveillance\" cannot depend on a distinction between observing \"intimate details\" such as \"the lady of the house [taking] her daily sauna and bath,\" and noticing only \"the nonintimate rug on the vestibule floor\" or \"objects no smaller than 36 by 36 inches.\" Ante, at 10-11. This entire argument assumes, of course, that the thermal imager in this case could or did perform \"through-the-wall surveillance\" that could identify any detail \"that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion.\" Ante, at 11-12. In fact, the device could not, see n. 1, supra, and did not, see Appendix, infra, enable its user to identify either the lady of the house, the rug on the vestibule floor, or anything else inside the house, whether smaller or larger than 36 by 36 inches. Indeed, the vague thermal images of petitioner's home that are reproduced in the Appendix were submitted by him to the District Court as part of an expert report raising the question whether the device could even take \"accurate, consistent infrared images\" of the outside of his house. Defendant's Exhibit 107, p. 4. But even if the device could reliably show extraordinary differences in the amounts of heat leaving his home, drawing the inference that there was something suspicious occurring inside the residence-a conclusion that officers far less gifted than Sherlock Holmes would readily draw-does not qualify as \"through-the-wall surveillance,\" much less a Fourth Amendment violation.~    ~    III~    ~      39~      Although the Court is properly and commendably concerned about the threats to privacy that may flow from advances in the technology available to the law enforcement profession, it has unfortunately failed to heed the tried and true counsel of judicial restraint. Instead of concentrating on the rather mundane issue that is actually presented by the case before it, the Court has endeavored to craft an all-encompassing rule for the future. It would be far wiser to give legislators an unimpeded opportunity to grapple with these emerging issues rather than to shackle them with prematurely devised constitutional constraints.~    ~    ~      40~      I respectfully dissent.~    ~    APPENDIX~    ~      41~      (Images and text reproduced from defendant's exhibit 107)~    ~    ~      42~      Top left: Infrared image of a video frame from the videotape submitted as evidence in this case. The thermogram indicates the suspect house as it appeared with the Gain and contrast in its default setting. Only the outline of the house is visible. The camera used was the Thermovision 210.~    ~    ~      43~      Top Right: Infrared image of a subsequent videoframe taken from the videotape. The gain and contrast settings have been increased in order to make the walls and roof of the structure appear hotter than what it actually is.~    ~    ~      44~      [Graphic Image omitted; see printed opinion.]~    ~    ~      45~      Bottom Right: The same image, but with the gain and contrast increased. This change in camera settings cause any object to appear hotter than what it actually is. The arrow indicates the overloading of a area immediately around a hot object in this case the electrical transformer and the streetlight. This overloading of the image is a inherent design flaw in the camera itself.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         After an evidentiary hearing, the District Court found: \"[T]he use of the thermal imaging device here was not an intrusion into Kyllo's home. No intimate details of the home were observed, and there was no intrusion upon the privacy of the individuals within the home. The device used cannot penetrate walls or windows to reveal conversations or human activities. The device recorded only the heat being emitted from the home.\" Supp. App. to Pet. for Cert. 40.~      ~      ~        2~         Thus, for example, we have found consistent with the Fourth Amendment, even absent a warrant, the search and seizure of garbage left for collection outside the curtilage of a home, California v. Greenwood, 486 U.S. 35 (1988); the aerial surveillance of a fenced-in backyard from an altitude of 1,000 feet, California v. Ciraolo, 476 U.S. 207 (1986); the aerial observation of a partially exposed interior of a residential greenhouse from 400 feet above, Florida v. Riley, 488 U.S. 445 (1989); the aerial photography of an industrial complex from several thousand feet above, Dow Chemical Co. v. United States, 476 U.S. 227 (1986); and the observation of smoke emanating from chimney stacks, Air Pollution Variance Bd. of Colo. v. Western Alfalfa Corp., 416 U.S. 861 (1974).~      ~      ~        3~         Although the Court credits us with the \"novel proposition that inference insulates a search,\" ante, at 9, our point simply is that an inference cannot be a search, contrary to the Court's reasoning. See supra, at 4-5. Thus, the Court's use of United States v. Karo, 468 U.S. 705 (1984), to refute a point we do not make underscores the fact that the Court has no real answer (either in logic or in law) to the point we do make. Of course, Karo itself does not provide any support for the Court's view that inferences can amount to unconstitutional searches. The illegality in that case was \"the monitoring of a beeper in a private residence\" to obtain information that \"could not have been obtained by observation from outside,\" id., at 714-715, rather than any thought processes that flowed from such monitoring.~      ~      ~        4~         This view comports with that of all the Courts of Appeals that have resolved the issue. See 190 F.3d 1041 (CA9 1999); United States v. Robinson, 62 F.3d 1325 (CA11 1995) (upholding warrantless use of thermal imager); United States v. Myers, 46 F.3d 668 (CA7 1995) (same); United States v. Ishmael, 48 F.3d 850 (CA5 1995) (same); United States v. Pinson, 24 F.3d 1056 (CA8 1994) (same). But see United States v. Cusumano, 67 F.3d 1497 (CA10 1995) (warrantless use of thermal imager violated Fourth Amendment), vacated and decided on other grounds, 83 F.3d 1247 (CA10 1996) (en banc).~      ~      ~        5~         The record describes a device that numbers close to a thousand manufactured units; that has a predecessor numbering in the neighborhood of 4,000 to 5,000 units; that competes with a similar product numbering from 5,000 to 6,000 units; and that is \"readily available to the public\" for commercial, personal, or law enforcement purposes, and is just an 800-number away from being rented from \"half a dozen national companies\" by anyone who wants one. App. 18. Since, by virtue of the Court's new rule, the issue is one of first impression, perhaps it should order an evidentiary hearing to determine whether these facts suffice to establish \"general public use.\"~      ~      ~        6~         The use of the latter device would be constitutional given Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 741 (1979), which upheld the use of pen registers to record numbers dialed on a phone because, unlike \"the listening device employed in Katz ... pen registers do not acquire the contents of communications.\"~      ~    ~    ",

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.TUAN ANH NGUYEN and JOSEPH BOULAIS, PETITIONERSv.IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICESUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    No. 99-2071.~    Argued January 9, 2001Decided June 11, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      Petitioner Tuan Anh Nguyen was born out of wedlock in Vietnam to a Vietnamese citizen and copetitioner Joseph Boulais, a United States citizen. Nguyen became a lawful permanent United States resident at age six and was raised by Boulais. At age 22, Nguyen pleaded guilty in a Texas state court to two counts of sexual assault on a child. Subsequently, respondent Immigration and Naturalization Service initiated deportation proceedings against him based on his serious criminal offenses. The Immigration Judge ordered him deportable. Boulais obtained an order of parentage from a state court while Nguyen's appeal was pending before the Board of Immigration Appeals, but the Board dismissed the appeal, rejecting Nguyen's citizenship claim because he had not complied with 8 U.S.C.  1409(a)'s requirements for one born out of wedlock and abroad to a citizen father and a noncitizen mother. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit rejected petitioners' claim that 1409 violates equal protection by providing different citizenship rules for children born abroad and out of wedlock depending on whether the citizen parent is the mother or the father.~      Held: Section 1409 is consistent with the equal protection guarantee embedded in the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Pp. 3-18.~      (a) A child born abroad and out of wedlock acquires at birth the nationality status of a citizen mother who meets a specified residency requirement. 1409(c). However, when the father is the citizen parent, inter alia, one of three affirmative steps must be taken before the child turns 18: legitimization, a declaration of paternity under oath by the father, or a court order of paternity. 1409(a)(4). The failure to satisfy this section renders Nguyen ineligible for citizenship. Pp. 3-5.~      (b) A gender-based classification withstands equal protection scrutiny if it serves important governmental objectives and the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives. United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533. Congress' decision to impose different requirements on unmarried fathers and unmarried mothers is based on the significant difference between their respective relationships to the potential citizen at the time of birth and is justified by two important governmental interests. Pp. 5-16.~      (1) The first such interest is the importance of assuring that a biological parent-child relationship exists. The mother's relation is verifiable from the birth itself and is documented by the birth certificate or hospital records and the witnesses to the birth. However, a father need not be present at the birth, and his presence is not incontrovertible proof of fatherhood. See Lehr v. Robertson, 463 U.S. 248, 260, n. 16. Because fathers and mothers are not similarly situated with regard to proof of biological parenthood, the imposition of different rules for each is neither surprising nor troublesome from a constitutional perspective. Section 1409(a)(4)'s provision of three options is designed to ensure acceptable documentation of paternity. Petitioners argue that 1409(a)(1)'s requirement that a father provide clear and convincing evidence of parentage is sufficient to achieve the end of establishing paternity, given the sophistication of modern DNA tests. However, that section does not mandate DNA testing. Moreover, the Constitution does not require that Congress elect one particular mechanism from among many possible methods of establishing paternity, and 1409(a)(4) represents a reasonable legislative conclusion that the satisfaction of one of several alternatives will suffice to establish the father-child blood link required as a predicate to the child's acquisition of citizenship. Finally, even a facially neutral rule would sometimes require fathers to take additional affirmative steps which would not be required of mothers, whose names will be on the birth certificate as a result of their presence at the birth, and who will have the benefit of witnesses to the birth to call upon. Pp. 7-9.~      (2) The second governmental interest furthered by 1409(a)(4) is the determination to ensure that the child and citizen parent have some demonstrated opportunity to develop a relationship that consists of real, everyday ties providing a connection between child and citizen parent and, in turn, the United States. Such an opportunity inheres in the event of birth in the case of a citizen mother and her child, but does not result as a matter of biological inevitability in the case of an unwed father. He may not know that a child was conceived, and a mother may be unsure of the father's identity. One concern in this context has always been with young men on duty with the Armed Forces in foreign countries. Today, the ease of travel and willingness of Americans to visit foreign countries have resulted in numbers of trips abroad that must be of real concern when contemplating the prospect of mandating, contrary to Congress' wishes, citizenship by male parentage subject to no condition other than the father's residence in this country. Equal protection principles do not require Congress to ignore this reality. Section 1409 takes the unremarkable step of ensuring that the opportunity inherent in the event of birth as to the mother-child relationship exists between father and child before citizenship is conferred upon the latter. That interest's importance is too profound to be satisfied by a DNA test because scientific proof of biological paternity does not, by itself, ensure father-child contact during the child's minority. Congress is well within its authority in refusing, absent proof of an opportunity for a relationship to develop, to commit this country to embracing a child as a citizen. Contrary to petitioners' argument, 1409 does not embody a gender-based stereotype. There is nothing irrational or improper in recognizing that at the moment of birth-a critical event in the statutory scheme and tradition of citizenship law-the mother's knowledge of the child and the fact of parenthood have been established in a way not guaranteed to the unwed father. Pp. 9-13.~      (3) The means Congress chose substantially relate to its interest in facilitating a parent-child relationship. First, various statutory provisions, in addition to 1409(a), require that some act linking a child to the United States occur before the child turns 18. Second, petitioners' argument that 1409(a)(4) reflects a stereotype that women are more likely than men to actually establish the required relationship misconceives both the governmental interest's nature and the equal protection inquiry. As to the former, Congress could have chosen to advance the interest of ensuring a meaningful relationship in every case, but it enacted instead an easily administered scheme to promote the different but still substantial interest of ensuring an opportunity for that relationship to develop. Petitioners' argument confuses the equal protection inquiry's means and ends; 1409(a)(4) should not be invalidated because Congress elected to advance an interest that is less demanding to satisfy than some alternative. Even if one conceives of Congress' real interest as the establishment of a meaningful relationship, it is almost axiomatic that a policy seeking to foster the opportunity for meaningful parent-child bonds to develop has a close and substantial bearing on the governmental interest in that bond's formation. Here, Congress' means are in substantial furtherance of an important governmental objective, and the fit between the means and that end is exceedingly persuasive. See Virginia, supra, at 533. Pp. 13-16.~      (c) Section 1409(a)(4) imposes a minimal obligation. Only the least onerous of its three options must be satisfied; and it can be satisfied on the day of birth, or the next day, or for the next 18 years. Section 1409(a), moreover, is not the sole means of attaining citizenship for the child, who can seek citizenship in his or her own right, rather than via reliance on parental ties. P. 16.~      (d) Because the statute satisfies the equal protection scrutiny applied to gender-based qualifications, this Court need not consider whether it can confer citizenship on terms other than those specified by Congress or assess the implications of statements in earlier cases regarding the wide deference afforded to Congress in exercising its immigration and naturalization power. Pp. 17-18.~      208 F.3d 528, affirmed.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT~      Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and Stevens, Scalia, and Thomas, JJ., joined.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      This case presents a question not resolved by a majority of the Court in a case before us three Terms ago. See Miller v. Albright, 523 U.S. 420 (1998). Title 8 U.S.C.  1409 governs the acquisition of United States citizenship by persons born to one United States citizen parent and one noncitizen parent when the parents are unmarried and the child is born outside of the United States or its possessions. The statute imposes different requirements for the child's acquisition of citizenship depending upon whether the citizen parent is the mother or the father. The question before us is whether the statutory distinction is consistent with the equal protection guarantee embedded in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.~    ~    ~      2~      * Petitioner Tuan Ahn Nguyen was born in Saigon, Vietnam, on September 11, 1969, to copetitioner Joseph Boulais and a Vietnamese citizen. Boulais and Nguyen's mother were not married. Boulais always has been a citizen of the United States, and he was in Vietnam under the employ of a corporation. After he and Nguyen's mother ended their relationship, Nguyen lived for a time with the family of Boulais' new Vietnamese girlfriend. In June 1975, Nguyen, then almost six years of age, came to the United States. He became a lawful permanent resident and was raised in Texas by Boulais.~    ~    ~      3~      In 1992, when Nguyen was 22, he pleaded guilty in a Texas state court to two counts of sexual assault on a child. He was sentenced to eight years in prison on each count. Three years later, the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) initiated deportation proceedings against Nguyen as an alien who had been convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude, as well as an aggravated felony. See 8 U.S.C.  1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii) (1994 ed., Supp. IV). Though later he would change his position and argue he was a United States citizen, Nguyen testified at his deportation hearing that he was a citizen of Vietnam. The Immigration Judge found him deportable.~    ~    ~      4~      Nguyen appealed to the Board of Immigration of Appeals and, in 1998, while the matter was pending, his father obtained an order of parentage from a state court, based on DNA testing. By this time, Nguyen was 28 years old. The Board dismissed Nguyen's appeal, rejecting his claim to United States citizenship because he had failed to establish compliance with 8 U.S.C.  1409(a), which sets forth the requirements for one who was born out of wedlock and abroad to a citizen father and a noncitizen mother.~    ~    ~      5~      Nguyen and Boulais appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, arguing that 1409 violates equal protection by providing different rules for attainment of citizenship by children born abroad and out of wedlock depending upon whether the one parent with American citizenship is the mother or the father. The court rejected the constitutional challenge to 1409(a). 208 F.3d 528, 535 (2000).~    ~    ~      6~      The constitutionality of the distinction between unwed fathers and mothers was argued in Miller, but a major- ity of the Court did not resolve the issue. Four Justices, in two different opinions, rejected the challenge to the gender-based distinction, two finding the statute consistent with the Fifth Amendment, see 523 U.S., at 423 (opinion of Stevens, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J.), and two concluding that the court could not confer citizenship as a remedy even if the statute violated equal protection, see id., at 452 (Scalia, J., joined by Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). Three Justices reached a contrary result, and would have found the statue violative of equal protection. Id., at 460 (Ginsburg J., joined by Souter and Breyer, JJ., dissenting); id. at 471 (Breyer, J., joined by Souter and Ginsburg, JJ., dissenting). Finally, two Justices did not reach the issue as to the father, having determined that the child, the only petitioner in Miller, lacked standing to raise the equal protection rights of his father. Id., at 445 (O'Connor, J., joined by Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).~    ~    ~      7~      Since Miller, the Courts of Appeal have divided over the constitutionality of 1409. Compare 208 F.3d 528 (CA5 2000) (case below), with Lake v. Reno, 226 F.3d 141 (CA2 2000), and United States v. Ahumada-Aguilar, 189 F.3d 1121 (CA9 1999). We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. 530 U.S. 1305 (2000). The father is before the Court in this case; and, as all agree he has standing to raise the constitutional claim, we now resolve it. We hold that 1409(a) is consistent with the constitutional guarantee of equal protection.~    ~    II~    ~      8~      The general requirement for acquisition of citizenship by a child born outside the United States and its outlying possessions and to parents who are married, one of whom is a citizen and the other of whom is an alien, is set forth in 8 U.S.C.  1401(g). The statute provides that the child is also a citizen if, before the birth, the citizen parent had been physically present in the United States for a total of five years, at least two of which were after the parent turned 14 years of age.~    ~    ~      9~      As to an individual born under the same circumstances, save that the parents are unwed, 1409(a) sets forth the following requirements where the father is the citizen parent and the mother is an alien:~    ~    ~      10~      \"(1) a blood relationship between the person and the father is established by clear and convincing evidence,~    ~    ~      11~      \"(2) the father had the nationality of the United States at the time of the person's birth,~    ~    ~      12~      \"(3) the father (unless deceased) has agreed in writing to provide financial support for the person until the person reaches the age of 18 years, and~    ~    ~      13~      \"(4) while the person is under the age of 18 years-~    ~    ~      14~      \"(A) the person is legitimated under the law of the person's residence or domicile,~    ~    ~      15~      \"(B) the father acknowledges paternity of the person in writing under oath, or~    ~    ~      16~      \"(C) the paternity of the person is established by adjudication of a competent court.\" In addition, 1409(a) incorporates by reference, as to the citizen parent, the residency requirement of 1401(g).~    ~    ~      17~      When the citizen parent of the child born abroad and out of wedlock is the child's mother, the requirements for the transmittal of citizenship are described in 1409(c): \"(c) Notwithstanding the provision of subsection (a) of this section, a person born, after December 23, 1952, outside the United States and out of wedlock shall be held to have acquired at birth the nationality status of his mother, if the mother had the nationality of the United States at the time of such person's birth, and if the mother had previously been physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for a continuous period of one year.\"~    ~    ~      18~      Section 1409(a) thus imposes a set of requirements on the children of citizen fathers born abroad and out of wedlock to a noncitizen mother that are not imposed under like circumstances when the citizen parent is the mother. All concede the requirements of 1409(a)(3) and (a)(4), relating to a citizen father's acknowledgment of a child while he is under 18, were not satisfied in this case. We need not discuss 1409(a)(3), however. It was added in 1986, after Nguyen's birth; and Nguyen falls within a transitional rule which allows him to elect application of either the current version of the statute, or the pre-1986 version, which contained no parallel to 1409(a)(3). See Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1986, 100 Stat. 3655; note following 8 U.S.C.  1409; Miller, supra, at 426, n. 3, 432 (opinion of Stevens, J.). And in any event, our ruling respecting 1409(a)(4) is dispositive of the case. As an individual seeking citizenship under 1409(a) must meet all of its preconditions, the failure to satisfy 1409(a)(4) renders Nguyen ineligible for citize ship.~    ~    III~    ~      19~      For a gender-based classification to withstand equal protection scrutiny, it must be established \" 'at least that the [challenged] classification serves \"important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed\" are \"substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.\" ' \" United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996) (quoting Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 724 (1982) in turn quoting Wengler v. Druggists Mut. Ins. Co., 446 U.S. 142, 150 (1980)). For reasons to follow, we conclude 1409 satisfies this standard. Given that determination, we need not decide whether some lesser degree of scrutiny pertains because the statute implicates Congress' immigration and naturalization power. See Miller, 523 U.S., at 434, n. 11 (explaining that the statute must be subjected to a standard more deferential to the congressional exercise of the immigration and naturalization power, but that \"[e]ven if ... the heightened scrutiny that normally governs gender discrimination claims applied in this context,\" the statute would be sustained (citations omitted)).~    ~    ~      20~      Before considering the important governmental interests advanced by the statute, two observations concerning the operation of the provision are in order. First, a citizen mother expecting a child and living abroad has the right to re-enter the United States so the child can be born here and be a 14th Amendment citizen. From one perspective, then, the statute simply ensures equivalence between two expectant mothers who are citizens abroad if one chooses to reenter for the child's birth and the other chooses not to return, or does not have the means to do so. This equivalence is not a factor if the single citizen parent living abroad is the father. For, unlike the unmarried mother, the unmarried father as a general rule cannot control where the child will be born.~    ~    ~      21~      Second, although 1409(a)(4) requires certain conduct to occur before the child of a citizen father, born out of wedlock and abroad, reaches 18 years of age, it imposes no limitations on when an individual who qualifies under the statute can claim citizenship. The statutory treatment of citizenship is identical in this respect whether the citizen parent is the mother or the father. A person born to a citizen parent of either gender may assert citizenship, assuming compliance with statutory preconditions, regardless of his or her age. And while the conditions necessary for a citizen mother to transmit citizenship under 1409(c) exist at birth, citizen fathers and/or their children have 18 years to satisfy the requirements of 1409(a)(4). See Miller, supra, at 435 (opinion of Stevens, J.).~    ~    ~      22~      The statutory distinction relevant in this case, then, is that 1409(a)(4) requires one of three affirmative steps to be taken if the citizen parent is the father, but not if the citizen parent is the mother: legitimation; a declaration of paternity under oath by the father; or a court order of paternity. Congress' decision to impose requirements on unmarried fathers that differ from those on unmarried mothers is based on the significant difference between their respective relationships to the potential citizen at the time of birth. Specifically, the imposition of the requirement for a paternal relationship, but not a maternal one, is justified by two important governmental objectives. We discuss each in turn.~    ~    ~      23~      * The first governmental interest to be served is the importance of assuring that a biological parent-child relationship exists. In the case of the mother, the relation is verifiable from the birth itself. The mother's status is documented in most instances by the birth certificate or hospital records and the witnesses who attest to her having given birth.~    ~    ~      24~      In the case of the father, the uncontestable fact is that he need not be present at the birth. If he is present, furthermore, that circumstance is not incontrovertible proof of fatherhood. See Lehr v. Robertson, 463 U.S. 248, 260, n. 16 (1983) (\" ' The mother carries and bears the child, and in this sense her parental relationship is clear. The validity of the father's parental claims must be gauged by other measures' \" (quoting Caban v. Mohammed, 441 U.S. 380, 397 (1979) (Stewart, J., dissenting))); Trimble v. Gordon, 430 U.S. 762, 770 (1977) (\"The more serious problems of proving paternity might justify a more demanding standard for illegitimate children claiming under their fathers' estates than that required ... under their mothers' estates ...\"). Fathers and mothers are not similarly situated with regard to the proof of biological parenthood. The imposition of a different set of rules for making that legal determination with respect to fathers and mothers is neither surprising nor troublesome from a constitutional perspective. Cf. Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985) (explaining that the Equal Protection Clause \"is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike\"); F. S. Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, 253 U.S. 412, 415 (1920). Section 1409(a)(4)'s provision of three options for a father seeking to establish paternity-legitimation, paternity oath, and court order of paternity-is designed to ensure an acceptable documentation of paternity.~    ~    ~      25~      Petitioners argue that the requirement of 1409(a)(1), that a father provide clear and convincing evidence of parentage, is sufficient to achieve the end of establishing paternity, given the sophistication of modern DNA tests. Brief for Petitioners 21-24. Section 1409(a)(1) does not actually mandate a DNA test, however. The Constitution, moreover, does not require that Congress elect one particular mechanism from among many possible methods of establishing paternity, even if that mechanism arguably might be the most scientifically advanced method. With respect to DNA testing, the expense, reliability, and availability of such testing in various parts of the world may have been of particular concern to Congress. See Miller, supra, at 437 (opinion of Stevens, J.). The requirement of 1409(a)(4) represents a reasonable conclusion by the legislature that the satisfaction of one of several alternatives will suffice to establish the blood link between father and child required as a predicate to the child's acquisition of citizenship. Cf. Lehr, supra, at 267-268 (upholding New York statutory requirement that gave mothers of children born out of wedlock notice of an adoption hearing, but only extended that right to fathers who mailed a postcard to a \"putative fathers registry\"). Given the proof of motherhood that is inherent in birth itself, it is unremarkable that Congress did not require the same affirmative steps of mothers.~    ~    ~      26~      Finally, to require Congress to speak without reference to the gender of the parent with regard to its objective of ensuring a blood tie between parent and child would be to insist on a hollow neutrality. As Justice Stevens pointed out in Miller, Congress could have required both mothers and fathers to prove parenthood within 30 days or, for that matter, 18 years, of the child's birth. 523 U.S., at 436. Given that the mother is always present at birth, but that the father need not be, the facially neutral rule would sometimes require fathers to take additional affirmative steps which would not be required of mothers, whose names will appear on the birth certificate as a result of their presence at the birth, and who will have the benefit of witnesses to the birth to call upon. The issue is not the use of gender specific terms instead of neutral ones. Just as neutral terms can mask discrimination that is unlawful, gender specific terms can mark a permissible distinction. The equal protection question is whether the distinction is lawful. Here, the use of gender specific terms takes into account a biological difference between the parents. The differential treatment is inherent in a sensible statutory scheme, given the unique relationship of the mother to the event of birth.~    ~    B~    ~      27~      * The second important governmental interest furthered in a substantial manner by 1409(a)(4) is the determination to ensure that the child and the citizen parent have some demonstrated opportunity or potential to develop not just a relationship that is recognized, as a formal matter, by the law, but one that consists of the real, everyday ties that provide a connection between child and citizen par- ent and, in turn, the United States. See id., at 438-440 (opinion of Stevens, J.). In the case of a citizen mother and a child born overseas, the opportunity for a meaningful relationship between citizen parent and child inheres in the very event of birth, an event so often critical to our constitutional and statutory understandings of citizenship. The mother knows that the child is in being and is hers and has an initial point of contact with him. There is at least an opportunity for mother and child to develop a real, meaningful relationship.~    ~    ~      28~      The same opportunity does not result from the event of birth, as a matter of biological inevitability, in the case of the unwed father. Given the 9-month interval between conception and birth, it is not always certain that a father will know that a child was conceived, nor is it always clear that even the mother will be sure of the father's identity. This fact takes on particular significance in the case of a child born overseas and out of wedlock. One concern in this context has always been with young people, men for the most part, who are on duty with the Armed Forces in foreign countries. See Department of Defense, Selected Manpower Statistics 48, 74 (1999) (reporting that in 1969, the year in which Nguyen was born, there were 3,458,072 active duty military personnel, 39,506 of whom were female); Department of Defense, Selected Manpower Statistics 29 (1970) (noting that 1,041,094 military personnel were stationed in foreign countries in 1969); Department of Defense, Selected Manpower Statistics 49, 76 (1999) (reporting that in 1999 there were 1,385,703 active duty military personnel, 200,287 of whom were female); id., at 33 (noting that 252,763 military personnel were stationed in foreign countries in 1999).~    ~    ~      29~      When we turn to the conditions which prevail today, we find that the passage of time has produced additional and even more substantial grounds to justify the statutory distinction. The ease of travel and the willingness of Americans to visit foreign countries have resulted in numbers of trips abroad that must be of real concern when we contemplate the prospect of accepting petitioners' argument, which would mandate, contrary to Congress' wishes, citizenship by male parentage subject to no condition save the father's previous length of residence in this country. In 1999 alone, Americans made almost 25 million trips abroad, excluding trips to Canada and Mexico. See U.S. Dep t. of Commerce, 1999 Profile of U.S. Travelers to Overseas Destinations 1 (Oct. 2000). Visits to Canada and Mexico add to this figure almost 34 million additional visits. See U.S. Dep t. of Commerce, U.S. Resident Travel to Overseas Countries, Historical Visitation 1989-1999, p. 1 (Oct. 2000). And the average American overseas traveler spent 15.1 nights out of the United States in 1999. 1999 Profile of U.S. Travelers to Overseas Destinations, supra, at 4.~    ~    ~      30~      Principles of equal protection do not require Congress to ignore this reality. To the contrary, these facts demonstrate the critical importance of the Government's interest in ensuring some opportunity for a tie between citizen father and foreign born child which is a reasonable substitute for the opportunity manifest between mother and child at the time of birth. Indeed, especially in light of the number of Americans who take short sojourns abroad, the prospect that a father might not even know of the conception is a realistic possibility. See Miller, supra, at 439 (opinion of Stevens, J.). Even if a father knows of the fact of conception, moreover, it does not follow that he will be present at the birth of the child. Thus, unlike the case of the mother, there is no assurance that the father and his biological child will ever meet. Without an initial point of contact with the child by a father who knows the child is his own, there is no opportunity for father and child to begin a relationship. Section 1409 takes the unremarkable step of ensuring that such an opportunity, inherent in the event of birth as to the mother-child relationship, exists between father and child before citizenship is conferred upon the latter.~    ~    ~      31~      The importance of the governmental interest at issue here is too profound to be satisfied merely by conducting a DNA test. The fact of paternity can be established even without the father's knowledge, not to say his presence. Paternity can be established by taking DNA samples even from a few strands of hair, years after the birth. See Federal Judicial Center, Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence 497 (2d ed. 2000). Yet scientific proof of biological paternity does nothing, by itself, to ensure contact between father and child during the child's minority.~    ~    ~      32~      Congress is well within its authority in refusing, absent proof of at least the opportunity for the development of a relationship between citizen parent and child, to commit this country to embracing a child as a citizen entitled as of birth to the full protection of the United States, to the absolute right to enter its borders, and to full participation in the political process. If citizenship is to be conferred by the unwitting means petitioners urge, so that its acquisition abroad bears little relation to the realities of the child's own ties and allegiances, it is for Congress, not this Court, to make that determination. Congress has not taken that path but has instead chosen, by means of 1409, to ensure in the case of father and child the opportunity for a relationship to develop, an opportunity which the event of birth itself provides for the mother and child. It should be unobjectionable for Congress to require some evidence of a minimal opportunity for the development of a relationship with the child in terms the male can fulfill.~    ~    ~      33~      While the INS' brief contains statements indicating the governmental interest we here describe, see Brief for Respondent 38, 41, it suggests other interests as well. Statements from the government's brief are not conclusive as to the objects of the statute, however, as we are concerned with the objectives of Congress, not those of the INS. We ascertain the purpose of a statute by drawing logical conclusions from its text, structure, and operation.~    ~    ~      34~      Petitioners and their amici argue in addition that, rather than fulfilling an important governmental interest, 1409 merely embodies a gender-based stereotype. Although the above discussion should illustrate that, contrary to petitioners' assertions, 1409 addresses an undeniable difference in the circumstance of the parents at the time a child is born, it should be noted, furthermore, that the difference does not result from some stereotype, defined as a frame of mind resulting from irrational or uncritical analysis. There is nothing irrational or improper in the recognition that at the moment of birth-a critical event in the statutory scheme and in the whole tradition of citizenship law-the mother's knowledge of the child and the fact of parenthood have been established in a way not guaranteed in the case of the unwed father. This is not a stereotype. See Virginia, 518 U.S., at 533 (\"The heightened review standard our precedent establishes does not make sex a proscribed classification... . Physical differences between men and women ... are enduring\").~    ~    2~    ~      35~      Having concluded that facilitation of a relationship between parent and child is an important governmental interest, the question remains whether the means Congress chose to further its objective-the imposition of certain additional requirements upon an unwed father-substantially relate to that end. Under this test, the means Congress adopted must be sustained.~    ~    ~      36~      First, it should be unsurprising that Congress decided to require that an opportunity for a parent-child relationship occur during the formative years of the child's minority. In furtherance of the desire to ensure some tie between this country and one who seeks citizenship, various other statutory provisions concerning citizenship and naturalization require some act linking the child to the United States to occur before the child reaches 18 years of age. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C.  1431 (child born abroad to one citizen parent and one noncitizen parent shall become a citizen if, inter alia, the noncitizen parent is naturalized before the child reaches 18 years of age and the child begins to reside in the United States before he or she turns 18); 1432 (imposing same conditions in the case of a child born abroad to two alien parents who are naturalized).~    ~    ~      37~      Second, petitioners argue that 1409(a)(4) is not effective. In particular, petitioners assert that, although a mother will know of her child's birth, \"knowledge that one is a parent, no matter how it is acquired, does not guarantee a relationship with one's child.\" Brief for Petitioners 16. They thus maintain that the imposition of the additional requirements of 1409(a)(4) only on the children of citizen fathers must reflect a stereotype that women are more likely than men to actually establish a relationship with their children. Id., at 17.~    ~    ~      38~      This line of argument misconceives the nature of both the governmental interest at issue and the manner in which we examine statutes alleged to violate equal protection. As to the former, Congress would of course be entitled to advance the interest of ensuring an actual, meaningful relationship in every case before citizenship is conferred. Or Congress could excuse compliance with the formal requirements when an actual father-child relationship is proved. It did neither here, perhaps because of the subjectivity, intrusiveness, and difficulties of proof that might attend an inquiry into any particular bond or tie. Instead, Congress enacted an easily administered scheme to promote the different but still substantial interest of ensuring at least an opportunity for a parent-child relationship to develop. Petitioners' argument confuses the means and ends of the equal protection inquiry; 1409(a)(4) should not be invalidated because Congress elected to advance an interest that is less demanding to satisfy than some other alternative.~    ~    ~      39~      Even if one conceives of the interest Congress pursues as the establishment of a real, practical relationship of considerable substance between parent and child in every case, as opposed simply to ensuring the potential for the relationship to begin, petitioners' misconception of the nature of the equal protection inquiry is fatal to their argument. A statute meets the equal protection standard we here apply so long as it is \" ' \"substantially related to the achievement of \" ' \" the governmental objective in question. Virginia, supra, at 533 (quoting Hogan, 458 U.S., at 724 (in turn quoting Wengler, 446 U.S., at 150)). It is almost axiomatic that a policy which seeks to foster the opportunity for meaningful parent-child bonds to develop has a close and substantial bearing on the governmental interest in the actual formation of that bond. None of our gender-based classification equal protection cases have required that the statute under consideration must be capable of achieving its ultimate objective in every in stance.~    ~    ~      40~      In this difficult context of conferring citizenship on vast numbers of persons, the means adopted by Congress are in substantial furtherance of important governmental objectives. The fit between the means and the important end is \"exceedingly persuasive.\" See Virginia, 518 U.S., at 533. We have explained that an \"exceedingly persuasive justification\" is established \"by showing at least that the classification serves 'important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed' are 'substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.' \" Hogan, supra, at 724 (citations omitted). Section 1409 meets this standard.~    ~    C~    ~      41~      In analyzing 1409(a)(4), we are mindful that the obligation it imposes with respect to the acquisition of citizenship by the child of a citizen father is minimal. This circumstance shows that Congress has not erected inordinate and unnecessary hurdles to the conferral of citizenship on the children of citizen fathers in furthering its important objectives. Only the least onerous of the three options provided for in 1409(a)(4) must be satisfied. If the~    ~    ~      42~      child has been legitimated under the law of the relevant jurisdiction, that will be the end of the matter. See 1409(a)(4)(A). In the alternative, a father who has not legitimated his child by formal means need only make a written acknowledgement of paternity under oath in order to transmit citizenship to his child, hardly a substantial burden. See 1409(a)(4)(B). Or, the father could choose to obtain a court order of paternity. See 1409(a)(4)(C). The statute can be satisfied on the day of birth, or the next day, or for the next 18 years. In this case, the unfortunate, even tragic, circumstance is that Boulais did not pursue, or perhaps did not know of, these simple steps and alternatives. Any omission, however, does not nullify the statutory scheme.~    ~    ~      43~      Section 1409(a), moreover, is not the sole means by which the child of a citizen father can attain citizenship. An individual who fails to comply with 1409(a), but who has substantial ties to the United States, can seek citizenship in his or her own right, rather than via reliance on ties to a citizen parent. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C.  1423 1427. This option now may be foreclosed to Nguyen, but any bar is due to the serious nature of his criminal offenses not to an equal protection denial or to any supposed rigidity or harshness in the citizenship laws.~    ~    IV~    ~      44~      The statutory scheme's satisfaction of the equal protection scrutiny we apply to gender-based classifications constitutes a sufficient basis for upholding it. It should be noted, however, that, even were we to conclude that the statute did not meet this standard of review, petitioners would face additional obstacles before they could prevail.~    ~    ~      45~      The INS urges that, irrespective of whether 1409(a) is constitutional, the Court cannot grant the relief petitioners request: the conferral of citizenship on terms other than those specified by Congress. There may well be \"potential problems with fashioning a remedy\" were we to find the statute unconstitutional. See Miller, 523 U.S.,~    ~    ~      46~      at 451 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); cf. id., at 445, n. 26 (opinion of Stevens, J.) (declining to address the question whether the Court could confer the sought-after remedy). Two Members of today's majority said in Miller that this argument was dispositive. See id., at 452-459 (Scalia, J., joined by Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). Petitioners ask us to invalidate and sever 1409(a)(3) and (a)(4), but it must be remembered that severance is based on the assumption that Congress would have intended the result. See id., at 457 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (citing New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992)). In this regard, it is significant that, although the Immigration and Nationality Act contains a general severability provision, Congress expressly provided with respect to the very subchapter of the United States Code at issue and in a provision entitled \"Sole procedure,\" that \"[a] person may only be naturalized as a citizen of the United States in the manner and under the conditions prescribed in this subchapter and not otherwise.\" 8 U.S.C.  1421(d); see also Miller, supra, at 457-458 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). Section 1421(d) refers to naturalization, which in turn is defined as \"conferring of nationality of a state upon a person after birth.\" 8 U.S.C.  1101(a)(23). Citizenship under section 1409(a) is retroactive to the date of birth, but it is a naturalization under section 1421(d) nevertheless. The conditions specified by section 1409(a) for conferral of citizenship, as a matter of definition, must take place after the child is born, in some instances taking as long as 18 years. Section 1409(a), then, is subject to the limitation imposed by 1421(d).~    ~    ~      47~      In light of our holding that there is no equal protection violation, we need not rely on this argument. For the same reason, we need not assess the implications of statements in our earlier cases regarding the wide deference afforded to Congress in the exercise of its immigration and naturalization power. See, e.g., Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787, 792-793, and n. 4 (1977) (quoting Galvan v. Press, 347 U.S. 522, 531 (1954)); 430 U.S., at 792 (quoting Oceanic Steam Nav. Co. v. Stranahan, 214 U.S. 320, 339 (1909)). These arguments would have to be considered, however, were it to be determined that 1409 did not withstand conventional equal protection scrutiny.~    ~    V~    ~      48~      To fail to acknowledge even our most basic biological differences-such as the fact that a mother must be present at birth but the father need not be-risks making the guarantee of equal protection superficial, and so disserving it. Mechanistic classification of all our differences as stereotypes would operate to obscure those misconceptions and prejudices that are real. The distinction embodied in the statutory scheme here at issue is not marked by misconception and prejudice, nor does it show disrespect for either class. The difference between men and women in relation to the birth process is a real one, and the principle of equal protection does not forbid Congress to address the problem at hand in a manner specific to each gender.~    ~    ~      49~      The judgment of the Court of Appeals is Affirmed.~    ~    ~      50~      Scalia, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Thomas, J., joined.~    ~    ~      51~      O'Connor, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.~    ~    ~      52~      Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring.~    ~    ~      53~      I remain of the view that the Court lacks power to provide relief of the sort requested in this suit-namely, conferral of citizenship on a basis other than that prescribed by Congress. See Miller v. Albright, 523 U.S. 420, 452 (1998) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). A majority of the Justices in Miller having concluded otherwise, see id., at 423 (opinion of Stevens, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J.); id., at 460 (Ginsburg, J., joined by Souter and Breyer, JJ., dissenting); id., at 471 (Breyer, J., joined by Souter and Ginsburg, JJ., dissenting); and a majority of the Court today proceeding on the same assumption; I think it appropriate for me to reach the merits of petitioners' equal protection claims. I join the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      54~      Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.~    ~    ~      55~      In a long line of cases spanning nearly three decades, this Court has applied heightened scrutiny to legislative classifications based on sex. The Court today confronts another statute that classifies individuals on the basis of their sex. While the Court invokes heightened scrutiny, the manner in which it explains and applies this standard is a stranger to our precedents. Because the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) has not shown an exceedingly persuasive justification for the sex-based classification embodied in 8 U.S.C.  1409(a)(4)-i.e., because it has failed to establish at least that the classification substantially relates to the achievement of important governmental objectives-I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.~    ~    ~      56~      * Sex-based statutes, even when accurately reflecting the way most men or women behave, deny individuals opportunity. Such generalizations must be viewed not in isolation, but in the context of our Nation's \" 'long and unfortunate history of sex discrimination.' \" J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B., 511 U.S. 127, 136 (1994) (quoting Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 684 (1973) (plurality opinion)). Sex-based generalizations both reflect and reinforce \"fixed notions concerning the roles and abilities of males and females.\" Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 725 (1982).~    ~    ~      57~      For these reasons, a party who seeks to defend a statute that classifies individuals on the basis of sex \"must carry the burden of showing an 'exceedingly persuasive justification' for the classification.\" Id., at 724 (quoting Kirchberg v. Feenstra, 450 U.S. 455, 461 (1981)); see also United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 531 (1996). The defender of the classification meets this burden \"only by showing at least that the classification serves 'important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed' are 'substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.' \" Mississippi Univ. for Women, supra, at 724 (quoting Wengler v. Druggists Mut. Ins. Co., 446 U.S. 142, 150 (1980)); see also Virginia, supra, at 533.~    ~    ~      58~      Our cases provide significant guidance concerning the meaning of this standard and how a reviewing court is to apply it. This Court's instruction concerning the application of heightened scrutiny to sex-based classifications stands in stark contrast to our elucidation of the rudiments of rational basis review. To begin with, under heightened scrutiny, \"[t]he burden of justification is demanding and it rests entirely on [the party defending the classification].\" Virginia, supra, at 533. Under rational basis scrutiny, by contrast, the defender of the classification \"has no obligation to produce evidence to sustain the rationality of a statutory classification.\" Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 320 (1993). Instead, \"[t]he burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it, whether or not the basis has a foundation in the record.\" Id., at 320-321 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).~    ~    ~      59~      Further, a justification that sustains a sex-based classification \"must be genuine, not hypothesized or invented post hoc in response to litigation.\" Virginia, supra, at 533. \"[T]he mere recitation of a benign, compensatory purpose is not an automatic shield which protects against any inquiry into the actual purposes underlying a statutory scheme.\" Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636, 648 (1975). Under rational basis review, by contrast, it is \" 'constitutionally irrelevant [what] reasoning in fact underlay the legislative decision.' \" Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U.S. 166, 179 (1980) (quoting Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 612 (1960)).~    ~    ~      60~      Heightened scrutiny does not countenance justifications that \"rely on overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males and females.\" Virginia, supra, at 533. Rational basis review, by contrast, is much more tolerant of the use of broad generalizations about different classes of individuals, so long as the classification is not arbitrary or irrational. See, e.g., Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 84 (2000); Fritz, supra, at 177.~    ~    ~      61~      Moreover, overbroad sex-based generalizations are impermissible even when they enjoy empirical support. See, e.g., J. E. B., supra, at 139, n. 11; Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 199 (1976); Wiesenfeld, supra, at 645. Under rational basis scrutiny, however, empirical support is not even necessary to sustain a classification. See, e.g., FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 315 (1993) (\"[A] legislative choice is not subject to courtroom factfinding and may be based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data\").~    ~    ~      62~      The different burdens imposed by these equal protection standards correspond to the different duties of a reviewing court in applying each standard. The court's task in applying heightened scrutiny to a sex-based classification is clear: \"Focusing on the differential treatment or denial of opportunity for which relief is sought, the reviewing court must determine whether the proffered justification is 'exceedingly persuasive.' \" Virginia, 518 U.S., at 532-533. In making this determination, the court must inquire into the actual purposes of the discrimination, for \"a tenable justification must describe actual state purposes, not rationalizations for actions in fact differently grounded.\" Id., at 535-536; see also id., at 533; Wiesenfeld, supra, at 648; Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U.S. 199, 212-217 (1977) (plurality opinion); id., at 219-221 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). The rational basis standard, on the other hand, instructs that \"a classification 'must be upheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.' \" Heller, supra, at 320 (quoting Beach Communications, supra, at 313). This standard permits a court to hypothesize interests that might support legislative distinctions, whereas heightened scrutiny limits the realm of justification to demonstrable reality.~    ~    ~      63~      These different standards of equal protection review also set different bars for the magnitude of the governmental interest that justifies the statutory classification. Heightened scrutiny demands that the governmental interest served by the classification be \"important,\" see, e.g., Virginia, supra, at 533, whereas rational basis scrutiny requires only that the end be \"legitimate,\" see, e.g., Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 10 (1992).~    ~    ~      64~      The most important difference between heightened scrutiny and rational basis review, of course, is the required fit between the means employed and the ends served. Under heightened scrutiny, the discriminatory means must be \"substantially related\" to an actual and important governmental interest. See, e.g., Virginia, supra, at 533. Under rational basis scrutiny, the means need only be \"rationally related\" to a conceivable and legitimate state end. See, e.g., Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 440 (1985).~    ~    ~      65~      The fact that other means are better suited to the achievement of governmental ends therefore is of no moment under rational basis review. See, e.g., Vance v. Bradley, 440 U.S. 93, 103, n. 20 (1979) (\"Even were it not irrelevant to [rational basis review] that other alternatives might achieve approximately the same results . . .\"); Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 316 (1976) (per curiam) (\"[T]he State perhaps has not chosen the best means to accomplish this purpose. But where rationality is the test, a State 'does not violate the Equal Protection Clause merely because the classifications made by its laws are imperfect' \" (quoting Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 485 (1970))). But because we require a much tighter fit between means and ends under heightened scrutiny, the availability of sex-neutral alternatives to a sex-based classification is often highly probative of the validity of the classification. See, e.g., Wengler, 446 U.S., at 151 (invalidating a sex-based classification where a sex-neutral approach would completely serve the needs of both classes); Orr v. Orr, 440 U.S. 268, 281 (1979) (finding \"no reason, therefore, to use sex as a proxy for need\" where the alimony statute already provided for individualized hearings that took financial circumstances into account); Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S., at 653 (finding a gender-based distinction to be \"gratuitous\" where \"without it, the statutory scheme would only provide benefits to those men who are in fact similarly situated to the women the statute aids\").~    ~    II~    ~      66~      The Court recites the governing substantive standard for heightened scrutiny of sex-based classifications, see ante, at 5, 15, but departs from the guidance of our precedents concerning such classifications in several ways. In the first sentence of its equal protection analysis, the majority glosses over the crucial matter of the burden of justification. Ante, at 5 (\"For a gender-based classification to withstand equal protection scrutiny, it must be established . . .\"); see also ante, at 15. In other circumstances, the Court's use of an impersonal construction might represent a mere elision of what we have stated expressly in our prior cases. Here, however, the elision presages some of the larger failings of the opinion.~    ~    ~      67~      For example, the majority hypothesizes about the interests served by the statute and fails adequately to inquire into the actual purposes of 1409(a)(4). The Court also does not always explain adequately the importance of the interests that it claims to be served by the provision. The majority also fails carefully to consider whether the sex-based classification is being used impermissibly \"as a 'proxy for other, more germane bases of classification,' \" Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U.S., at 726 (quoting Craig, 429 U.S., at 198), and instead casually dismisses the relevance of available sex-neutral alternatives. And, contrary to the majority's conclusion, the fit between the means and ends of 1409(a)(4) is far too attenuated for the provision to survive heightened scrutiny. In all, the majority opinion represents far less than the rigorous application of heightened scrutiny that our precedents require.~    ~    ~      68~      * According to the Court, \"[t]he first governmental interest to be served is the importance of assuring that a biological parent-child relationship exists.\" Ante, at 7. The majority does not elaborate on the importance of this interest, which presumably lies in preventing fraudulent conveyances of citizenship. Nor does the majority demonstrate that this is one of the actual purposes of 1409(a)(4). Assuming that Congress actually had this purpose in mind in enacting parts of 1409(a)(4), cf. Miller v. Albright, 523 U.S. 420, 435-436 (1998) (opinion of Stevens, J.), the INS does not appear to rely on this interest in its effort to sustain 1409(a)(4)'s sex-based classification. Cf. Brief for Respondent 11 (claiming that 1409 serves \"at least two important interests: first, ensuring that children who are born abroad out of wedlock have, during their minority, attained a sufficiently recognized or formal relationship to their United States citizen parent-and thus to the United States-to justify the conferral of citizenship upon them; and second, preventing such children from being stateless\"). In light of the reviewing court's duty to \"determine whether the proffered justification is 'exceedingly persuasive,' \" Virginia, 518 U.S., at 533, this disparity between the majority's defense of the statute and the INS' proffered justifications is striking, to say the least.~    ~    ~      69~      The gravest defect in the Court's reliance on this interest, however, is the insufficiency of the fit between 1409(a)(4)'s discriminatory means and the asserted end. Section 1409(c) imposes no particular burden of proof on mothers wishing to convey citizenship to their children. By contrast, 1409(a)(1), which petitioners do not challenge before this Court, requires that \"a blood relationship between the person and the father [be] established by clear and convincing evidence.\" Atop 1409(a)(1), 1409(a)(4) requires legitimation, an acknowledgment of paternity in writing under oath, or an adjudication of paternity before the child reaches the age of 18. It is difficult to see what 1409(a)(4) accomplishes in furtherance of \"assuring that a biological parent-child relationship exists,\" ante, at 7, that 1409(a)(1) does not achieve on its own. The virtual certainty of a biological link that modern DNA testing affords reinforces the sufficiency of 1409(a)(1). See Miller, supra, at 484-485 (Breyer, J., dissenting).~    ~    ~      70~      It is also difficult to see how 1409(a)(4)'s limitation of the time allowed for obtaining proof of paternity substantially furthers the assurance of a blood relationship. Modern DNA testing, in addition to providing accuracy unmatched by other methods of establishing a biological link, essentially negates the evidentiary significance of the passage of time. Moreover, the application of 1409(a)(1)'s \"clear and convincing evidence\" requirement can account for any effect that the passage of time has on the quality of the evidence.~    ~    ~      71~      The Court criticizes petitioners' reliance on the availability and sophistication of modern DNA tests, ante, at 8, but appears to misconceive the relevance of such tests. No one argues that 1409(a)(1) mandates a DNA test. Legitimation or an adjudication of paternity, see 1409(a)(4)(A), (C), may well satisfy the \"clear and convincing\" standard of 1409(a)(1). (Satisfaction of 1409(a)(4) by a written acknowledgment of paternity under oath, see 1409(a)(4)(B), would seem to do little, if anything, to advance the assurance of a blood relationship, further stretching the means-end fit in this context). Likewise, petitioners' argument does not depend on the idea that one particular method of establishing paternity is constitutionally required. Petitioners' argument rests instead on the fact that, if the goal is to obtain proof of paternity, the existence of a statutory provision governing such proof, coupled with the efficacy and availability of modern technology, is highly relevant to the sufficiency of the tailoring between 1409(a)(4)'s sex-based classification and the asserted end. Because 1409(a)(4) adds little to the work that 1409(a)(1) does on its own, it is difficult to say that 1409(a)(4) \"substantially furthers\" an important governmental interest. Kirchberg, 450 U.S., at 461.~    ~    ~      72~      The majority concedes that Congress could achieve the goal of assuring a biological parent-child relationship in a sex-neutral fashion, but then, in a surprising turn, dismisses the availability of sex-neutral alternatives as irrelevant. As the Court suggests, \"Congress could have required both mothers and fathers to prove parenthood within 30 days or, for that matter, 18 years, of the child's birth.\" Ante, at 9 (citing Miller, supra, at 436 (opinion of Stevens, J.)). Indeed, whether one conceives the majority's asserted interest as assuring the existence of a biological parent-child relationship, ante, at 7, or as ensuring acceptable documentation of that relationship, ante, at 8, a number of sex-neutral arrangements-including the one that the majority offers-would better serve that end. As the majority seems implicitly to acknowledge at one point, ante, at 7, a mother will not always have formal legal documentation of birth because a birth certificate may not issue or may subsequently be lost. Conversely, a father's name may well appear on a birth certificate. While it is doubtless true that a mother's blood relation to a child is uniquely \"verifiable from the birth itself\" to those present at birth, ante, at 7, the majority has not shown that a mother's birth relation is uniquely verifiable by the INS, much less that any greater verifiability warrants a sex-based, rather than a sex-neutral, statute.~    ~    ~      73~      In our prior cases, the existence of comparable or superior sex-neutral alternatives has been a powerful reason to reject a sex-based classification. See supra, at 5. The majority, however, turns this principle on its head by denigrating as \"hollow\" the very neutrality that the law requires. Ante, at 9. While the majority trumpets the availability of superior sex-neutral alternatives as confirmation of 1409(a)(4)'s validity, our precedents demonstrate that this fact is a decided strike against the law. Far from being \"hollow,\" the avoidance of gratuitous sex-based distinctions is the hallmark of equal protection. Cf. J. E. B., 511 U.S., at 152-153 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (\" 'At the heart of the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection lies the simple command that the Government must treat citizens as individuals, not as simply components of a racial [or] sexual . . . class' \" (quoting Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U.S. 547, 602 (1990) (O'Connor, J., dissenting))).~    ~    ~      74~      The majority's acknowledgment of the availability of sex-neutral alternatives scarcely confirms the point that \"[t]he differential treatment is inherent in a sensible statutory scheme.\" Ante, at 9. The discussion instead demonstrates that, at most, differential impact will result from the fact that \"[f]athers and mothers are not similarly situated with regard to the proof of biological parenthood.\" Ante, at 8. In other words, it will likely be easier for mothers to satisfy a sex-neutral proof of parentage requirement. But facially neutral laws that have a disparate impact are a different animal for purposes of constitutional analysis than laws that specifically provide for disparate treatment. We have long held that the differential impact of a facially neutral law does not trigger heightened scrutiny, see, e.g., Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229 (1976), whereas we apply heightened scrutiny to laws that facially classify individuals on the basis of their sex. See, e.g., United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515 (1996); see also J. E. B., supra, at 152 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (\"[O]ur case law does reveal a strong presumption that gender classifications are invalid\"); Parham v. Hughes, 441 U.S. 347, 351 (1979) (plurality opinion) (\"Not all legislation, however, is entitled to the same presumption of validity. . . . [T]he presumption of statutory validity may also be undermined when a State has enacted legislation creating classes based upon certain other immutable human attributes\" (citing, inter alia, Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971))).~    ~    ~      75~      If rational basis scrutiny were appropriate in this case, then the claim that \"[t]he Constitution . . . does not require that Congress elect one particular mechanism from among many possible methods of establishing paternity,\" ante, at 8, would have much greater force. So too would the claim that \"[t]he requirement of 1409(a)(4) represents a reasonable conclusion . . . .\" Ante, at 8. But fidelity to the Constitution's pledge of equal protection demands more when a facially sex-based classification is at issue. This is not because we sit in judgment of the wisdom of laws in one instance but not the other, cf. Beach Communications, 508 U.S., at 313, but rather because of the potential for \"injury . . . to personal dignity\" J. E. B., supra, at 153 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment), that inheres in or accompanies so many sex-based classifications.~    ~    B~    ~      76~      The Court states that \"[t]he second important governmental interest furthered in a substantial manner by 1409(a)(4) is the determination to ensure that the child and the citizen parent have some demonstrated opportunity or potential to develop not just a relationship that is recognized, as a formal matter, by the law, but one that consists of the real, everyday ties that provide a connection between child and citizen parent and, in turn, the United States.\" Ante, at 9-10. The Court again fails to demonstrate that this was Congress' actual purpose in enacting 1409(a)(4). The majority's focus on \"some demonstrated opportunity or potential to develop . . . real, everyday ties,\" in fact appears to be the type of hypothesized rationale that is insufficient under heightened scrutiny. See supra, at 2-4.~    ~    ~      77~      The INS asserts the governmental interest of \"ensuring that children who are born abroad out of wedlock have, during their minority, attained a sufficiently recognized or formal relationship to their United States citizen parent-and thus to the United States-to justify the conferral of citizenship upon them.\" Brief for Respondent 11. The majority's asserted end, at best, is a simultaneously watered-down and beefed-up version of this interest asserted by the INS. The majority's rendition is weaker than the INS' in that it emphasizes the \"opportunity or potential to develop\" a relationship rather than the actual relationship about which the INS claims Congress was concerned. The majority's version is also stronger in that it goes past the formal relationship apparently desired by the INS to \"real, everyday ties.\"~    ~    ~      78~      Assuming, as the majority does, that Congress was actually concerned about ensuring a \"demonstrated opportunity\" for a relationship, it is questionable whether such an opportunity qualifies as an \"important\" governmental interest apart from the existence of an actual relationship. By focusing on \"opportunity\" rather than reality, the majority presumably improves the chances of a sufficient means-end fit. But in doing so, it dilutes significantly the weight of the interest. It is difficult to see how, in this citizenship-conferral context, anyone profits from a \"demonstrated opportunity\" for a relationship in the absence of the fruition of an actual tie. Children who have an \"opportunity\" for such a tie with a parent, of course, may never develop an actual relationship with that parent. See Miller, 523 U.S., at 440 (opinion of Stevens, J.). If a child grows up in a foreign country without any postbirth contact with the citizen parent, then the child's never-realized \"opportunity\" for a relationship with the citizen seems singularly irrelevant to the appropriateness of granting citizenship to that child. Likewise, where there is an actual relationship, it is the actual relationship that does all the work in rendering appropriate a grant of citizenship, regardless of when and how the opportunity for that relationship arose.~    ~    ~      79~      Accepting for the moment the majority's focus on \"opportunity,\" the attempt to justify 1409(a)(4) in these terms is still deficient. Even if it is important \"to require that an opportunity for a parent-child relationship occur during the formative years of the child's minority,\" ante, at 13, it is difficult to see how the requirement that proof of such opportunity be obtained before the child turns 18 substantially furthers the asserted interest. As the facts of this case demonstrate, ante, at 2, it is entirely possible that a father and child will have the opportunity to develop a relationship and in fact will develop a relationship without obtaining the proof of the opportunity during the child's minority. After his parents' relationship had ended, petitioner Nguyen lived with the family of his father's new girlfriend. In 1975, before his sixth birthday, Nguyen came to the United States, where he was reared by his father, petitioner Boulais. In 1997, a DNA test showed a 99.98% probability of paternity, and, in 1998, Boulais obtained an order of parentage from a Texas court.~    ~    ~      80~      Further underscoring the gap between the discriminatory means and the asserted end is the possibility that \"a child might obtain an adjudication of paternity 'absent any affirmative act by the father, and perhaps even over his express objection.' \" Miller, 523 U.S., at 486 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (quoting id., at 434 (opinion of Stevens, J.)). The fact that the means-end fit can break down so readily in theory, and not just in practice, is hardly characteristic of a \"substantial\" means-end relationship.~    ~    ~      81~      Moreover, available sex-neutral alternatives would at least replicate, and could easily exceed, whatever fit there is between 1409(a)(4)'s discriminatory means and the majority's asserted end. According to the Court, 1409(a)(4) is designed to ensure that fathers and children have the same \"opportunity which the event of birth itself provides for the mother and child.\" Ante, at 12. Even assuming that this is so, Congress could simply substitute for 1409(a)(4) a requirement that the parent be present at birth or have knowledge of birth. Cf. Miller, supra, at 487 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Congress could at least allow proof of such presence or knowledge to be one way of demonstrating an opportunity for a relationship. Under the present law, the statute on its face accords different treatment to a mother who is by nature present at birth and a father who is by choice present at birth even though those two individuals are similarly situated with respect to the \"opportunity\" for a relationship. The mother can transmit her citizenship at birth, but the father cannot do so in the absence of at least one other affirmative act. The different statutory treatment is solely on account of the sex of the similarly situated individuals. This type of treatment is patently inconsistent with the promise of equal protection of the laws. See, e.g., Reed, 404 U.S., at 77 (\"By providing dissimilar treatment for men and women who are thus similarly situated, the challenged section violates the Equal Protection Clause\").~    ~    ~      82~      Indeed, the idea that a mother's presence at birth supplies adequate assurance of an opportunity to develop a relationship while a father's presence at birth does not would appear to rest only on an overbroad sex-based generalization. A mother may not have an opportunity for a relationship if the child is removed from his or her mother on account of alleged abuse or neglect, or if the child and mother are separated by tragedy, such as disaster or war, of the sort apparently present in this case. There is no reason, other than stereotype, to say that fathers who are present at birth lack an opportunity for a relationship on similar terms. The \"[p]hysical differences between men and women,\" Virginia, 518 U.S., at 533, therefore do not justify 1409(a)(4)'s discrimination.~    ~    ~      83~      The majority later ratchets up the interest, for the sake of argument, to \"the establishment of a real, practical relationship of considerable substance between parent and child in every case, as opposed simply to ensuring the potential for the relationship to begin.\" Ante, at 15. But the majority then dismisses the distinction between opportunity and reality as immaterial to the inquiry in this case. Ibid. The majority rests its analysis of the means-end fit largely on the following proposition: \"It is almost axiomatic that a policy which seeks to foster the opportunity for meaningful parent-child bonds to develop has a close and substantial bearing on the governmental interest in the actual formation of that bond.\" Ibid. A bare assertion of what is allegedly \"almost axiomatic,\" however, is no substitute for the \"demanding\" burden of justification borne by the defender of the classification. Virginia, supra, at 533.~    ~    ~      84~      Moreover, the Court's reasoning hardly conforms to the tailoring requirement of heightened scrutiny. The fact that a discriminatory policy embodies the good intention of \"seek[ing] to foster\" the opportunity for something beneficial to happen is of little relevance in itself to whether the policy substantially furthers the desired occurrence. Whether the classification indeed \"has a close and substantial bearing\" on the actual occurrence of the preferred result depends on facts and circumstances and must be proved by the classification's defender. Far from being a virtual axiom, the relationship between the intent to foster an opportunity and the fruition of the desired effect is merely a contingent proposition. The majority's sweeping claim is no surrogate for the careful application of heightened scrutiny to a particular classification.~    ~    ~      85~      The question that then remains is the sufficiency of the fit between 1409(a)(4)'s discriminatory means and the goal of \"establish[ing] . . . a real, practical relationship of considerable substance.\" Ante, at 15. If Congress wishes to advance this end, it could easily do so by employing a sex-neutral classification that is a far \"more germane bas[i]s of classification\" than sex, Craig, 429 U. S, at 198. For example, Congress could require some degree of regular contact between the child and the citizen parent over a period of time. See Miller, 523 U.S., at 470 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).~    ~    ~      86~      The majority again raises this possibility of the use of sex-neutral means only to dismiss it as irrelevant. The Court admits that \"Congress could excuse compliance with the formal requirements when an actual father-child relationship is proved,\" but speculates that Congress did not do so \"perhaps because of the subjectivity, intrusiveness, and difficulties of proof that might attend an inquiry into any particular bond or tie.\" Ante, at 14. We have repeatedly rejected efforts to justify sex-based classifications on the ground of administrative convenience. See, e.g., Wengler, 446 U.S., at 152; Frontiero, 411 U.S., at 690-691. There is no reason to think that this is a case where administrative convenience concerns are so powerful that they would justify the sex-based discrimination, cf. Wengler, supra, at 152, especially where the use of sex as a proxy is so ill fit to the purported ends as it is here. And to the extent Congress might seek simply to ensure an \"opportunity\" for a relationship, little administrative inconvenience would seem to accompany a sex-neutral requirement of presence at birth, knowledge of birth, or contact between parent and child prior to a certain age.~    ~    ~      87~      The claim that 1409(a)(4) substantially relates to the achievement of the goal of a \"real, practical relationship\" thus finds support not in biological differences but instead in a stereotype-i.e., \"the generalization that mothers are significantly more likely than fathers . . . to develop caring relationships with their children.\" Miller, supra, at 482-483 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Such a claim relies on \"the very stereotype the law condemns,\" J. E. B., 511 U.S., at 138 (internal quotation marks omitted), \"lends credibility\" to the generalization, Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U.S., at 730, and helps to convert that \"assumption\" into \"a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" ibid. See also J. E. B., supra, at 140 (\"When state actors exercise peremptory challenges in reliance on gender stereotypes, they ratify and reinforce prejudicial views of the relative abilities of men and women\"). Indeed, contrary to this stereotype, Boulais has reared Nguyen, while Nguyen apparently has lacked a relationship with his mother.~    ~    ~      88~      The majority apparently tries to avoid reliance on this stereotype by characterizing the governmental interest as a \"demonstrated opportunity\" for a relationship and attempting to close the gap between opportunity and reality with a dubious claim about what is \"almost axiomatic.\" But the fact that one route is wisely forgone does not mean that the other is plausibly taken. The inescapable conclusion instead is that 1409(a)(4) lacks an exceedingly persuasive justification.~    ~    ~      89~      In denying petitioner's claim that 1409(a)(4) rests on stereotypes, the majority articulates a misshapen notion of \"stereotype\" and its significance in our equal protection jurisprudence. The majority asserts that a \"stereotype\" is \"defined as a frame of mind resulting from irrational or uncritical analysis.\" Ante, at 13. This Court has long recognized, however, that an impermissible stereotype may enjoy empirical support and thus be in a sense \"rational.\" See, e.g., J. E. B., supra, at 139, n. 11 (\"We have made abundantly clear in past cases that gender classifications that rest on impermissible stereotypes violate the Equal Protection Clause, even when some statistical support can be conjured up for the generalization\"); Craig, 429 U.S., at 201 (invalidating a sex-based classification even though the evidence supporting the distinction was \"not trivial in a statistical sense\"); id., at 202 (noting that \"prior cases have consistently rejected the use of sex as a decisionmaking factor even though the statutes in question certainly rested on far more predictive empirical relationships than this\"); Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S., at 645 (invalidating a sex-based classification even though the underlying generalization was \"not entirely without empirical support\"). Indeed, the stereotypes that underlie a sex-based classification \"may hold true for many, even most, individuals.\" Miller, 523 U.S., at 460 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). But in numerous cases where a measure of truth has inhered in the generalization, \"the Court has rejected official actions that classify unnecessarily and overbroadly by gender when more accurate and impartial functional lines can be drawn.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      90~      Nor do stereotypes consist only of those overbroad generalizations that the reviewing court considers to \"show disrespect\" for a class, ante, at 18. Compare, e.g., Craig, supra, at 198-201. The hallmark of a stereotypical sex-based classification under this Court's precedents is not whether the classification is insulting, but whether it \"relie[s] upon the simplistic, outdated assumption that gender could be used as a 'proxy for other, more germane bases of classification.' \" Mississippi Univ. for Women, supra, at 726 (quoting Craig, supra, at 198).~    ~    ~      91~      It is also important to note that, while our explanations of many decisions invalidating sex-based classifications have pointed to the problems of \"stereotypes\" and \"overbroad generalizations,\" these explanations certainly do not mean that the burden is on the challenger of the classification to prove legislative reliance on such generalizations. Indeed, an arbitrary distinction between the sexes may rely on no identifiable generalization at all but may simply be a denial of opportunity out of pure caprice. Such a distinction, of course, would nonetheless be a classic equal protection violation. The burden of proving that use of a sex-based classification substantially relates to the achievement of an important governmental interest remains unmistakably and entirely with the classification's defender. See, e.g., Virginia, 518 U.S., at 532-533.~    ~    C~    ~      92~      The Court has also failed even to acknowledge the \"volumes of history\" to which \"[t]oday's skeptical scrutiny of official action denying rights or opportunities based on sex responds.\" Id., at 531. The history of sex discrimination in laws governing the transmission of citizenship and with respect to parental responsibilities for children born out of wedlock counsels at least some circumspection in discerning legislative purposes in this context. See generally Miller, supra, at 460-468 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).~    ~    ~      93~      Section 1409 was first enacted as 205 of the Nationality Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1139-1140. The 1940 Act had been proposed by the President, forwarding a report by a specially convened Committee of Advisors, including the Attorney General. The Committee explained to Congress the rationale for 205, whose sex-based classification remains in effect today:~    ~    ~      94~      \"[T]he Department of State has, at least since 1912, uniformly held that an illegitimate child born abroad of an American mother acquires at birth the nationality of the mother, in the absence of legitimation or adjudication establishing the paternity of the child. This ruling is based . . . on the ground that the mother in such case stands in the place of the father. . . . [U]nder American law the mother has a right to custody and control of such child as against the putative father, and is bound to maintain it as its natural guardian. This rule seems to be in accord with the old Roman law and with the laws of Spain and France.\" To Revise and Codify the Nationality Laws of the United States, Hearings on H. R. 6127 before the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., 431 (1945) (reprinting Message from the President, Nationality Laws of the United States (1938)) (emphasis added and internal quotation marks and citations omitted).~    ~    ~      95~      Section 1409(a)(4) is thus paradigmatic of a historic regime that left women with responsibility, and freed men from responsibility, for nonmarital children. Under this law, as one advocate explained to Congress in a 1932 plea for a sex-neutral citizenship law, \"when it comes to the illegitimate child, which is a great burden, then the mother is the only recognized parent, and the father is put safely in the background.\" Naturalization and Citizenship Status of Certain Children of Mothers Who Are Citizens of the United States, Hearing on H. R. 5489 before the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization, 72nd Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (testimony of Burnita Shelton Matthews); see also id., at 5 (citizenship law \"permit[s] [the father] to escape the burdens incident to illegitimate parenthood\"). Unlike 1409(a)(4), our States' child custody and support laws no longer assume that mothers alone are \"bound\" to serve as \"natural guardians\" of nonmarital children. See, e.g., Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. 25-501 (1999) (equal duties of support); cf. Cal. Civ. Code Ann. 4600 (West 1972) (abolishing \"tender years\" doctrine). The majority, however, rather than confronting the stereotypical notion that mothers must care for these children and fathers may ignore them, quietly condones the \"very stereotype the law condemns,\" J. E. B., 511 U.S., at 138 (internal quotation marks omitted).~    ~    ~      96~      Punctuating the disparity between the majority's and the INS' accounts of the governmental interests at stake is the majority's failure even to address the INS' second asserted rationale: that 1409 prevents certain children from being stateless. Brief for Respondent 11; see also id., at 17-18 (describing statelessness problem). The Court certainly has good reason to reject this asserted rationale. Indeed, the INS hardly even attempts to show how the statelessness concern justifies the discriminatory means of 1409(a)(4) in particular. The INS instead undertakes a demonstration of how the statelessness concern justifies 1409(c)'s relaxed residency requirements for citizen mothers. See Brief for Respondent 17-19, 42-43, 44, n. 23. But petitioners do not challenge here the distinction between 1401(g), which requires that citizen fathers have previously resided in the United States for five years, including at least two years after the age of 14, and 1409(c), which provides that a citizen mother need only have resided in the United States for one year. The INS' proffered justification of statelessness thus does nothing to buttress the case for 1409(a)(4).~    ~    ~      97~      The Court also makes a number of observations that tend, on the whole, to detract and distract from the relevant equal protection inquiry. For example, presumably referring to 1409 in general, the majority suggests that \"the statute simply ensures equivalence between two expectant mothers who are citizens abroad if one chooses to reenter for the child's birth and the other chooses not to return, or does not have the means to do so.\" Ante, at 6. But even apart from the question whether this was one of Congress' actual purposes (and the majority does not affirmatively claim that it was), this equivalence is quite beside the point of petitioners' constitutional challenge, which is directed at the dissimilar treatment accorded to fathers and mothers.~    ~    ~      98~      The Court also states that the obligation imposed by 1409(a)(4) is \"minimal\" and does not present \"inordinate and unnecessary hurdles\" to the acquisition of citizenship by the nonmarital child of a citizen father. Ante, at 16. Even assuming that the burden is minimal (and the question whether the hurdle is \"unnecessary\" is quite different in kind from the question whether it is burdensome), it is well settled that \"the 'absence of an insurmountable barrier' will not redeem an otherwise unconstitutionally discriminatory law.\" Kirchberg, 450 U.S., at 461 (quoting Trimble v. Gordon, 430 U.S. 762, 774 (1977)).~    ~    ~      99~      Finally, while the recitation of statistics concerning military personnel and overseas travel, ante, at 10-11, highlights the opportunities for United States citizens to interact with citizens of foreign countries, it bears little on the question whether 1409(a)(4)'s discriminatory means are a permissible governmental response to those circumstances. Indeed, the majority's discussion may itself simply reflect the stereotype of male irresponsibility that is no more a basis for the validity of the classification than are stereotypes about the \"traditional\" behavior patterns of women.~    ~    ~      100~      It is, of course, true that the failure to recognize relevant differences is out of line with the command of equal protection. See ante, at 18. But so too do we undermine the promise of equal protection when we try to make our differences carry weight they simply cannot bear. This promise informs the proper application of heightened scrutiny to sex-based classifications and demands our scrupulous adherence to that test.~    ~    III~    ~      101~      The Court identifies two \"additional obstacles\" that petitioners would face even were the Court to accept the conclusion that the statute fails heightened scrutiny. Ante, at 17-18. The first question concerns \" 'potential problems with fashioning a remedy.' \" Ante, at 17 (quoting Miller, 523 U.S., at 451 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (citing id., at 452-459 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment))). The second question concerns \"the implications of statements in our earlier cases regarding the wide deference afforded to Congress in the exercise of its immigration and naturalization power.\" Ante, at 18. I believe that petitioners are able to surmount both of these hurdles.~    ~    ~      102~      As to the matter of remedy, severance of 1409(a)(4) would have been appropriate had petitioners prevailed. Several factors support this conclusion. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) contains a general severability clause, which provides: \"If any particular provision of this Act, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder of the Act and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\" 406, 66 Stat. 281; see note following 8 U.S.C.  1101 p. 38, \"Separability.\" We have concluded that this severability clause \"is unambiguous and gives rise to a presumption that Congress did not intend the validity of the [INA] as a whole, or any part of the [INA], to depend upon whether\" any one provision was unconstitutional. INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 932 (1983).~    ~    ~      103~      Title 8 U.S.C.  1421(d), which states that \"[a] person may only be naturalized as a citizen of the United States in the manner and under the conditions prescribed in this subchapter and not otherwise,\" has no effect on the operation of the INA's general severability clause in this case. Section 1421(d) governs only naturalization, which the statute defines as \"the conferring of nationality of a state upon a person after birth,\" 1101(a)(23), whereas 1401(g) and 1409 deal with the transmission of citizenship at birth, see 1401 (\"The following shall be nationals and citizens of the United States at birth . . .\"). Further, unlike the INA's general severability clause, 1421(d) does not specifically address the scenario where a particular provision is held invalid. Indeed, the INS does not even rely on 1421(d) in its brief.~    ~    ~      104~      Nor does our decision in INS v. Pangilinan, 486 U.S. 875 (1988), preclude severance here. In Pangilinan, this Court held that courts lack equitable authority to order the naturalization of persons who did not satisfy the statutory requirements for naturalization. Id., at 883-885. Petitioners in the instant case, however, seek the exercise of no such equitable power. Petitioners instead seek severance of the offending provisions so that the statute, free of its constitutional defect, can operate to determine whether citizenship was transmitted at birth. Cf. Miller, supra, at 488-489 (Breyer, J., dissenting).~    ~    ~      105~      In addition to the severance clause, this Court has often concluded that, in the absence of legislative direction not to sever the infirm provision, \"extension, rather than nullification\" of a benefit is more faithful to the legislative design. Califano v. Westcott, 443 U.S. 76, 89-90 (1979); see also Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636; Frontiero, 411 U.S., at 691, n. 25. The choice of extension over nullification also would have the virtue of avoiding injury to parties who are not represented in the instant litigation. And Congress, of course, remains free to redesign the statute in a manner that comports with the Constitution.~    ~    ~      106~      As to the question of deference, the pivotal case is Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787 (1977). Fiallo, however, is readily distinguished. Fiallo involved constitutional challenges to various statutory distinctions, including a classification based on the sex of a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident, that determined the availability of a special immigration preference to certain aliens by virtue of their relationship with the citizen or lawful permanent resident. Id., at 788-792; see also Miller, supra, at 429 (opinion of Stevens, J.). The Court, emphasizing \"the limited scope of judicial inquiry into immigration legislation,\" 430 U.S., at 792, rejected the constitutional challenges. The Court noted its repeated prior emphasis that \" 'over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress more complete than it is over' the admission of aliens.\" Ibid. (quoting Oceanic Steam Nav. Co. v. Stranahan, 214 U.S. 320, 339 (1909)).~    ~    ~      107~      The instant case is not about the admission of aliens but instead concerns the logically prior question whether an individual is a citizen in the first place. A predicate for application of the deference commanded by Fiallo is that the individuals concerned be aliens. But whether that predicate obtains is the very matter at issue in this case. Cf. Miller, 523 U.S., at 433, n. 10 (opinion of Stevens, J.) (\"[T]he Government now argues . . . that an alien outside the territory of the United States has no substantive rights cognizable under the Fifth Amendment. Even if that is so, the question to be decided is whether petitioner is such an alien or whether, as [petitioner] claims, [petitioner] is a citizen. Thus, we must address the merits to determine whether the predicate for this argument is accurate\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Because 1401 and 1409 govern the conferral of citizenship at birth, and not the admission of aliens, the ordinary standards of equal protection review apply. See id., at 480-481 (Breyer, J., dissenting).~    ~    ~      108~      * * *~    ~    ~      109~      No one should mistake the majority's analysis for a careful application of this Court's equal protection jurisprudence concerning sex-based classifications. Today's decision instead represents a deviation from a line of cases in which we have vigilantly applied heightened scrutiny to such classifications to determine whether a constitutional violation has occurred. I trust that the depth and vitality of these precedents will ensure that today's error remains an aberration. I respectfully dissent.~    ~    ",

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.ALABAMA, PETITIONERv.MICHAEL HERMAN BOZEMAN\r~    No. 00-492.\r~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\r~    Argued April 17, 2001Decided June 11, 2001\r~    \r~      Syllabus\r~      The Interstate Agreement on Detainers (Agreement) creates uniform procedures for lodging and executing a detainer, i.e., a legal order that requires a State to hold a currently imprisoned individual when he has finished serving his sentence so that he may be tried by a different State for a different crime. As relevant here, the Agreement provides that a State that obtains a prisoner for purposes of trial must try him within 120 days of his arrival, Art. IV(c), and if it returns him to his \"original place of imprisonment\" prior to that trial, charges \"shall\" be dismissed with prejudice, Art. IV(e). While respondent Bozeman was serving a federal prison sentence in Florida, the Covington County, Alabama, district attorney sought temporary custody of Bozeman to arraign him on firearms charges and to appoint counsel. When taken to Covington County, Bozeman spent the night in the county jail, appeared in local court the next morning, obtained local counsel, and was returned to federal prison that evening. About one month later, he was brought back to the county for trial. Bozeman's counsel moved to dismiss the state charges on the ground that, because Bozeman had been \"returned to the original place of imprisonment\" (namely, the federal prison) \"prior to\" \"trial\" on state charges being \"had,\" in violation of Article IV(e), the local court had to dismiss the charges with prejudice in light of Art. IV(e)'s command as to remedy. Bozeman was convicted, and an appeals court affirmed. The State Supreme Court reversed, holding that the Agreement's literal language controlled and required dismissal of the state charges.\r~      Held: The literal language of Article IV(e) bars any further criminal proceedings when a defendant is returned to the original place of imprisonment before trial. Pp. 5-10.\r~      (a) Alabama claims that Article IV(e)'s basic purpose is to prevent shuttling that would interrupt a prisoner's rehabilitation and that, since the one-day interruption here did not interrupt rehabilitation significantly any violation is \"technical,\" \"harmless,\" or \"de minimus.\" However, the Agreement's language militates against an implicit exception, for it is absolute, as the word \"shall\" is ordinarily the language of command. Anderson v. Yungkau, 329 U.S. 482, 485. Moreover, the Agreement makes no distinction among different kinds of arrivals, e.g., exempting those that are followed by return within a short, specified time period, or those that are simply for arraignment purposes. Pp. 5-7.\r~      (b) Even assuming that the Agreement exempts violations that, viewed in terms of its purposes, are de minimus, the violation here could not qualify as trivial, because the \"no return\" provision's purpose cannot be a simple, direct effort to prevent the interruption of rehabilitation. Article IV(e)'s requirement that the prisoner remain in the county jail means that he will typically spend 120 days away from the sending State's rehabilitation programs, whereas returning him prior to trial-in violation of IV(e)-would permit him to participate in the sending State's program for some of those days. To call such a violation \"technical,\" because it means fewer days spent away from the sending State, is to call virtually every conceivable antishuttling violation \"technical.\" The Agreement may seek to remove rehabilitation obstructions in a different way: Requiring the receiving State to pay for the prisoner's incarceration during the pretrial period (pursuant to Article V) may give the State an incentive to shorten that period and dispose of detainers expeditiously. Alternatively, the Agreement's drafters may have sought to minimize the number of shuttles in the belief that the \"shuttling\" itself adds to the uncertainties obstructing rehabilitation programs, see Art. I. Regardless of the antishuttling remedy's original purpose, given the Agreement's absolute language, it is enough to explain why Alabama's view is not plausible and to point to other purposes more easily squared with Article IV(e)'s text and operation. Pp. 7-9.\r~      (c) Alabama's additional claim that return to the sending State after a brief journey to the receiving State for pretrial purposes is helpful, not harmful, to the prisoner is a policy argument more appropriately addressed to legislatures. And the federal statutory provision to which the Solicitor General points governs only when the United States is a receiving State, which does not help Alabama's cause. Although this Court rejects Alabama's interpretation of the Agreement, a receiving State is not barred from returning a prisoner when it would be mutually advantageous and the prisoner accordingly waives his Article IV(e) rights. Pp. 9-10.\r~      781 So. 2d 165, affirmed.\r~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ALABAMA\r~      Breyer, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, Parts I, II-A, and II-C of which were unanimous, and Part II-B of which was joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and Stevens, O'Connor, Kennedy, Souter, and Ginsburg, JJ.\r~      Opinion of the Court\r~      Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.*\r~    \r~    \r~      1\r~      Forty-eight States, the Federal Government, and the District of Columbia (all of which, for simplicity, we shall call \"States\") have entered into the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (Agreement), 18 U.S.C. App. 2, p. 692, an interstate compact. The Agreement creates uniform procedures for lodging and executing a detainer, i.e., a legal order that requires a State in which an individual is currently imprisoned to hold that individual when he has finished serving his sentence so that he may be tried by a different State for a different crime.\r~    \r~    \r~      2\r~      The Agreement provides for expeditious delivery of the prisoner to the receiving State for trial prior to the termination of his sentence in the sending State. And it seeks to minimize the consequent interruption of the prisoner's ongoing prison term. In particular, Article IV(c) specifies that the receiving State shall begin the prisoner's \"trial . . . within one hundred and twenty days of the arrival of the prisoner in the receiving State.\" At the same time, Article IV(e) prohibits return of the individual to the sending State before that trial is complete. It says:\r~    \r~    \r~      3\r~      \"If trial is not had on any indictment, information, or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the prisoner's being returned to the original place of imprisonment pursuant to article V(e) hereof, such indictment, information, or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.\" (Emphasis added.)\r~    \r~    \r~      4\r~      The case before us requires us to interpret the Article IV language that we have just quoted. See New York v. Hill, 528 U.S. 110, 111 (2000) (\"As 'a congressionally sanctioned interstate compact' within the Compact Clause of the United States Constitution, Art. I, 10, cl. 3, the [Interstate Agreement on Detainers] is a federal law subject to federal construction\") (quoting Carchman v. Nash, 473 U.S. 716, 719 (1985); Cuyler v. Adams, 449 U.S. 433, 442 (1981)). The case concerns a defendant whose initial imprisonment was interrupted briefly-for a single day-during which time he was brought to the receiving State for purposes of arraignment and then returned immediately to his original place of imprisonment. The question is whether, in such circumstances, the literal language of Article IV(e) bars any further criminal proceedings-because the defendant was \"returned to the original place of imprisonment\" before \"trial\" was \"had.\" We conclude that Article IV(e) does bar further proceedings, despite the fact that the interruption of the initial imprisonment lasted for only one day.\r~    \r~    \r~      5\r~      * A\r~    \r~    \r~      6\r~      The Council of State Governments drafted the language of the Agreement in 1956. See United States v. Mauro, 436 U.S. 340, 349-350 (1978). The United States joined in 1970. Id., at 343. And Alabama is one of the 49 other current members. Hill, supra, at 111; Ala. Code 15-9-81 (1995). The Agreement contains nine articles. Article I sets forth the problems that led to the Agreement's creation, namely, that \"charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations, or complaints and difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation.\" Article I then adds that \"it is the . . . purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of ... detainers ... .\"\r~    \r~    \r~      7\r~      Article II sets forth definitions. Article III gives a prisoner against whom a detainer has been lodged the right to \"request\" a \"final disposition\" of the relevant charges, in which case \"he shall be brought to trial within one hundred and eighty days\" (unless extended by the trial court for \"good cause\"); otherwise, the relevant \"indictment, information, or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.\" Art. III(a), (d).\r~    \r~    \r~      8\r~      Article IV gives \"the jurisdiction in which an untried indictment, information, or complaint is pending,\" i.e., the receiving State, the right \"to have a prisoner against whom\" it \"has lodged a detainer . . . made available\" for trial. Art. IV(a). It says further that, once the prisoner arrives in the receiving State, the \"trial\" must begin \"within one hundred and twenty days\" unless extended for \"good cause.\" Art. IV(c). Article IV also sets forth the \"antishuttling\" provision at issue here. To repeat: that provision says that trial must be \"had . . . prior to the prisoner's being returned to the original place of imprisonment\"; otherwise, the charges \"shall\" be dismissed with prejudice. Art. IV(e). Article V sets forth conditions on the receiving State obtaining temporary custody of the prisoner. The remaining articles deal with subsidiary matters, not relevant here with one exception: Article IX provides that the \"agreement shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes.\"\r~    \r~    \r~      9\r~      For present purposes, it is important to keep in mind that the Agreement basically (1) gives a prisoner the right to demand a trial within 180 days; and (2) gives a State the right to obtain a prisoner for purposes of trial, in which case the State (a) must try the prisoner within 120 days of his arrival, and (b) must not return the prisoner to his \"original place of imprisonment\" prior to that trial.\r~    \r~    B\r~    \r~      10\r~      In January 1997, respondent Michael Bozeman was serving a sentence of imprisonment for a federal drug crime in federal prison in Marianna, Florida. At the beginning of that month, the district attorney of Covington County, Alabama, who had earlier lodged a detainer against Bozeman in connection with charges related to discharging firearms, sought temporary custody in order to arraign Bozeman on those firearms charges and secure the appointment of counsel. On January 23, federal authorities released Bozeman to local officials. Those officials took him to Covington County, about 80 miles from the federal prison, where he arrived later in the day. Bozeman spent the night in the county jail, appeared in local court the next morning, obtained local appointed counsel, and was transported back to federal prison that evening. About one month later, Bozeman was brought back to Covington County for trial.\r~    \r~    \r~      11\r~      At that time, Bozeman's local counsel filed a motion to dismiss the state charges on the ground that in January Bozeman had been \"returned to the original place of imprisonment\" (namely, the federal prison) \"prior to\" \"trial\" on state charges being \"had.\" See App. 37-42. Consequently, he argued, under Article IV(e) the state charges were without \"any further force or effect,\" and the local court had to \"enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.\"\r~    \r~    \r~      12\r~      Bozeman was convicted, and the trial court subsequently denied Bozeman's motion for dismissal. It wrote that it \"made much sense to bring\" Bozeman \"into the county briefly\" to deal with \"short pre-trial matters\" and then to \"return him to the surroundings to which he was accustomed.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a. Doing so furthered Bozeman's \"interest in maintaining . . . rehabilitation available to him in federal prison.\" Ibid. In the trial judge's view, Bozeman \"certainly would not [have] receive[d] much rehabilitation in a county jail.\" Ibid. Consequently, the judge concluded, the January transfer was \"wholly consistent with\" the Agreement's goal, \"to expedite the prosecution of state charges without interfering with any rehabilitative programs of the federal government.\" Id., at 29a.\r~    \r~    \r~      13\r~      An intermediate State Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction. 738 So. 2d 934 (1998). But the Alabama State Supreme Court reversed by a 4-to-3 vote. 781 So. 2d 165 (2000). In its view, the literal language of the Agreement controlled and required dismissal of the state charges. The dissenters argued that the Agreement violation was merely \"technical,\" and consequently did not require dismissal. Id., at 170. The State petitioned for certiorari. In light of differences among the lower courts, we granted the writ. Compare, e.g., United States v. Schrum, 638 F.2d 214, 215 (CA10 1981) (per curiam) (adopting District Court's literal interpretation of Agreement), with United States v. Daniels, 3 F.3d 25, 27-28 (CA1 1993) (rejecting literal interpretation of Agreement). And we now affirm the Alabama Supreme Court's decision.\r~    \r~    II\r~    \r~      14\r~      Alabama does not deny a violation of Article IV(e) as literally interpreted, for it concedes that its officials \"returned\" Bozeman to his \"original place of imprisonment,\" before Bozeman's county court \"trial\" was \"had.\" Nor does Alabama claim that Bozeman waived the right to trial before return that Article IV provides. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 1, n. 1. Cf. Hill, 528 U.S., at 114-115 (holding that defendant may waive his rights under Art. III of the Agreement). Rather, Alabama, supported by the United States Solicitor General and others, claims that Article IV(e)'s basic purpose is to prevent shuttling that would interrupt the prisoner's rehabilitation. See, e.g., United States v. Roy, 830 F.2d 628, 636 (CA7 1987) (provision is \"meant to protect the prisoner against endless interruption of the rehabilitation programs because of criminal proceedings in other jurisdictions\"). They say the one-day interruption that occurred here did not interrupt rehabilitation significantly. Hence, any violation is \"technical,\" \"harmless,\" or \"de minimis.\" And Article IV(e) contains an implicit exception for such trivial violations. Brief for Petitioner 26; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12-13. Cf. Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue v. William Wrigley, Jr., Co., 505 U.S. 214, 231 (1992) (laws ordinarily are enacted with understanding that de minimis exceptions will be recognized). We cannot accept this argument, however, for two reasons.\r~    \r~    \r~      15\r~      * First, the language of the Agreement militates against an implicit exception, for it is absolute. It says that, when a prisoner is \"returned\" before trial, the indictment, information, or complaint \"shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.\" Art. IV(e) (emphasis added). \"The word 'shall' is ordinarily 'the language of command.' \" Anderson v. Yungkau, 329 U.S. 482, 485 (1947) (quoting Escoe v. Zerbst, 295 U.S. 490, 493 (1935)).\r~    \r~    \r~      16\r~      The cases Alabama cites as supporting a \"harmless error\" construction involved statutes that lacked this absolute language. See, e.g., United States v. Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U.S. 711, 716-717 (1990) (Bail Reform Act \"is silent on the issue of a remedy for violations of its time limits\"). Cf. William Wrigley, Jr., supra, at 231-232 (applying \"de minimis exception\" presumption as \"part of the established background of legal principles against which all enactments are adopted,\" where text did not provide a \"contrary indication\").\r~    \r~    \r~      17\r~      Moreover, the Agreement makes no distinction among different kinds of IV(c) \"arrivals,\" say, by exempting those that are followed by return within a short, specified period of time, or those that are simply for the purpose of arraignment. Given the Agreement's language and the important consequences of starting the running of the 120-day time limit, we see no basis for such a distinction. Hence, we must assume that every prisoner arrival in the receiving State, whether followed by a very brief stay or a very long stay in the receiving State, triggers IV(e)'s \"no return\" requirement.\r~    \r~    B\r~    \r~      18\r~      Second, even were we to assume for argument's sake that the Agreement exempts violations that, viewed in terms of the Agreement's purposes, are de minimis, cf. Article IX (stating that Agreement \"shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes\"), we could not say that the violation at issue here qualifies as trivial. That is because the purpose of the \"no return\" provision cannot be as Alabama and the Solicitor General describe it, namely, as a simple, direct effort to prevent the interruption of rehabilitation. A provision that prevents returning a prisoner who has arrived in the receiving State does not directly increase the number of days the prisoner will spend in rehabilitation in the sending State. Rather, it directly and intentionally decreases the number of days that prisoner will spend in the sending State.\r~    \r~    \r~      19\r~      This point is obvious once one keeps in mind that the trial must take place within 120 days of the prisoner's arrival in the receiving State. Article IV(e)'s requirement that the prisoner remain in the county jail means that the prisoner will spend all of those 120 days away from the sending State's rehabilitation programs. By contrast, returning the prisoner prior to trial-in violation of Article IV(e)-would permit the prisoner to participate in the sending State's program for some of those days. But to call such a violation \"technical,\" because it means fewer days spent away from the sending State, is to call virtually every conceivable antishuttling violation \"technical\"-a circumstance which, like the 13th chime of the clock, shows that Alabama's conception of the provision's purpose is seriously flawed.\r~    \r~    \r~      20\r~      Article IV(e) may seek to remove obstructions to prisoner rehabilitation in a different way. The Agreement not only prevents \"return,\" but it also requires the receiving State to pay for the prisoner's incarceration in that State during the period prior to trial. Art. V(h) (\"From the time that a party State receives custody of a prisoner pursuant to this agreement until such prisoner is returned to the territory and custody of the sending State, the [receiving] State ... shall be responsible for the prisoner and shall also pay all costs of transporting, caring for, keeping, and returning the prisoner\"). That requirement may provide the receiving State with an incentive to shorten the pretrial period-to proceed to trial faster than 120 days or not to seek extensions-thus disposing of detainers, and the attendant \"uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation,\" in the most \"expeditious\" manner. Art. I. See also Cuyler, 449 U.S., at 449 (discussing negative effects of detainers on prisoners). But if that is Article IV(e)'s purpose, the transfer here was inconsistent with it. By returning Bozeman to federal prison, the county saved itself the cost of housing him- and for a nontrivial several week period, which may have allowed it to delay resolving the detainer.\r~    \r~    \r~      21\r~      Alternatively, the Agreement's drafters may have thought that the \"shuttling\" itself, i.e., the movement back and forth among prisons, adds to the \"uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation.\" Art. I (emphasis added). And they may have sought to minimize the number of \"shuttles\" for that reason alone.\r~    \r~    \r~      22\r~      Viewing the Agreement in terms of either purpose, we cannot say that the one-day violation here is de mimimis, technical, or harmless. Neither do the briefs (or, to our knowledge, any lower court opinion) point to any other plausible rehabilitation-related purpose of Article IV(e) specifically, in terms of which the violation here might count as trivial. But we need not decide precisely what led Congress and the many other legislatures to agree to Article IV(e)'s antishuttling remedy. Given the Agreement's absolute language, it is enough to explain why Alabama's view of the Agreement's purpose is not plausible and to point to other purposes more easily squared with Article IV(e)'s text and operation.\r~    \r~    C\r~    \r~      23\r~      Alabama and amici make additional claims, basically elaborating on the trial court's view that return to the sending State after a brief journey to the receiving State for pretrial purposes is helpful, not harmful, to the prisoner. But given Article IV's text, which indicates a contrary view, the parties would more appropriately address these policy arguments to legislatures.\r~    \r~    \r~      24\r~      The Solicitor General also points to a federal statutory provision that says expressly that an \"order of a court dismissing any indictment, information, or complaint may be with or without prejudice,\" depending on the \"seriousness of the offense,\" the \"facts and circumstances of the case,\" and the \"impact of a reprosecution on the administration of the agreement\" and \"on the administration of justice.\" 18 U.S.C. App. 9(1), p. 695. This statutory provision, however, governs only when \"the United States is a receiving State.\" 9. And here the United States is not the receiving State. We fail to see how this provision helps, rather than hurts, Alabama's cause. Although we reject Alabama's interpretation of the Agreement, our decision does not bar a receiving State from returning a prisoner when it would be mutually advantageous and the prisoner accordingly waives his rights under Article IV(e). Cf. Hill, 528 U.S., at 114-115 (holding that defendant may waive his rights under Art. III of the Agreement)\r~    \r~    \r~      25\r~      For these reasons, the judgment of the Alabama Supreme Court is affirmed.\r~    \r~    \r~      26\r~      It is so ordered.\r~    \r~    \r~      \r~        NOTES:\r~      \r~      \r~        *\r~         Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas join all but Part II-B of this opinion.\r~      \r~    \r~    ",

Readers are requested to notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D. C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.GOOD NEWS CLUB, et al., PETITIONERSv.MILFORD CENTRAL SCHOOL~    No. 99-2036.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued February 28, 2001Decided June 11, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      Under New York law, respondent Milford Central School (Milford) enacted a policy authorizing district residents to use its building after school for, among other things, (1) instruction in education, learning, or the arts and (2) social, civic, recreational, and entertainment uses pertaining to the community welfare. Stephen and Darleen Fournier, district residents eligible to use the school's facilities upon approval of their proposed use, are sponsors of the Good News Club, a private Christian organization for children ages 6 to 12. Pursuant to Milford's policy, they submitted a request to hold the Club's weekly afterschool meetings in the school. Milford denied the request on the ground that the proposed use-to sing songs, hear Bible lessons, memorize scripture, and pray-was the equivalent of religious worship prohibited by the community use policy. Petitioners (collectively, the Club), filed suit under 42 U.S.C.  1983 alleging, inter alia, that the denial of the Club's application violated its free speech rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court ultimately granted Milford summary judgment, finding the Club's subject matter to be religious in nature, not merely a discussion of secular matters from a religious perspective that Milford otherwise permits. Because the school had not allowed other groups providing religious instruction to use its limited public forum, the court held that it could deny the Club access without engaging in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination. In affirming, the Second Circuit rejected the Club's contention that Milford's restriction was unreasonable, and held that, because the Club's subject matter was quintessentially religious and its activities fell outside the bounds of pure moral and character development, Milford's policy was constitutional subject discrimination, not unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.~      Held:   1. Milford violated the Club's free speech rights when it excluded the Club from meeting after hours at the school. Pp. 5-11.~      (a) Because the parties so agree, this Court assumes that Milford operates a limited public forum. A State establishing such a forum is not required to and does not allow persons to engage in every type of speech. It may be justified in reserving its forum for certain groups or the discussion of certain topics. E.g., Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 829. The power to so restrict speech, however, is not without limits. The restriction must not discriminate against speech based on viewpoint, ibid., and must be reasonable in light of the forum's purpose, Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense  Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 806. Pp. 5-6.~      (b) By denying the Club access to the school's limited public forum on the ground that the Club was religious in nature, Milford discriminated against the Club because of its religious viewpoint in violation of the Free Speech Clause. That exclusion is indistinguishable from the exclusions held violative of the Clause in Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. 384, where a school district precluded a private group from presenting films at the school based solely on the religious perspective of the films, and in Rosenberger, where a university refused to fund a student publication because it addressed issues from a religious perspective. The only apparent difference between the activities of Lamb's Chapel and the Club is the inconsequential distinction that the Club teaches moral lessons from a Christian perspective through live storytelling and prayer, whereas Lamb's Chapel taught lessons through films. Rosenberger also is dispositive: Given the obvious religious content of the publication there at issue, it cannot be said that the Club's activities are any more \"religious\" or deserve any less Free Speech Clause protection. This Court disagrees with the Second Circuit's view that something that is quintessentially religious or decidedly religious in nature cannot also be characterized properly as the teaching of morals and character development from a particular viewpoint. What matters for Free Speech Clause purposes is that there is no logical difference in kind between the invocation of Christianity by the Club and the invocation of teamwork, loyalty, or patriotism by other associations to provide a foundation for their lessons. Because Milford's restriction is viewpoint discriminatory, the Court need not decide whether it is unreasonable in light of the forum's purposes. Pp. 6-11.~      2. Permitting the Club to meet on the school's premises would not have violated the Establishment Clause. Establishment Clause defenses similar to Milford's were rejected in Lamb's Chapel, supra, at 395-where the Court found that, because the films would not have been shown during school hours, would not have been sponsored by the school, and would have been open to the public, not just to church members, there was no realistic danger that the community would think that the district was endorsing religion-and in Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 272-273, and n. 13-where a university's forum was already available to other groups. Because the Club's activities are materially indistinguishable from those in Lamb's Chapel and Widmar, Milford's reliance on the Establishment Clause is unavailing. As in Lamb's Chapel, the Club's meetings were to be held after school hours, not sponsored by the school, and open to any student who obtained parental consent, not just to Club members. As in Widmar, Milford made its forum available to other organizations. The Court rejects Milford's attempt to distinguish those cases by emphasizing that its policy involves elementary school children who will perceive that the school is endorsing the Club and will feel coerced to participate because the Club's activities take place on school grounds, even though they occur during nonschool hours. That argument is unpersuasive for a number of reasons. (1) Allowing the Club to speak on school grounds would ensure, not threaten, neutrality toward religion. Accordingly, Milford faces an uphill battle in arguing that the Establishment Clause compels it to exclude the Club. See, e.g., Rosenberger, supra, at 839. (2) To the extent the Court considers whether the community would feel coercive pressure to engage in the Club's activities, cf. Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577, 592-593, the relevant community is the parents who choose whether their children will attend Club meetings, not the children themselves. (3) Whatever significance it may have assigned in the Establishment Clause context to the suggestion that elementary school children are more impressionable than adults, cf., e.g., id., at 592, the Court has never foreclosed private religious conduct during nonschool hours merely because it takes place on school premises where elementary school children may be present. Lee, supra, at 592, and Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578, 584, distinguished. (4) Even if the Court were to consider the possible misperceptions by schoolchildren in deciding whether there is an Establishment Clause violation, the facts of this case simply do not support Milford's conclusion. Finally, it cannot be said that the danger that children would misperceive the endorsement of religion is any greater than the danger that they would perceive a hostility toward the religious viewpoint if the Club were excluded from the public forum. Because it is not convinced that there is any significance to the possibility that elementary school children may witness the Club's activities on school premises, the Court can find no reason to depart from Lamb's Chapel and Widmar. Pp. 12-20.~      3. Because Milford has not raised a valid Establishment Clause claim, this Court does not address whether such a claim could excuse Milford's viewpoint discrimination. Pp. 12, 20.~      202 F.3d 502, reversed and remanded.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT~      Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor, Scalia, and Kennedy, JJ., joined, and in which Breyer, JJ., joined in part.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      This case presents two questions. The first question is whether Milford Central School violated the free speech rights of the Good News Club when it excluded the Club from meeting after hours at the school. The second question is whether any such violation is justified by Milford's concern that permitting the Club's activities would violate the Establishment Clause. We conclude that Milford's restriction violates the Club's free speech rights and that no Establishment Clause concern justifies that violation.~    ~    ~      2~      * The State of New York authorizes local school boards to adopt regulations governing the use of their school facilities. In particular, N. Y. Educ. Law 414 (McKinney 2000) enumerates several purposes for which local boards may open their schools to public use. In 1992, respondent Milford Central School (Milford) enacted a community use policy adopting seven of 414's purposes for which its building could be used after school. App. to Pet. for Cert. D1-D3. Two of the stated purposes are relevant here. First, district residents may use the school for \"instruction in any branch of education, learning or the arts.\" Id., at D1. Second, the school is available for \"social, civic and recreational meetings and entertainment events, and other uses pertaining to the welfare of the community, provided that such uses shall be nonexclusive and shall be opened to the general public.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      3~      Stephen and Darleen Fournier reside within Milford's district and therefore are eligible to use the school's facilities as long as their proposed use is approved by the school. Together they are sponsors of the local Good News Club, a private Christian organization for children ages 6 to 12. Pursuant to Milford's policy, in September 1996 the Fourniers submitted a request to Dr. Robert McGruder, interim superintendent of the district, in which they sought permission to hold the Club's weekly afterschool meetings in the school cafeteria. App. in No. 98-9494 (CA2), p. A-81. The next month, McGruder formally denied the Fourniers' request on the ground that the proposed use-to have \"a fun time of singing songs, hearing a Bible lesson and memorizing scripture,\" ibid.-was \"the equivalent of religious worship.\" App. H1-H2. According to McGruder, the community use policy, which prohibits use \"by any individual or organization for religious purposes,\" foreclosed the Club's activities. App. to Pet. for Cert. D2.~    ~    ~      4~      In response to a letter submitted by the Club's counsel, Milford's attorney requested information to clarify the nature of the Club's activities. The Club sent a set of materials used or distributed at the meetings and the following description of its meeting:~    ~    ~      5~      \"The Club opens its session with Ms. Fournier taking attendance. As she calls a child's name, if the child recites a Bible verse the child receives a treat. After attendance, the Club sings songs. Next Club members engage in games that involve, inter alia, learning Bible verses. Ms. Fournier then relates a Bible story and explains how it applies to Club members' lives. The Club closes with prayer. Finally, Ms. Fournier distributes treats and the Bible verses for memorization.\" App. in No. 98-9494 (CA2), at A30.~    ~    ~      6~      McGruder and Milford's attorney reviewed the materials and concluded that \"the kinds of activities proposed to be engaged in by the Good News Club were not a discussion of secular subjects such as child rearing, development of character and development of morals from a religious perspective, but were in fact the equivalent of religious instruction itself.\" Id., at A25. In February 1997, the Milford Board of Education adopted a resolution rejecting the Club's request to use Milford's facilities \"for the purpose of conducting religious instruction and Bible study.\" Id., at A56.~    ~    ~      7~      In March 1997, petitioners, the Good News Club, Ms. Fournier, and her daughter Andrea Fournier (collectively, the Club), filed an action under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against Milford in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. The Club alleged that Milford's denial of its application violated its free speech rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, its right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment, and its right to religious freedom under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, 107 Stat. 1488, 42 U.S.C.  2000bb et seq.1~    ~    ~      8~      The Club moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent the school from enforcing its religious exclusion policy against the Club and thereby to permit the Club's use of the school facilities. On April 14, 1997, the District Court granted the injunction. The Club then held its weekly afterschool meetings from April 1997 until June 1998 in a high school resource and middle school special education room. App. N12.~    ~    ~      9~      In August 1998, the District Court vacated the preliminary injunction and granted Milford's motion for summary judgment. 21 F. Supp. 2d 147 (NDNY 1998). The court found that the Club's \"subject matter is decidedly religious in nature, and not merely a discussion of secular matters from a religious perspective that is otherwise permitted under [Milford's] use policies.\" Id., at 154. Because the school had not permitted other groups that provided religious instruction to use its limited public forum, the court held that the school could deny access to the Club without engaging in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination. The court also rejected the Club's equal protection claim.~    ~    ~      10~      The Club appealed, and a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. 202 F.3d 502 (2000). First, the court rejected the Club's contention that Milford's restriction against allowing religious instruction in its facilities is unreasonable. Second, it held that, because the subject matter of the Club's activities is \"quintessentially religious,\" id., at 510, and the activities \"fall outside the bounds of pure 'moral and character development,' \" id., at 511, Milford's policy of excluding the Club's meetings was constitutional subject discrimination, not unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination. Judge Jacobs filed a dissenting opinion in which he concluded that the school's restriction did constitute viewpoint discrimination under Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. 384 (1993).~    ~    ~      11~      There is a conflict among the Courts of Appeals on the question whether speech can be excluded from a limited public forum on the basis of the religious nature of the speech. Compare Gentala v. Tucson, 244 F.3d 1065 (CA9 2001) (en banc) (holding that a city properly refused National Day of Prayer organizers' application to the city's civic events fund for coverage of costs for city services); Campbell v. St. Tammany's School Bd., 206 F.3d 482 (CA5 2000) (holding that a school's policy against permitting religious instruction in its limited public forum did not constitute viewpoint discrimination), cert. pending, No. 00-1194; Bronx Household of Faith v. Community School Dist. No. 10, 127 F.3d 207 (CA2 1997) (concluding that a ban on religious services and instruction in the limited public forum was constitutional), with Church on the Rock v. Albuquerque, 84 F.3d 1273 (CA10 1996) (holding that a city's denial of permission to show the film Jesus in a senior center was unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination); and Good News/Good Sports Club v. School Dist. of Ladue, 28 F.3d 1501 (CA8 1994) (holding unconstitutional a school use policy that prohibited Good News Club from meeting during times when the Boy Scouts could meet). We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict. 531 U.S. 923 (2000).~    ~    II~    ~      12~      The standards that we apply to determine whether a State has unconstitutionally excluded a private speaker from use of a public forum depend on the nature of the forum. See Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 44 (1983). If the forum is a traditional or open public forum, the State's restrictions on speech are subject to stricter scrutiny than are restrictions in a limited public forum. Id., at 45-46. We have previously declined to decide whether a school district's opening of its facilities pursuant to N. Y. Educ. Law 414 creates a limited or a traditional public forum. See Lamb's Chapel, supra, at 391-392. Because the parties have agreed that Milford created a limited public forum when it opened its facilities in 1992, see Brief for Petitioners 15-17; Brief for Respondent 26, we need not resolve the issue here. Instead, we simply will assume that Milford operates a limited public forum.~    ~    ~      13~      When the State establishes a limited public forum, the State is not required to and does not allow persons to engage in every type of speech. The State may be justified \"in reserving [its forum] for certain groups or for the discussion of certain topics.\" Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995); see also Lamb's Chapel, supra, at 392-393. The State's power to restrict speech, however, is not without limits. The restriction must not discriminate against speech on the basis of viewpoint, Rosenberger, supra, at 829, and the restriction must be \"reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum,\" Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense  Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 806 (1985).~    ~    III~    ~      14~      Applying this test, we first address whether the exclusion constituted viewpoint discrimination. We are guided in our analysis by two of our prior opinions, Lamb's Chapel and Rosenberger. In Lamb's Chapel, we held that a school district violated the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment when it excluded a private group from presenting films at the school based solely on the films' discussions of family values from a religious perspective. Likewise, in Rosenberger, we held that a university's refusal to fund a student publication because the publication addressed issues from a religious perspective violated the Free Speech Clause. Concluding that Milford's exclusion of the Good News Club based on its religious nature is indistinguishable from the exclusions in these cases, we hold that the exclusion constitutes viewpoint discrimination. Because the restriction is viewpoint discriminatory, we need not decide whether it is unreasonable in light of the purposes served by the forum.2~    ~    ~      15~      Milford has opened its limited public forum to activities that serve a variety of purposes, including events \"pertaining to the welfare of the community.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. D1. Milford interprets its policy to permit discussions of subjects such as child rearing, and of \"the development of character and morals from a religious perspective.\" Brief for Appellee in No. 98-9494 (CA2), p. 6. For example, this policy would allow someone to use Aesop's Fables to teach children moral values. App. N11. Additionally, a group could sponsor a debate on whether there should be a constitutional amendment to permit prayer in public schools, id., at N6, and the Boy Scouts could meet \"to influence a boy's character, development and spiritual growth,\" id., at N10-N11. In short, any group that \"promote[s] the moral and character development of children\" is eligible to use the school building. Brief for Appellee in No. 98-9494 (CA2), at 9.~    ~    ~      16~      Just as there is no question that teaching morals and character development to children is a permissible purpose under Milford's policy, it is clear that the Club teaches morals and character development to children. For example, no one disputes that the Club instructs children to overcome feelings of jealousy, to treat others well regardless of how they treat the children, and to be obedient, even if it does so in a nonsecular way. Nonetheless, because Milford found the Club's activities to be religious in nature-\"the equivalent of religious instruction itself,\" 202 F.3d, at 507-it excluded the Club from use of its facilities.~    ~    ~      17~      Applying Lamb's Chapel,3 we find it quite clear that Milford engaged in viewpoint discrimination when it excluded the Club from the afterschool forum. In Lamb's Chapel, the local New York school district similarly had adopted 414's \"social, civic or recreational use\" category as a permitted use in its limited public forum. The district also prohibited use \"by any group for religious purposes.\" 508 U.S., at 387. Citing this prohibition, the school district excluded a church that wanted to present films teaching family values from a Christian perspective. We held that, because the films \"no doubt dealt with a subject otherwise permissible\" under the rule, the teaching of family values, the district's exclusion of the church was unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination. Id., at 394.~    ~    ~      18~      Like the church in Lamb's Chapel, the Club seeks to address a subject otherwise permitted under the rule, the teaching of morals and character, from a religious standpoint. Certainly, one could have characterized the film presentations in Lamb's Chapel as a religious use, as the Court of Appeals did, Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 959 F.2d 381, 388-389 (CA2 1992). And one easily could conclude that the films' purpose to instruct that \" 'society's slide toward humanism ... can only be counterbalanced by a loving home where Christian values are instilled from an early age,' \" id., at 384, was \"quintessentially religious,\" 202 F.3d, at 510. The only apparent difference between the activity of Lamb's Chapel and the activities of the Good News Club is that the Club chooses to teach moral lessons from a Christian perspective through live storytelling and prayer, whereas Lamb's Chapel taught lessons through films. This distinction is inconsequential. Both modes of speech use a religious viewpoint. Thus, the exclusion of the Good News Club's activities, like the exclusion of Lamb's Chapel's films, constitutes unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.~    ~    ~      19~      Our opinion in Rosenberger also is dispositive. In Rosenberger, a student organization at the University of Virginia was denied funding for printing expenses because its publication, Wide Awake, offered a Christian viewpoint. Just as the Club emphasizes the role of Christianity in students' morals and character, Wide Awake \" 'challenge[d] Christians to live, in word and deed, according to the faith they proclaim and ... encourage[d] students to consider what a personal relationship with Jesus Christ means.' \" 515 U.S., at 826. Because the university \"select[ed] for disfavored treatment those student journalistic efforts with religious editorial viewpoints,\" we held that the denial of funding was unconstitutional. Id., at 831. Although in Rosenberger there was no prohibition on religion as a subject matter, our holding did not rely on this factor. Instead, we concluded simply that the university's denial of funding to print Wide Awake was viewpoint discrimination, just as the school district's refusal to allow Lamb's Chapel to show its films was viewpoint discrimination. Ibid. Given the obvious religious content of Wide Awake, we cannot say that the Club's activities are any more \"religious\" or deserve any less First Amendment protection than did the publication of Wide Awake in Rosenberger.~    ~    ~      20~      Despite our holdings in Lamb's Chapel and Rosenberger, the Court of Appeals, like Milford, believed that its characterization of the Club's activities as religious in nature warranted treating the Club's activities as different in kind from the other activities permitted by the school. See 202 F.3d, at 510 (the Club \"is doing something other than simply teaching moral values\"). The \"Christian viewpoint\" is unique, according to the court, because it contains an \"additional layer\" that other kinds of viewpoints do not. Id., at 509. That is, the Club \"is focused on teaching children how to cultivate their relationship with God through Jesus Christ,\" which it characterized as \"quintessentially religious.\" Id., at 510. With these observations, the court concluded that, because the Club's activities \"fall outside the bounds of pure 'moral and character development,' \" the exclusion did not constitute viewpoint discrimination. Id., at 511.~    ~    ~      21~      We disagree that something that is \"quintessentially religious\" or \"decidedly religious in nature\" cannot also be characterized properly as the teaching of morals and character development from a particular viewpoint. See 202 F.3d, at 512 (Jacobs, J., dissenting) (\"[W]hen the subject matter is morals and character, it is quixotic to attempt a distinction between religious viewpoints and religious subject matters\"). What matters for purposes of the Free Speech Clause is that we can see no logical difference in kind between the invocation of Christianity by the Club and the invocation of teamwork, loyalty, or patriotism by other associations to provide a foundation for their lessons. It is apparent that the unstated principle of the Court of Appeals' reasoning is its conclusion that any time religious instruction and prayer are used to discuss morals and character, the discussion is simply not a \"pure\" discussion of those issues. According to the Court of Appeals, reliance on Christian principles taints moral and character instruction in a way that other foundations for thought or viewpoints do not. We, however, have never reached such a conclusion. Instead, we reaffirm our holdings in Lamb's Chapel and Rosenberger that speech discussing otherwise permissible subjects cannot be excluded from a limited public forum on the ground that the subject is discussed from a religious viewpoint. Thus, we conclude that Milford's exclusion of the Club from use of the school, pursuant to its community use policy, constitutes impermissible viewpoint discrimination.4~    ~    IV~    ~      22~      Milford argues that, even if its restriction constitutes viewpoint discrimination, its interest in not violating the Establishment Clause outweighs the Club's interest in gaining equal access to the school's facilities. In other words, according to Milford, its restriction was required to avoid violating the Establishment Clause. We disagree.~    ~    ~      23~      We have said that a state interest in avoiding an Establishment Clause violation \"may be characterized as compelling,\" and therefore may justify content-based discrimination. Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 271 (1981). However, it is not clear whether a State's interest in avoiding an Establishment Clause violation would justify viewpoint discrimination. See Lamb's Chapel, 508 U.S., at 394-395 (noting the suggestion in Widmar but ultimately not finding an Establishment Clause problem). We need not, however, confront the issue in this case, because we conclude that the school has no valid Establishment Clause interest.~    ~    ~      24~      We rejected Establishment Clause defenses similar to Milford's in two previous free speech cases, Lamb's Chapel and Widmar. In particular, in Lamb's Chapel, we explained that \"[t]he showing of th[e] film series would not have been during school hours, would not have been sponsored by the school, and would have been open to the public, not just to church members.\" 508 U.S., at 395. Accordingly, we found that \"there would have been no realistic danger that the community would think that the District was endorsing religion or any particular creed.\" Ibid. Likewise, in Widmar, where the university's forum was already available to other groups, this Court concluded that there was no Establishment Clause problem. 454 U.S., at 272-273, and n. 13.~    ~    ~      25~      The Establishment Clause defense fares no better in this case. As in Lamb's Chapel, the Club's meetings were held after school hours, not sponsored by the school, and open to any student who obtained parental consent, not just to Club members. As in Widmar, Milford made its forum available to other organizations. The Club's activities are materially indistiguishable from those in Lamb's Chapel and Widmar. Thus, Milford's reliance on the Establishment Clause is unavailing.~    ~    ~      26~      Milford attempts to distinguish Lamb's Chapel and Widmar by emphasizing that Milford's policy involves elementary school children. According to Milford, children will perceive that the school is endorsing the Club and will feel coercive pressure to participate, because the Club's activities take place on school grounds, even though they occur during nonschool hours.5 This argument is unpersuasive.~    ~    ~      27~      First, we have held that \"a significant factor in upholding governmental programs in the face of Establishment Clause attack is their neutrality towards religion.\" Rosenberger, 515 U.S., at 839 (emphasis added). See also Mitchell v. Helms, 530 U.S. 793, (2000) (slip op., at 10) (plurality opinion) (\"In distinguishing between indoctrination that is attributable to the State and indoctrination that is not, [the Court has] consistently turned to the principle of neutrality, upholding aid that is offered to a broad range of groups or persons without regard to their religion\" (emphasis added)); id., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (\"[N]eutrality is an important reason for upholding government-aid programs against Establishment Clause challenges\"). Milford's implication that granting access to the Club would do damage to the neutrality principle defies logic. For the \"guarantee of neutrality is respected, not offended, when the government, following neutral criteria and evenhanded policies, extends benefits to recipients whose ideologies and viewpoints, including religious ones, are broad and diverse.\" Rosenberger, supra, at 839. The Good News Club seeks nothing more than to be treated neutrally and given access to speak about the same topics as are other groups. Because allowing the Club to speak on school grounds would ensure neutrality, not threaten it, Milford faces an uphill battle in arguing that the Establishment Clause compels it to exclude the Good News Club.~    ~    ~      28~      Second, to the extent we consider whether the community would feel coercive pressure to engage in the Club's activities, cf. Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577, 592-593 (1992), the relevant community would be the parents, not the elementary school children. It is the parents who choose whether their children will attend the Good News Club meetings. Because the children cannot attend without their parents' permission, they cannot be coerced into engaging in the Good News Club's religious activities. Milford does not suggest that the parents of elementary school children would be confused about whether the school was endorsing religion. Nor do we believe that such an argument could be reasonably advanced.~    ~    ~      29~      Third, whatever significance we may have assigned in the Establishment Clause context to the suggestion that elementary school children are more impressionable than adults, cf., e.g., Lee, supra, at 592; School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U.S. 373, 390 (1985) (stating that \"symbolism of a union between church and state is most likely to influence children of tender years, whose experience is limited and whose beliefs consequently are the function of environment as much as of free and voluntary choice\"), we have never extended our Establishment Clause jurisprudence to foreclose private religious conduct during nonschool hours merely because it takes place on school premises where elementary school children may be present.~    ~    ~      30~      None of the cases discussed by Milford persuades us that our Establishment Clause jurisprudence has gone this far. For example, Milford cites Lee v. Weisman for the proposition that \"there are heightened concerns with protecting freedom of conscience from subtle coercive pressure in the elementary and secondary public schools,\" 505 U.S., at 592. In Lee, however, we concluded that attendance at the graduation exercise was obligatory. Id., at 586. See also Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe, 530 U.S. 290 (2000) (holding the school's policy of permitting prayer at football games unconstitutional where the activity took place during a school-sponsored event and not in a public forum). We did not place independent significance on the fact that the graduation exercise might take place on school premises, Lee, supra, at 583. Here, where the school facilities are being used for a nonschool function and there is no government sponsorship of the Club's activities, Lee is inapposite.~    ~    ~      31~      Equally unsupportive is Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578 (1987), in which we held that a Louisiana law that proscribed the teaching of evolution as part of the public school curriculum, unless accompanied by a lesson on creationism, violated the Establishment Clause. In Edwards, we mentioned that students are susceptible to pressure in the classroom, particularly given their possible reliance on teachers as role models. See id., at 584. But we did not discuss this concern in our application of the law to the facts. Moreover, we did note that mandatory attendance requirements meant that State advancement of religion in a school would be particularly harshly felt by impressionable students.6 But we did not suggest that, when the school was not actually advancing religion, the impressionability of students would be relevant to the Establishment Clause issue. Even if Edwards had articulated the principle Milford believes it did, the facts in Edwards are simply too remote from those here to give the principle any weight. Edwards involved the content of the curriculum taught by state teachers during the schoolday to children required to attend. Obviously, when individuals who are not schoolteachers are giving lessons after school to children permitted to attend only with parental consent, the concerns expressed in Edwards are not present.7~    ~    ~      32~      Fourth, even if we were to consider the possible misperceptions by schoolchildren in deciding whether Milford's permitting the Club's activities would violate the Establishment Clause, the facts of this case simply do not support Milford's conclusion. There is no evidence that young children are permitted to loiter outside classrooms after the schoolday has ended. Surely even young children are aware of events for which their parents must sign permission forms. The meetings were held in a combined high school resource room and middle school special education room, not in an elementary school classroom. The instructors are not schoolteachers. And the children in the group are not all the same age as in the normal classroom setting; their ages range from 6 to 12.8 In sum, these circumstances simply do not support the theory that small children would perceive endorsement here.~    ~    ~      33~      Finally, even if we were to inquire into the minds of schoolchildren in this case, we cannot say the danger that children would misperceive the endorsement of religion is any greater than the danger that they would perceive a hostility toward the religious viewpoint if the Club were excluded from the public forum. This concern is particularly acute given the reality that Milford's building is not used only for elementary school children. Students, from kindergarten through the 12th grade, all attend school in the same building. There may be as many, if not more, upperclassmen than elementary school children who occupy the school after hours. For that matter, members of the public writ large are permitted in the school after hours pursuant to the community use policy. Any bystander could conceivably be aware of the school's use policy and its exclusion of the Good News Club, and could suffer as much from viewpoint discrimination as elementary school children could suffer from perceived endorsement. Cf. Rosenberger, 515 U.S., at 835-836 (expressing the concern that viewpoint discrimination can chill individual thought and expression).~    ~    ~      34~      We cannot operate, as Milford would have us do, under the assumption that any risk that small children would perceive endorsement should counsel in favor of excluding the Club's religious activity. We decline to employ Establishment Clause jurisprudence using a modified heckler's veto, in which a group's religious activity can be proscribed on the basis of what the youngest members of the audience might misperceive. Cf. Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U.S. 753, 779-780 (1995) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\"[B]ecause our concern is with the political community writ large, the endorsement inquiry is not about the perceptions of particular individuals or saving isolated nonadherents from ... discomfort ... . It is for this reason that the reasonable observer in the endorsement inquiry must be deemed aware of the history and context of the community and forum in which the religious [speech takes place]\" (emphasis added)). There are countervailing constitutional concerns related to rights of other individuals in the community. In this case, those countervailing concerns are the free speech rights of the Club and its members. Cf. Rosenberger, supra, at 835 (\"Vital First Amendment speech principles are at stake here\"). And, we have already found that those rights have been violated, not merely perceived to have been violated, by the school's actions toward the Club.~    ~    ~      35~      We are not convinced that there is any significance in this case to the possibility that elementary school children may witness the Good News Club's activities on school premises, and therefore we can find no reason to depart from our holdings in Lamb's Chapel and Widmar. Accordingly, we conclude that permitting the Club to meet on the school's premises would not have violated the Establishment Clause.9~    ~    V~    ~      36~      When Milford denied the Good News Club access to the school's limited public forum on the ground that the Club was religious in nature, it discriminated against the Club because of its religious viewpoint in violation of the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. Because Milford has not raised a valid Establishment Clause claim, we do not address the question whether such a claim could excuse Milford's viewpoint discrimination.~    ~    ~      37~      * * *~    ~    ~      38~      The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      39~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      40~      Scalia, J., filed a concurring opinion.~    ~    ~      41~      Breyer, J., filed an opinion concurring in part.~    ~    ~      42~      Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion.~    ~    ~      43~      Souter, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Ginsburg, J., joined.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         The District Court dismissed the Club's claim under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act because we held the Act to be unconstitutional in City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507 (1997). See 21 F. Supp. 2d 147, 150, n. 4 (NDNY 1998).~      ~      ~        2~         Although Milford argued below that, under 414, it could not permit its property to be used for the purpose of religious activity, see Brief for Appellee in No. 98-9494 (CA2), p. 12, here it merely asserts in one sentence that it has, \"in accordance with state law, closed [its] limited open forum to purely religious instruction and services,\" Brief for Respondent 27. Because Milford does not elaborate, it is difficult to discern whether it is arguing that it is required by state law to exclude the Club's activities.   Before the Court of Appeals, Milford cited Trietley v. Board of Ed. of Buffalo, 65 App. Div. 2d 1, 409 N. Y. S. 2d 912 (1978), in which a New York court held that a local school district could not permit a student Bible club to meet on school property because \"[r]eligious purposes are not included in the enumerated purposes for which a school may be used under section 414 of the Education Law.\" Id., at 5-6, 409 N. Y. S. 2d, at 915. Although the court conceded that the Bible clubs might provide incidental secular benefits, it nonetheless concluded that the school would have violated the Establishment Clause had it permitted the club's activities on campus. Because we hold that the exclusion of the Club on the basis of its religious perspective constitutes unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination, it is no defense for Milford that purely religious purposes can be excluded under state law.~      ~      ~        3~         We find it remarkable that the Court of Appeals majority did not cite Lamb's Chapel, despite its obvious relevance to the case. We do not necessarily expect a court of appeals to catalog every opinion that reverses one of its precedents. Nonetheless, this oversight is particularly incredible because the majority's attention was directed to it at every turn. See, e.g., 202 F.3d 502, 513 (CA2 2000) (Jacobs, J., dissenting) (\"I cannot square the majority's analysis in this case with Lamb's Chapel\"); 21 F. Supp. 2d, at 150; App. O9-O11 (District Court stating \"that Lamb's Chapel and Rosenberger pinpoint the critical issue in this case\"); Brief for Appellee in No. 98-9494 (CA2) at 36-39; Brief for Appellants in No. 98-9494 (CA2), pp. 15, 36.~      ~      ~        4~         Despite Milford's insistence that the Club's activities constitute \"religious worship,\" the Court of Appeals made no such determination. It did compare the Club's activities to \"religious worship,\" 202 F.3d, at 510, but ultimately it concluded merely that the Club's activities \"fall outside the bounds of pure 'moral and character development,' \" id., at 511. In any event, we conclude that the Club's activities do not constitute mere religious worship, divorced from any teaching of moral values. Justice Souter's recitation of the Club's activities is accurate. See post, at 4-5 (opinion of Souter, J.). But in our view, religion is used by the Club in the same fashion that it was used by Lamb's Chapel and by the students in Rosenberger: religion is the viewpoint from which ideas are conveyed. We did not find the Rosenberger students' attempt to cultivate a personal relationship with Christ to bar their claim that religion was a viewpoint. And we see no reason to treat the Club's use of religion as something other than a viewpoint merely because of any evangelical message it conveys.   According to Justice Souter, the Club's activities constitute \"an evangelical service of worship.\" Post, at 5. Regardless of the label Justice Souter wishes to use, what matters is the substance of the Club's activities, which we conclude are materially indistinguishable from the activities in Lamb's Chapel and Rosenberger.~      ~      ~        5~         It is worth noting that, although Milford repeatedly has argued that the Club's meeting time directly after the schoolday is relevant to its Establishment Clause concerns, the record does not reflect any offer by the school district to permit the Club to use the facilities at a different time of day. The superintendent's stated reason for denying the applications was simply that the Club's activities were \"religious instruction.\" 202 F.3d, at 507. In any event, consistent with Lamb's Chapel and Widmar, the school could not deny equal access to the Club for any time that is generally available for public use.~      ~      ~        6~         Milford also cites Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Ed. of School Dist. No. 71, Champaign Cty., 333 U.S. 203 (1948), for its position that the Club's religious element would be advanced by the State through compulsory attendance laws. In McCollum, the school district excused students from their normal classroom study during the regular schoolday to attend classes taught by sectarian religious teachers, who were subject to approval by the school superintendent. Under these circumstances, this Court found it relevant that \"[t]he operation of the State's compulsory education system ... assist[ed] and [wa]s integrated with the program of religious instruction carried on by separate religious sects.\" Id., at 209. In the present case, there is simply no integration and cooperation between the school district and the Club. The Club's activities take place after the time when the children are compelled by state law to be at the school.~      ~      ~        7~         Milford also refers to Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226 (1990), to support its view that \"assumptions about the ability of students to make ... subtle distinctions [between schoolteachers during the schoolday and Reverend Fournier after school] are less valid for elementary age children who tend to be less informed, more impressionable, and more subject to peer pressure than average adults.\" Brief for Respondent 19. Four Justices in Mergens believed that high school students likely are capable of distinguishing between government and private endorsement of religion. See 496 U.S., at 250-251 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). The opinion, however, made no statement about how capable of discerning endorsement elementary school children would have been in the context of Mergens, where the activity at issue was after school. In any event, even to the extent elementary school children are more prone to peer pressure than are older children, it simply is not clear what, in this case, they could be pressured to do.~        In further support of the argument that the impressionability of elementary school children even after school is significant, Milford points to several cases in which we have found Establishment Clause violations in public schools. For example, Milford relies heavily on School Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203 (1963), in which we found unconstitutional Pennsylvania's practice of permitting public schools to read Bible verses at the opening of each schoolday. Schempp, however, is inapposite because this case does not involve activity by the school during the schoolday.~      ~      ~        8~         Milford also relies on the Equal Access Act, 98 Stat. 1302, 20 U.S.C.  4071-4074, as evidence that Congress has recognized the vulnerability of elementary school children to misperceiving endorsement of religion. The Act, however, makes no express recognition of the impressionability of elementary school children. It applies only to public secondary schools and makes no mention of elementary schools. 4071(a). We can derive no meaning from the choice by Congress not to address elementary schools.~      ~      ~        9~         Both parties have briefed the Establishment Clause issue extensively, and neither suggests that a remand would be of assistance on this issue. Although Justice Souter would prefer that a record be developed on several facts, see post, at 7, and Justice Breyer believes that development of those facts could yet be dispositive in this case, see post, at 2, none of these facts is relevant to the Establishment Clause inquiry. For example, Justice Souter suggests that we cannot determine whether there would be an Establishment Clause violation unless we know when, and to what extent, other groups use the facilities. When a limited public forum is available for use by groups presenting any viewpoint, however, we would not find an Establishment Clause violation simply because only groups presenting a religious viewpoint have opted to take advantage of the forum at a particular time.~      ~    ~    ~      44~      Justice Scalia, concurring.~    ~    ~      45~      I join the Court's opinion but write separately to explain further my views on two issues.~    ~    ~      46~      * First, I join Part IV of the Court's opinion, regarding the Establishment Clause issue, with the understanding that its consideration of coercive pressure, see ante, at 14, and perceptions of endorsement, see ante, at 14-15, 17-18, \"to the extent\" that the law makes such factors relevant, is consistent with the belief (which I hold) that in this case that extent is zero. As to coercive pressure: Physical coercion is not at issue here; and so-called \"peer pressure,\" if it can even been considered coercion, is, when it arises from private activities, one of the attendant consequences of a freedom of association that is constitutionally protected, see, e.g., Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 622 (1984); NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 460-461 (1958). What is at play here is not coercion, but the compulsion of ideas-and the private right to exert and receive that compulsion (or to have one's children receive it) is protected by the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses, see, e.g., Heffron v. International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U.S. 640, 647 (1981); Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105, 108-109 (1943); Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 307-310 (1940), not banned by the Establishment Clause. A priest has as much liberty to proselytize as a patriot.~    ~    ~      47~      As to endorsement, I have previously written that \"[r]eligious expression cannot violate the Establishment Clause where it (1) is purely private and (2) occurs in a traditional or designated public forum, publicly announced and open to all on equal terms.\" Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U.S. 753, 770 (1995). The same is true of private speech that occurs in a limited public forum, publicly announced, whose boundaries are not drawn to favor religious groups but instead permit a cross-section of uses. In that context, which is this case, \"erroneous conclusions [about endorsement] do not count.\" Id., at 765. See also Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. 384, 401 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (\"I would hold, simply and clearly, that giving [a private religious group] nondiscriminatory access to school facilities cannot violate [the Establishment Clause] because it does not signify state or local embrace of a particular religious sect\").~    ~    II~    ~      48~      Second, since we have rejected the only reason that respondent gave for excluding the Club's speech from a forum that clearly included it (the forum was opened to any \"us[e] pertaining to the welfare of the community,\" App. to Pet. for Cert. D1), I do not suppose it matters whether the exclusion is characterized as viewpoint or subject-matter discrimination. Lacking any legitimate reason for excluding the Club's speech from its forum-\"because it's religious\" will not do, see, e.g., Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 532-533, 546 (1993); Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 877-878 (1990)-respondent would seem to fail First Amendment scrutiny regardless of how its action is characterized. Even subject-matter limits must at least be \"reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum,\" Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense  Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 806 (1985).1 But I agree, in any event, that respondent did discriminate on the basis of viewpoint.~    ~    ~      49~      As I understand it, the point of disagreement between the Court and the dissenters (and the Court of Appeals) with regard to petitioner's Free Speech Clause claim is not whether the Good News Club must be permitted to present religious viewpoints on morals and character in respondent's forum, which has been opened to secular discussions of that subject, see ante, at 7-8.2 The answer to that is established by our decision in Lamb's Chapel, supra. The point of disagreement is not even whether some of the Club's religious speech fell within the protection of Lamb's Chapel. It certainly did. See ante, at 8; 202 F.3d 502, 509 (CA2 2000) (the Club's \"teachings may involve secular values such as obedience or resisting jealousy\").~    ~    ~      50~      The disagreement, rather, regards the portions of the Club's meetings that are not \"purely\" \"discussions\" of morality and character from a religious viewpoint. The Club, for example, urges children \"who already believe in the Lord Jesus as their Savior\" to \"[s]top and ask God for the strength and the 'want' ... to obey Him,\" 21 F. Supp.2d 147, 156 (NDNY 1998) (internal quotation marks omitted), and it invites children who \"don't know Jesus as Savior\" to \"trust the Lord Jesus to be [their] Savior from sin,\" ibid. The dissenters and the Second Circuit say that the presence of such additional speech, because it is purely religious, transforms the Club's meetings into something different in kind from other, nonreligious activities that teach moral and character development. See post, at 4-5 (Stevens, J., dissenting); post, at 4-5 (Souter, J., dissenting); 202 F.3d, at 509-511. Therefore, the argument goes, excluding the Club is not viewpoint discrimination. I disagree.~    ~    ~      51~      Respondent has opened its facilities to any \"us[e] pertaining to the welfare of the community, provided that such us[e] shall be nonexclusive and shall be opened to the general public.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. D1. Shaping the moral and character development of children certainly \"pertain[s] to the welfare of the community.\" Thus, respondent has agreed that groups engaged in the endeavor of developing character may use its forum. The Boy Scouts, for example, may seek \"to influence a boy's character, development and spiritual growth,\" App. N10-N11; cf. Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640, 649 (2000) (\"[T]he general mission of the Boy Scouts is clear: '[t]o instill values in young people' \" (quoting the Scouts' mission statement)), and a group may use Aesop's Fables to teach moral values, App. N11. When the Club attempted to teach Biblical-based moral values, however, it was excluded because its activities \"d[id] not involve merely a religious perspective on the secular subject of morality\" and because \"it [was] clear from the conduct of the meetings that the Good News Club goes far beyond merely stating its viewpoint.\" 202 F.3d, at 510.~    ~    ~      52~      From no other group does respondent require the sterility of speech that it demands of petitioners. The Boy Scouts could undoubtedly buttress their exhortations to keep \"morally straight\" and live \"clean\" lives, see Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, supra, at 649, by giving reasons why that is a good idea-because parents want and expect it, because it will make the scouts \"better\" and \"more successful\" people, because it will emulate such admired past Scouts as former President Gerald Ford. The Club, however, may only discuss morals and character, and cannot give its reasons why they should be fostered-because God wants and expects it, because it will make the Club members \"saintly\" people, and because it emulates Jesus Christ. The Club may not, in other words, independently discuss the religious premise on which its views are based-that God exists and His assistance is necessary to morality. It may not defend the premise, and it absolutely must not seek to persuade the children that the premise is true. The children must, so to say, take it on faith. This is blatant viewpoint discrimination. Just as calls to character based on patriotism will go unanswered if the listeners do not believe their country is good and just, calls to moral behavior based on God's will are useless if the listeners do not believe that God exists. Effectiveness in presenting a viewpoint rests on the persuasiveness with which the speaker defends his premise-and in respondent's facilities every premise but a religious one may be defended.~    ~    ~      53~      In Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819 (1995), we struck down a similar viewpoint restriction. There, a private student newspaper sought funding from a student-activity fund on the same basis as its secular counterparts. And though the paper printed such directly religious material as exhortations to belief, see id., at 826 (quoting the paper's self-described mission \" 'to encourage students to consider what a personal relationship with Jesus Christ means' \"); id., at 865 (Souter, J., dissenting) (\" 'The only way to salvation through Him is by confessing and repenting of sin. It is the Christian's duty to make sinners aware of their need for salvation' \" (quoting the paper)); see also id., at 865-867 (quoting other examples), we held that refusing to provide the funds discriminated on the basis of viewpoint, because the religious speech had been used to \"provid[e] ... a specific premise ... from which a variety of subjects may be discussed and considered,\" id., at 831 (opinion of the Court). The right to present a viewpoint based on a religion premise carried with it the right to defend the premise.~    ~    ~      54~      The dissenters emphasize that the religious speech used by the Club as the foundation for its views on morals and character is not just any type of religious speech-although they cannot agree exactly what type of religious speech it is. In Justice Stevens' view, it is speech \"aimed principally at proselytizing or inculcating belief in a particular religious faith,\" post, at 1; see also post, at 5, n. 3. This does not, to begin with, distinguish Rosenberger, which also involved proselytizing speech, as the above quotations show. See also Rosenberger, supra, at 844 (referring approvingly to the dissent's description of the paper as a \"wor[k] characterized by ... evangelism\"). But in addition, it does not distinguish the Club's activities from those of the other groups using respondent's forum-which have not, as Justice Stevens suggests, see post, at 2-3, been restricted to roundtable \"discussions\" of moral issues. Those groups may seek to inculcate children with their beliefs, and they may furthermore \"recruit others to join their respective groups,\" post, at 3. The Club must therefore have liberty to do the same, even if, as Justice Stevens fears without support in the record, see post, at 3, its actions may prove (shudder!) divisive. See Lamb's Chapel, 508 U.S., at 395 (remarking that worries about \"public unrest\" caused by \"proselytizing\" are \"difficult to defend as a reason to deny the presentation of a religious point of view\"); cf. Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 684-685 (1984) (holding that \"political divisiveness\" could not invalidate inclusion of crche in municipal Christmas display); Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S., at 310-311.~    ~    ~      55~      Justice Souter, while agreeing that the Club's religious speech \"may be characterized as proselytizing,\" post, at 5, n. 3, thinks that it is even more clearly excludable from respondent's forum because it is essentially \"an evangelical service of worship,\" post, at 5. But we have previously rejected the attempt to distinguish worship from other religious speech, saying that \"the distinction has [no] intelligible content,\" and further, no \"relevance\" to the constitutional issue. Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 269, n. 6 (1981); see also Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U.S., at 109 (refusing to distinguish evangelism from worship).3 Those holdings are surely proved correct today by the dissenters' inability to agree, even between themselves, into which subcategory of religious speech the Club's activities fell. If the distinction did have content, it would be beyond the courts' competence to administer. Widmar v. Vincent, supra, at 269, n. 6; cf. Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577, 616-617 (1992) (Souter, J., concurring) (\"I can hardly imagine a subject less amenable to the competence of the federal judiciary, or more deliberately to be avoided where possible,\" than \"comparative theology\"). And if courts (and other government officials) were competent, applying the distinction would require state monitoring of private, religious speech with a degree of pervasiveness that we have previously found unacceptable. See, e.g., Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., supra, at 844-845; Widmar v. Vincent, supra, at 269, n. 6. I will not endorse an approach that suffers such a wondrous diversity of flaws.~    ~    ~      56~      * * *~    ~    ~      57~      With these words of explanation, I join the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         In this regard, I should note the inaccuracy of the Justice Souter's claim that the reasonableness of the forum limitation is not properly before us, see post, at 2-3, and n. 1 (dissenting opinion). Petitioners argued, both in their papers filed in the District Court, Memorandum of Law in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment in No. 97-CV-0302 (NDNY), pp. 20-22, and in their brief filed on appeal, Brief for Appellants in No. 98-9494 (CA2), pp. 33-35, that respondent's exclusion of them from the forum was unreasonable in light of the purposes served by the forum. Although the District Court did say in passing that the reasonableness of respondent's general restriction on use of its facilities for religious purposes was not challenged, see 21 F. Supp.2d 147, 154 (NDNY 1998), the Court of Appeals apparently decided that the particular reasonableness challenge brought by petitioners had been preserved, because it addressed the argument on the merits, see 202 F.3d 502, 509 (CA2 2000) (\"Taking first the reasonableness criterion, the Club argues that the restriction is unreasonable ... . This argument is foreclosed by precedent\").~      ~      ~        2~         Neither does the disagreement center on the mode of the Club's speech-the fact that it sings songs and plays games. Although a forum could perhaps be opened to lectures but not plays, debates but not concerts, respondent has placed no such restrictions on the use of its facilities. See App. N8, N14, N19 (allowing seminars, concerts, and plays).~      ~      ~        3~         We have drawn a different distinction-between religious speech generally and speech about religion-but only with regard to restrictions the State must place on its own speech, where pervasive state monitoring is unproblematic. See School Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 225 (1963) (State schools in their official capacity may not teach religion but may teach about religion). Whatever the rule there, licensing and monitoring private religious speech is an entirely different matter, see, e.g., Kunz v. New York, 340 U.S. 290, 293-294 (1951), even in a limited public forum where the state has some authority to draw subject-matter distinctions.~      ~    ~    ~      58~      Justice Breyer, concurring in part.~    ~    ~      59~      I agree with the Court's conclusion and join its opinion to the extent that they are consistent with the following three observations. First, the government's \"neutrality\" in respect to religion is one, but only one, of the considerations relevant to deciding whether a public school's policy violates the Establishment Clause. See, e.g., Mitchell v. Helms, 530 U.S. 793, 839 (2000) (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U.S. 753, 774, 777 (1995) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). As this Court previously has indicated, a child's perception that the school has endorsed a particular religion or religion in general may also prove critically important. See School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U.S. 373, 389-390 (1985); see also Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. 384, 395 (1993); County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U.S. 573, 592-594 (1989). Today's opinion does not purport to change that legal principle.~    ~    ~      60~      Second, the critical Establishment Clause question here may well prove to be whether a child, participating in the Good News Club's activities, could reasonably perceive the school's permission for the club to use its facilities as an endorsement of religion. See Ball, supra, at 390 (\"[A]n important concern of the effects test is whether ... the challenged government action is sufficiently likely to be perceived by adherents of the controlling denominations as an endorsement, and by the nonadherents as a disapproval, of their individual religious choices\"). The time of day, the age of the children, the nature of the meetings, and other specific circumstances are relevant in helping to determine whether, in fact, the Club \"so dominate[s]\" the \"forum\" that, in the children's minds, \"a formal policy of equal access is transformed into a demonstration of approval.\" Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd., supra, at 777 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).~    ~    ~      61~      Third, the Court cannot fully answer the Establishment Clause question this case raises, given its procedural posture. The specific legal action that brought this case to the Court of Appeals was the District Court's decision to grant Milford Central School's motion for summary judgment. The Court of Appeals affirmed the grant of summary judgment. We now hold that the school was not entitled to summary judgment, either in respect to the Free Speech or the Establishment Clause issue. Our holding must mean that, viewing the disputed facts (including facts about the children's perceptions) favorably to the Club (the non moving party), the s chool has not shown an Establishment Clause violation.~    ~    ~      62~      To deny one party's motion for summary judgment, however, is not to grant summary judgment for the other side. There may be disputed \"genuine issue[s]\" of \"material fact,\" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(c), particularly about how a reasonable child participant would understand the school's role, cf. post, at 7 (Souter, J., dissenting). Indeed, the Court itself points to facts not in evidence, ante, at 17 (\"There is no evidence that young children are permitted to loiter outside classrooms after the schoolday has ended\"), ante, at 18 (\"There may be as many, if not more, upperclassmen than elementary school children who occupy the school after hours\"), identifies facts in evidence which may, depending on other facts not in evidence, be of legal significance, ante, at 17 (discussing the type of room in which the meetings were held and noting that the Club's participants \"are not all the same age as in the normal classroom setting\"), and makes assumptions about other facts, ibid. (\"Surely even young children are aware of events for which their parents must sign permission forms\"), ante, at 18 (\"Any bystander could conceivably be aware of the school's use policy and its exclusion of the Good News Club, and could suffer as much from viewpoint discrimination as elementary school children could suffer from perceived endorsement\"). The Court's invocation of what is missing from the record and its assumptions about what is present in the record only confirm that both parties, if they so desire, should have a fair opportunity to fill the evidentiary gap in light of today's opinion. Cf. Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 56(c) (summary judgment appropriate only where there is \"no genuine issue as to any material fact\" and movant \"is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law\"), 56(f) (permitting supplementation of record for summary judgment purposes where appropriate).~    ~    ~      63~      Justice Stevens, dissenting.~    ~    ~      64~      The Milford Central School has invited the public to use its facilities for educational and recreational purposes, but not for \"religious purposes.\" Speech for \"religious purposes\" may reasonably be understood to encompass three different categories. First, there is religious speech that is simply speech about a particular topic from a religious point of view. The film in Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. 384 (1993), illustrates this category. See id., at 388 (observing that the film series at issue in that case \"would discuss Dr. [James] Dobson's views on the undermining influences of the media that could only be counterbalanced by returning to traditional, Christian family values instilled at an early stage\").  Second, there is religious speech that amounts to worship, or its equivalent. Our decision in Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 (1981), concerned such speech. See id., at 264-265 (describing the speech in question as involving \"religious worship\"). Third, there is an intermediate category that is aimed principally at proselytizing or inculcating belief in a particular religious faith.~    ~    ~      65~      A public entity may not generally exclude even religious worship from an open public forum. Id., at 276. Similarly, a public entity that creates a limited public forum for the discussion of certain specified topics may not exclude a speaker simply because she approaches those topics from a religious point of view. Thus, in Lamb's Chapel we held that a public school that permitted its facilities to be used for the discussion of family issues and child rearing could not deny access to speakers presenting a religious point of view on those issues. See Lamb's Chapel, 508 U.S., at 393-394.~    ~    ~      66~      But, while a public entity may not censor speech about an authorized topic based on the point of view expressed by the speaker, it has broad discretion to \"preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated.\" Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S. 828, 836 (1976); see also Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 275, n. 6 (1990) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\"A school's extracurricular activities constitute a part of the school's teaching mission, and the school accordingly must make 'decisions concerning the content of those activities' \" (quoting Widmar, 454 U.S., at 278 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment)). Accordingly, \"control over access to a nonpublic forum can be based on subject matter and speaker identity so long as the distinctions drawn are reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum and are viewpoint neutral.\" Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense  Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 806 (1985). The novel question that this case presents concerns the constitutionality of a public school's attempt to limit the scope of a public forum it has created. More specifically, the question is whether a school can, consistently with the First Amendment, create a limited public forum that admits the first type of religious speech without allowing the other two.~    ~    ~      67~      Distinguishing speech from a religious viewpoint, on the one hand, from religious proselytizing, on the other, is comparable to distinguishing meetings to discuss political issues from meetings whose principal purpose is to recruit new members to join a political organization. If a school decides to authorize after school discussions of current events in its classrooms, it may not exclude people from expressing their views simply because it dislikes their particular political opinions. But must it therefore allow organized political groups-for example, the Democratic Party, the Libertarian Party, or the Ku Klux Klan-to hold meetings, the principal purpose of which is not to discuss the current-events topic from their own unique point of view but rather to recruit others to join their respective groups? I think not. Such recruiting meetings may introduce divisiveness and tend to separate young children into cliques that undermine the school's educational mission. Cf. Lehman v. Shaker Heights, 418 U.S. 298 (1974) (upholding a city's refusal to allow \"political advertising\" on public transportation).~    ~    ~      68~      School officials may reasonably believe that evangelical meetings designed to convert children to a particular religious faith pose the same risk. And, just as a school may allow meetings to discuss current events from a political perspective without also allowing organized political recruitment, so too can a school allow discussion of topics such as moral development from a religious (or nonreligious) perspective without thereby opening its forum to religious proselytizing or worship. See, e.g., Campbell v. St. Tammany Parish School Board, 231 F.3d 937, 942 (CA5 2000) (\"Under the Supreme Court's jurisprudence, a government entity such as a school board has the opportunity to open its facilities to activity protected by the First Amendment, without inviting political or religious activities presented in a form that would disserve its efforts to maintain neutrality\"). Moreover, any doubt on a question such as this should be resolved in a way that minimizes \"intrusion by the Federal Government into the operation of our public schools,\" Mergens, 496 U.S., at 290 (Stevens, J., dissenting); see also Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97, 104 (1968) (\"Judicial interposition in the operation of the public school system of the Nation raises problems requiring care and restraint... . By and large, public education in our Nation is committed to the control of state and local authorities\").~    ~    ~      69~      The particular limitation of the forum at issue in this case is one that prohibits the use of the school's facilities for \"religious purposes.\" It is clear that, by \"religious purposes,\" the school district did not intend to exclude all speech from a religious point of view. See App. N13-N15 (testimony of the superintendent for Milford schools indicating that the policy would permit people to teach \"that man was created by God as described in the Book of Genesis\" and that crime was caused by society's \"lack of faith in God\"). Instead, it sought only to exclude religious speech whose principal goal is to \"promote the gospel.\" App. N18. In other words, the school sought to allow the first type of religious speech while excluding the second and third types. As long as this is done in an even handed manner, I see no constitutional violation in such an effort.1 The line between the various categories of religious speech may be difficult to draw, but I think that the distinctions are valid, and that a school, particularly an elementary school, must be permitted to draw them.2 Cf. Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Ed. of School Dist. No. 71, Champaign Cty., 333 U.S. 203, 231 (1948) (Frankfurter, J., concurring) (\"In no activity of the State is it more vital to keep out divisive forces than in its schools ...\").~    ~    ~      70~      This case is undoubtedly close. Nonetheless, regardless of whether the Good News Club's activities amount to \"worship,\" it does seem clear, based on the facts in the record, that the school district correctly classified those activities as falling within the third category of religious speech and therefore beyond the scope of the school's limited public forum.3 In short, I am persuaded that the school district could (and did) permissibly exclude from its limited public forum proselytizing religious speech that does not rise to the level of actual worship. I would therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.~    ~    ~      71~      Even if I agreed with Part II of the majority opinion, however, I would not reach out, as it does in Part IV, to decide a constitutional question that was not addressed by either the District Court or the Court of Appeals.~    ~    ~      72~      Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         The school district, for example, could not, consistently with its present policy, allow school facilities to be used by a group that affirmatively attempted to inculcate nonbelief in God or in the view that morality is wholly unrelated to belief in God. Nothing in the record, however, indicates that any such group was allowed to use school facilities.~      ~      ~        2~         \"A perceptive observer sees a material difference between the light of day and the dark of night, and knows that difference to be a reality even though the two are separated not by a bright line but by a zone of twilight.\" Buirkle v. Hanover Insurance Cos., 832 F. Supp. 469, 483 (Mass. 1993).~      ~      ~        3~         The majority elides the distinction between religious speech on a particular topic and religious speech that seeks primarily to inculcate belief. Thus, it relies on Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819 (1995), as if that case involved precisely the same type of speech that is at issue here. But, while both Wide Awake, the organization in Rosenberger, and the Good News Club engage in a mixture of different types of religious speech, the Rosenberger Court clearly believed that the first type of religious speech predominated in Wide Awake. It described that group's publications as follows: \"The first issue had articles about racism, crisis pregnancy, stress, prayer, C.S. Lewis' ideas about evil and free will, and reviews of religious music. In the next two issues, Wide Awake featured stories about homosexuality, Christian missionary work, and eating disorders, as well as music reviews and interviews with University professors.\" Id., at 826. In contrast to Wide Awake's emphasis on providing Christian commentary on such a diverse array of topics, Good News Club meetings are dominated by religious exhortation, see post, at 4-5 (Souter, J., dissenting). My position is therefore consistent with the Court's decision in Rosenberger.~      ~    ~    ~      73~      Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, dissenting.~    ~    ~      74~      The majority rules on two issues. First, it decides that the Court of Appeals failed to apply the rule in Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. 384 (1993), which held that the government may not discriminate on the basis of viewpoint in operating a limited public forum. The majority applies that rule and concludes that Milford violated Lamb's Chapel in denying Good News the use of the school. The majority then goes on to determine that it would not violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment for the Milford School District to allow the Good News Club to hold its intended gatherings of public school children in Milford's elementary school. The majority is mistaken on both points. The Court of Appeals unmistakably distinguished this case from Lamb's Chapel, though not by name, and accordingly affirmed the application of a policy, unchallenged in the District Court, that Milford's public schools may not be used for religious purposes. As for the applicability of the Establishment Clause to the Good News Club's intended use of Milford's school, the majority commits error even in reaching the issue, which was addressed neither by the Court of Appeals nor by the District Court. I respectfully dissent.~    ~    ~      75~      * Lamb's Chapel, a case that arose (as this one does) from application of N. Y. Educ. Law 414 (McKinney 2000) and local policy implementing it, built on the accepted rule that a government body may designate a public forum subject to a reasonable limitation on the scope of permitted subject matter and activity, so long as the government does not use the forum-defining restrictions to deny expression to a particular viewpoint on subjects open to discussion. Specifically, Lamb's Chapel held that the government could not \"permit school property to be used for the presentation of all views about family issues and child rearing except those dealing with the subject matter from a religious standpoint.\" 508 U.S., at 393-394.~    ~    ~      76~      This case, like Lamb's Chapel, properly raises no issue about the reasonableness of Milford's criteria for restricting the scope of its designated public forum. Milford has opened school property for, among other things, \"instruction in any branch of education, learning or the arts\" and for \"social, civic and recreational meetings and entertainment events and other uses pertaining to the welfare of the community, provided that such uses shall be nonexclusive and shall be opened to the general public.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. D1-D3. But Milford has done this subject to the restriction that \"[s]chool premises shall not be used ... for religious purposes.\" Id., at D2. As the District Court stated, Good News did \"not object to the reasonableness of [Milford]'s policy that prohibits the use of [its] facilities for religious purposes.\" Id., at C14.~    ~    ~      77~      The sole question before the District Court was, therefore, whether, in refusing to allow Good News's intended use, Milford was misapplying its unchallenged restriction in a way that amounted to imposing a viewpoint-based restriction on what could be said or done by a group entitled to use the forum for an educational, civic, or other permitted purpose. The question was whether Good News was being disqualified when it merely sought to use the school property the same way that the Milford Boy and Girl Scouts and the 4-H Club did. The District Court held on the basis of undisputed facts that Good News's activity was essentially unlike the presentation of views on secular issues from a religious standpoint held to be protected in Lamb's Chapel, see App. to Pet. for Cert. C29-C31, and was instead activity precluded by Milford's unchallenged policy against religious use, even under the narrowest definition of that term.~    ~    ~      78~      The Court of Appeals understood the issue the same way. See 202 F.3d 502, 508 (CA2 2000) (Good News argues that \"to exclude the Club because it teaches morals and values from a Christian perspective constitutes unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination\"); id., at 509 (\"The crux of the Good News Club's argument is that the Milford school's application of the Community Use Policy to exclude the Club from its facilities is not viewpoint neutral\").1 The Court of Appeals also realized that the Lamb's Chapel criterion was the appropriate measure: \"The activities of the Good News Club do not involve merely a religious perspective on the secular subject of morality.\" 202 F.3d, at 510. Cf. Lamb's Chapel, supra, at 393 (district could not exclude \"religious standpoint\" in discussion on childrearing and family values, an undisputed \"use for social or civic purposes otherwise permitted\" under the use policy).2 The appeals court agreed with the District Court that the undisputed facts in this case differ from those in Lamb's Chapel, as night from day. A sampling of those facts shows why both courts were correct.~    ~    ~      79~      Good News's classes open and close with prayer. In a sample lesson considered by the District Court, children are instructed that \"[t]he Bible tells us how we can have our sins forgiven by receiving the Lord Jesus Christ. It tells us how to live to please Him... . If you have received the Lord Jesus as your Saviour from sin, you belong to God's special group-His family.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. C17-C18 (ellipsis in original). The lesson plan instructs the teacher to \"lead a child to Christ,\" and, when reading a Bible verse, to \"[e]mphasize that this verse is from the Bible, God's Word\" and is \"important-and true-because God said it.\" The lesson further exhorts the teacher to \"[b]e sure to give an opportunity for the 'unsaved' children in your class to respond to the Gospel\" and cautions against \"neglect[ing] this responsibility.\" Id., at C20.~    ~    ~      80~      While Good News's program utilizes songs and games, the heart of the meeting is the \"challenge\" and \"invitation,\" which are repeated at various times throughout the lesson. During the challenge, \"saved\" children who \"already believe in the Lord Jesus as their Savior\" are challenged to \" 'stop and ask God for the strength and the \"want\" . . . to obey Him.' \" Ibid. They are instructed that \"[i]f you know Jesus as your Savior, you need to place God first in your life. And if you don't know Jesus as Savior and if you would like to, then we will-we will pray with you separately, individually... . And the challenge would be, those of you who know Jesus as Savior, you can rely on God's strength to obey Him.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      81~      During the invitation, the teacher \"invites\" the \"unsaved\" children \" 'to trust the Lord Jesus to be your Savior from sin,' \" and \" 'receiv[e] [him] as your Savior from sin.' \" Id., at C21. The children are then instructed that \"[i]f you believe what God's Word says about your sin and how Jesus died and rose again for you, you can have His forever life today. Please bow your heads and close your eyes. If you have never believed on the Lord Jesus as your Savior and would like to do that, please show me by raising your hand. If you raised your hand to show me you want to believe on the Lord Jesus, please meet me so I can show you from God's Word how you can receive His everlasting life.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      82~      It is beyond question that Good News intends to use the public school premises not for the mere discussion of a subject from a particular, Christian point of view, but for an evangelical service of worship calling children to commit themselves in an act of Christian conversion.3 The majority avoids this reality only by resorting to the bland and general characterization of Good News's activity as \"teaching of morals and character, from a religious standpoint.\" See ante, at 9. If the majority's statement ignores reality, as it surely does, then today's holding may be understood only in equally generic terms. Otherwise, indeed, this case would stand for the remarkable proposition that any public school opened for civic meetings must be opened for use as a church, synagogue, or mosque.~    ~    II~    ~      83~      I also respectfully dissent from the majority's refusal to remand on all other issues, insisting instead on acting as a court of first instance in reviewing Milford's claim that it would violate the Establishment Clause to grant Good News's application. Milford raised this claim to demonstrate a compelling interest for saying no to Good News, even on the erroneous assumption that Lamb's Chapel's public forum analysis would otherwise require Milford to say yes. Whereas the District Court and Court of Appeals resolved this case entirely on the ground that Milford's actions did not offend the First Amendment's Speech Clause, the majority now sees fit to rule on the application of the Establishment Clause, in derogation of this Court's proper role as a court of review. E.g., National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Smith, 525 U.S. 459, 470 (1999) (\"[W]e do not decide in the first instance issues not decided below\").~    ~    ~      84~      The Court's usual insistence on resisting temptations to convert itself into a trial court and on remaining a court of review is not any mere procedural nicety, and my objection to turning us into a district court here does not hinge on a preference for immutable procedural rules. Respect for our role as a reviewing court rests, rather, on recognizing that this Court can often learn a good deal from considering how a district court and a court of appeals have worked their way through a difficult issue. It rests on recognizing that an issue as first conceived may come to be seen differently as a case moves through trial and appeal; we are most likely to contribute something of value if we act with the benefit of whatever refinement may come in the course of litigation. And our customary refusal to become a trial court reflects the simple fact that this Court cannot develop a record as well as a trial court can. If I were a trial judge, for example, I would balk at deciding on summary judgment whether an Establishment Clause violation would occur here without having statements of undisputed facts or uncontradicted affidavits showing, for example, whether Good News conducts its instruction at the same time as school-sponsored extracurricular and athletic activities conducted by school staff and volunteers, see Brief for Respondent 6; whether any other community groups use school facilities immediately after classes end and how many students participate in those groups; and the extent to which Good News, with 28 students in its membership, may \"dominate the forum\" in a way that heightens the perception of official endorsement, Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 851 (1995) (O'Connor, J., concurring); see also Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 274 (1981). We will never know these facts.~    ~    ~      85~      Of course, I am in no better position than the majority to perform an Establishment Clause analysis in the first instance. Like the majority, I lack the benefit that development in the District Court and Court of Appeals might provide, and like the majority I cannot say for sure how complete the record may be. I can, however, speak to the doubtful underpinnings of the majority's conclusion.~    ~    ~      86~      This Court has accepted the independent obligation to obey the Establishment Clause as sufficiently compelling to satisfy strict scrutiny under the First Amendment. See id., at 271 (\"[T]he interest of the [government] in complying with its constitutional obligations may be characterized as compelling\"); Lamb's Chapel, 508 U.S., at 394. Milford's actions would offend the Establishment Clause if they carried the message of endorsing religion under the circumstances, as viewed by a reasonable observer. See Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U.S. 753, 777 (1995) (O'Connor, J., concurring). The majority concludes that such an endorsement effect is out of the question in Milford's case, because the context here is \"materially indistinguishable\" from the facts in Lamb's Chapel and Widmar. Ante, at 13. In fact, the majority is in no position to say that, for the principal grounds on which we based our Establishment Clause holdings in those cases are clearly absent here.~    ~    ~      87~      In Widmar, we held that the Establishment Clause did not bar a religious student group from using a public university's meeting space for worship as well as discussion. As for the reasonable observers who might perceive government endorsement of religion, we pointed out that the forum was used by university students, who \"are, of course, young adults,\" and, as such, \"are less impressionable than younger students and should be able to appreciate that the University's policy is one of neutrality toward religion.\" 454 U.S., at 274, n. 14. To the same effect, we remarked that the \"large number of groups meeting on campus\" negated \"any reasonable inference of University support from the mere fact of a campus meeting place.\" Ibid. Not only was the forum \"available to a broad class of nonreligious as well as religious speakers,\" but there were, in fact, over 100 recognized student groups at the University, and an \"absence of empirical evidence that religious groups [would] dominate [the University's] open forum.\" Id., at 274-275; see also id., at 274 (\"The provision of benefits to so broad a spectrum of groups is an important index of secular effect\"). And if all that had not been enough to show that the university-student use would probably create no impression of religious endorsement, we pointed out that the university in that case had issued a student handbook with the explicit disclaimer that \"the University's name will not 'be identified in any way with the aims, policies, programs, products, or opinions of any organization or its members.' \" Id., at 274, n. 14.~    ~    ~      88~      Lamb's Chapel involved an evening film series on child-rearing open to the general public (and, given the subject matter, directed at an adult audience). See 508 U.S., at 387, 395. There, school property \"had repeatedly been used by a wide variety of private organizations,\" and we could say with some assurance that \"[u]nder these circumstances ... there would have been no realistic danger that the community would think that the District was endorsing religion or any particular creed ... .\" Id., at 395.~    ~    ~      89~      What we know about this case looks very little like Widmar or Lamb's Chapel. The cohort addressed by Good News is not university students with relative maturity, or even high school pupils, but elementary school children as young as six.4 The Establishment Clause cases have consistently recognized the particular impressionability of schoolchildren, see Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578, 583-584 (1987), and the special protection required for those in the elementary grades in the school forum, see County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U.S. 573, 620, n. 69 (1989). We have held the difference between college students and grade school pupils to be a \"distinction [that] warrants a difference in constitutional results,\" Edwards v. Aguillard, supra, at 584, n. 5 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).~    ~    ~      90~      Nor is Milford's limited forum anything like the sites for wide-ranging intellectual exchange that were home to the challenged activities in Widmar and Lamb's Chapel. See also Rosenberger, 515 U.S., at 850, 836-837. In Widmar, the nature of the university campus and the sheer number of activities offered precluded the reasonable college observer from seeing government endorsement in any one of them, and so did the time and variety of community use in the Lamb's Chapel case. See also Rosenberger, 515 U.S., at 850 (\"Given this wide array of nonreligious, antireligious and competing religious viewpoints in the forum supported by the University, any perception that the University endorses one particular viewpoint would be illogical\"); id., at 836-837, 850 (emphasizing the array of university-funded magazines containing \"widely divergent viewpoints\" and the fact that believers in Christian evangelism competed on equal footing in the University forum with aficionados of \"Plato, Spinoza, and Descartes,\" as well as \"Karl Marx, Bertrand Russell, and Jean-Paul Sartre\"); Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 252 (1990) (plurality opinion) (\"To the extent that a religious club is merely one of many different student-initiated voluntary clubs, students should perceive no message of government endorsement of religion\").~    ~    ~      91~      The timing and format of Good News's gatherings, on the other hand, may well affirmatively suggest the imprimatur of officialdom in the minds of the young children. The club is open solely to elementary students (not the entire community, as in Lamb's Chapel), only four outside groups have been identified as meeting in the school, and Good News is, seemingly, the only one whose instruction follows immediately on the conclusion of the official school day. See Brief for National School Boards Association et al. as Amici Curiae 6. Although school is out at 2:56 p.m., Good News apparently requested use of the school beginning at 2:30 on Tuesdays \"during the school year,\" so that instruction could begin promptly at 3:00, see Lodging, Exh. W-1, at which time children who are compelled by law to attend school surely remain in the building. Good News's religious meeting follows regular school activities so closely that the Good News instructor must wait to begin until \"the room is clear,\" and \"people are out of the room,\" App. P29, before starting proceedings in the classroom located next to the regular third- and fourth-grade rooms, id., at N12. In fact, the temporal and physical continuity of Good News's meetings with the regular school routine seems to be the whole point of using the school. When meetings were held in a community church, 8 or 10 children attended; after the school became the site, the number went up three-fold. Id., at P12; Lodging, Exh. AA2.~    ~    ~      92~      Even on the summary judgment record, then, a record lacking whatever supplementation the trial process might have led to, and devoid of such insight as the trial and appellate judges might have contributed in addressing the Establishment Clause, we can say this: there is a good case that Good News's exercises blur the line between public classroom instruction and private religious indoctrination, leaving a reasonable elementary school pupil unable to appreciate that the former instruction is the business of the school while the latter evangelism is not. Thus, the facts we know (or think we know) point away from the majority's conclusion, and while the consolation may be that nothing really gets resolved when the judicial process is so truncated, that is not much to recommend today's result.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         The Court of Appeals held that any challenge to the policy's reasonableness was foreclosed by its own precedent, 202 F.3d 502, 509 (CA2 2000), a holding the majority leaves untouched, see ante, at 7 (\"[W]e need not decide whether it is unreasonable in light of the purposes served by the forum\"); cf. ante, at 7, n. 2 (\"Because we hold that the exclusion of the Club on the basis of its religious perspective constitutes unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination, it is no defense for Milford that purely religious purposes can be excluded under state law\"). In any event, the reasonableness of the forum limitation was beyond the scope of the appeal from summary judgment since the District Court had said explicitly that the religious use limitation was not challenged.~      ~      ~        2~         It is true, as the majority notes, ante, at 8, n. 3, that the Court of Appeals did not cite Lamb's Chapel by name. But it followed it in substance, and it did cite an earlier opinion written by the author of the panel opinion here, Bronx Household of Faith v. Community School Dist. No. 10, 127 F.3d 207 (CA2 1997), which discussed Lamb's Chapel at length.~      ~      ~        3~         The majority rejects Milford's contention that Good News's activities fall outside the purview of the limited forum because they constitute \"religious worship\" on the ground that the Court of Appeals made no such determination regarding the character of the club's program, see ante, at 11, n. 4. This distinction is merely semantic, in light of the Court of Appeals's conclusion that \"[i]t is difficult to see how the Club's activities differ materially from the 'religious worship' described\" in other case law, 202 F.3d, at 510, and the record below. Justice Stevens distinguishes between proselytizing and worship, ante, at 1 (dissenting opinion), and distinguishes each from discussion reflecting a religious point of view. I agree with Justice Stevens that Good News's activities may be characterized as proselytizing and therefore as outside the purpose of Milford's limited forum, ante, at 5. Like the Court of Appeals, I also believe Good News's meetings have elements of worship that put the club's activities further afield of Milford's limited forum policy, the legitimacy of which was unchallenged in the summary judgment proceeding.~      ~      ~        4~         It is certainly correct that parents are required to give permission for their children to attend Good News's classes, see ante, at 14, (as parents are often required to do for a host of official school extracurricular activities), and correct that those parents would likely not be confused as to the sponsorship of Good News's classes. But the proper focus of concern in assessing effects includes the elementary school pupils who are invited to meetings, Lodging, Exh. X2, who see peers heading into classrooms for religious instruction as other classes end, and who are addressed by the \"challenge\" and \"invitation.\"~      ~    ~    ~      93~      The fact that there may be no evidence in the record that individual students were confused during the time the Good News Club met on school premises pursuant to the District Court's preliminary injunction is immaterial, cf. Brief for Petitioners 38. As Justice O'Connor explained in Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U.S. 753 (1995), the endorsement test does not focus \"on the actual perception of individual observers, who naturally have differing degrees of knowledge,\" but on \"the perspective of a hypothetical observer.\" Id., at 779-780 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).~    ~    ",

Before the April 24, 1996, effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), respondent's state robbery conviction became final. He filed, inter alia, a federal habeas petition under 2254. The District Court dismissed the petition without prejudice because it was not apparent that respondent had exhausted available state remedies. On May 20, 1997, without having returned to state court, respondent filed another federal habeas petition. The District Court dismissed that petition because respondent had not filed within a reasonable time from AEDPA's effective date. In reversing, the Second Circuit found that respondent's first federal habeas petition was an application for \"other collateral review\" that tolled the limitation period under 2244(d)(2) and made his current petition timely.\r~      Held: A federal habeas petition is not an \"application for State post-conviction or other collateral review\" within the meaning of 2244(d)(2). As a result, 2244(d)(2) did not toll the limitation period during the pendency of respondent's first federal habeas petition. The Court begins with the language of the statute. See, e.g., Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 420, 431. Petitioner's contention that \"State\" applies to the entire phrase \"post-conviction or other collateral review\" is correct. To begin with, Congress placed \"State\" before that phrase without specifically naming any kind of \"Federal\" review. The fact that other AEDPA provisions denominate expressly both \"State\" and \"Federal\" proceedings, see, e.g., 2254(i), supplies strong evidence that Congress would have mentioned \"Federal\" review expressly had Congress intended to include federal review. See Bates v. United States, 522 U.S. 23, 29-30. Respondent's contrary construction would render the word \"State\" insignificant, if not wholly superfluous. This Court's duty to give effect, where possible, to every word of a statute, United States v. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528, 538-539, makes the Court reluctant to treat statutory terms as surplusage. This is especially so when the term occupies so pivotal a place in the statutory scheme as the word \"State\" in the federal habeas statute. But under respondent's rendition, \"State\" has no operative effect on the scope of 2244(d)(2). The clause would have precisely the same content were it to read \"post-conviction or other collateral review.\" Contrary to the Second Circuit's characterization, petitioner's interpretation does not yield the linguistic oddity \"State other collateral review,\" but more naturally yields the understanding \"other State collateral review.\" Further, that court's reasoning that the phrase \"other collateral review\" would be rendered meaningless if it did not refer to federal habeas petitions depends on the incorrect premise that the only state \"collateral\" review is \"post-conviction\" review. \"[O]ther collateral review\" could include, e.g., a state court civil commitment or civil contempt order. Congress also may have used \"post-conviction or other collateral\" in recognition of the diverse terminology that different States employ to represent the different forms of collateral review that are available after a conviction. Examination of the AEDPA provision establishing the limitation period for filing 2254 petitions in state capital cases, 2263(b)(2), shows that Congress used the disjunctive clause \"post-conviction review or other collateral relief\" where the latter term could not possibly include anything federal within its ambit. Petitioner's construction is also far more consistent than respondent's with AEDPA's purpose to further the principles of comity, finality, and federalism. Respondent contends that petitioner's interpretation creates the potential for unfairness to litigants who file timely federal petitions that are dismissed without prejudice after the limitation period has expired. But the Court's sole task here is one of statutory construction. And in light of the facts that respondent never cured the defects that led to the dismissal of his first federal petition during the remaining nine months of the limitation period, and that his 1996 and 1997 petitions contained different claims, this Court has no occasion to address alternative scenarios. Pp. 3-14.\r~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\r~      208 F.3d 357, reversed and remanded.\r~      O'Connor, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, and Thomas, JJ., joined.\r~      Opinion of the Court\r~      Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.\r~    \r~    \r~      1\r~      Title 28 U.S.C.  2244(d)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. V) provides: \"The time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under this subsection.\" This case presents the question whether a federal habeas corpus petition is an \"application for State post-conviction or other collateral review\" within the meaning of this provision.\r~    \r~    \r~      2\r~      * In 1992, several judgments of conviction for robbery were entered against respondent Sherman Walker in the New York state courts. The last of these convictions came in June 1992, when respondent pleaded guilty to robbery in the first degree in the New York Supreme Court, Queens County. Respondent was sentenced to 7 to 14 years in prison on this conviction.\r~    \r~    \r~      3\r~      Respondent unsuccessfully pursued a number of state remedies in connection with his convictions. It is unnecessary to describe all of these proceedings herein. Respondent's last conviction was affirmed on June 12, 1995. Respondent was later denied leave to appeal to the New York Court of Appeals. Respondent also sought a writ of error coram nobis, which the Appellate Division denied on March 18, 1996. Respondent's last conviction became final in April 1996, prior to the April 24, 1996, effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214.\r~    \r~    \r~      4\r~      In a single document dated April 10, 1996, respondent filed a complaint under Rev. Stat. 1979, 42 U.S.C.  1983 and a petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C.  2254 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. On July 9, 1996, the District Court dismissed the complaint and petition without prejudice. With respect to the habeas petition, the District Court, citing 2254(b), concluded that respondent had not adequately set forth his claim because it was not apparent that respondent had exhausted available state remedies. The District Court noted that, for example, respondent had failed to specify the claims litigated in the state appellate proceedings relating to his robbery convictions.\r~    \r~    \r~      5\r~      On May 20, 1997, more than one year after AEDPA's effective date, respondent filed another federal habeas petition in the same District Court. It is undisputed that respondent had not returned to state court since the dismissal of his first federal habeas filing. On May 6, 1998, the District Court dismissed the petition as time barred because respondent had not filed the petition within a \"reasonable time\" from AEDPA's effective date.\r~    \r~    \r~      6\r~      The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the District Court's judgment, reinstated the habeas petition, and remanded the case for further proceedings. Walker v. Artuz, 208 F.3d 357 (2000). The Court of Appeals noted at the outset that, because respondent's conviction had become final prior to AEDPA's effective date, he had until April 24, 1997, to file his federal habeas petition. The court also observed that the exclusion from the limitation period of the time during which respondent's first federal habeas petition was pending in the District Court would render the instant habeas petition timely.\r~    \r~    \r~      7\r~      The Court of Appeals held that respondent's first federal habeas petition had tolled the limitation period because it was an application for \"other collateral review\" within the meaning of 2244(d)(2). The court characterized the disjunctive \"or\" between \"post-conviction\" and \"other collateral\" as creating a \"distinct break\" between two kinds of review. Id., at 359. The court also stated that application of the word \"State\" to both \"post-conviction\" and \"other collateral\" would create a \"linguistic oddity\" in the form of the construction \"State other collateral review.\" Id., at 360. The court further reasoned that the phrase \"other collateral review\" would be meaningless if it did not refer to federal habeas petitions. The court therefore concluded that the word \"State\" modified only \"post-conviction.\"\r~    \r~    \r~      8\r~      The Court of Appeals also found no conflict between its interpretation of the statute and the purpose of AEDPA. The court found instead that its construction would promote the goal of encouraging petitioners to file their federal habeas applications as soon as possible.\r~    \r~    \r~      9\r~      We granted certiorari, 531 U.S. 991 (2000), to resolve a conflict between the Second Circuit's decision and the decisions of three other Courts of Appeals. See Jiminez v. Rice, 222 F.3d 1210 (CA9 2000); Grooms v. Johnson, 208 F.3d 488 (CA5 1999) (per curiam); Jones v. Morton, 195 F.3d 153 (CA3 1999). One other Court of Appeals has since adopted the Second Circuit's view. Petrick v. Martin, 236 F.3d 624 (CA10 2001). We now reverse.\r~    \r~    II\r~    \r~      10\r~      Our task is to construe what Congress has enacted. We begin, as always, with the language of the statute. See, e.g., Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 420, 431 (2000); Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio v. Betts, 492 U.S. 158, 175 (1989); Watt v. Energy Action Ed. Foundation, 454 U.S. 151, 162 (1981). Respondent reads 2244(d)(2) to apply the word \"State\" only to the term \"post-conviction\" and not to the phrase \"other collateral.\" Under this view, a properly filed federal habeas petition tolls the limitation period. Petitioner contends that the word \"State\" applies to the entire phrase \"post-conviction or other collateral review.\" Under this view, a properly filed federal habeas petition does not toll the limitation period.\r~    \r~    \r~      11\r~      We believe that petitioner's interpretation of 2244(d)(2) is correct for several reasons. To begin with, Congress placed the word \"State\" before \"post-conviction or other collateral review\" without specifically naming any kind of \"Federal\" review. The essence of respondent's position is that Congress used the phrase \"other collateral review\" to incorporate federal habeas petitions into the class of applications for review that toll the limitation period. But a comparison of the text of 2244(d)(2) with the language of other AEDPA provisions supplies strong evidence that, had Congress intended to include federal habeas petitions within the scope of 2244(d)(2), Congress would have mentioned \"Federal\" review expressly. In several other portions of AEDPA, Congress specifically used both the words \"State\" and \"Federal\" to denote state and federal proceedings. For example, 28 U.S.C.  2254(i) (1994 ed., Supp. V) provides: \"The ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel during Federal or State collateral post-conviction proceedings shall not be a ground for relief in a proceeding arising under section 2254.\" Likewise, the first sentence of 28 U.S.C.  2261(e) (1994 ed., Supp. V) provides: \"The ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel during State or Federal post-conviction proceedings in a capital case shall not be a ground for relief in a proceeding arising under section 2254.\" The second sentence of 2261(e) states: \"This limitation shall not preclude the appointment of different counsel, on the court's own motion or at the request of the prisoner, at any phase of State or Federal post-conviction proceedings on the basis of the ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel in such proceedings.\" Finally, 28 U.S.C.  2264(a)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. V) excuses a state capital prisoner's failure to raise a claim properly in state court where the failure is \"based on a factual predicate that could not have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence in time to present the claim for State or Federal post-conviction review.\"\r~    \r~    \r~      12\r~      Section 2244(d)(2), by contrast, employs the word \"State,\" but not the word \"Federal,\" as a modifier for \"review.\" It is well settled that \" '[w]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.' \" Bates v. United States, 522 U.S. 23, 29-30 (1997) (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983)). We find no likely explanation for Congress' omission of the word \"Federal\" in 2244(d)(2) other than that Congress did not intend properly filed applications for federal review to toll the limitation period. It would be anomalous, to say the least, for Congress to usher in federal review under the generic rubric of \"other collateral review\" in a statutory provision that refers expressly to \"State\" review, while denominating expressly both \"State\" and \"Federal\" proceedings in other parts of the same statute. The anomaly is underscored by the fact that the words \"State\" and \"Federal\" are likely to be of no small import when Congress drafts a statute that governs federal collateral review of state court judgments.\r~    \r~    \r~      13\r~      Further, were we to adopt respondent's construction of the statute, we would render the word \"State\" insignificant, if not wholly superfluous. \"It is our duty 'to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.' \" United States v. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528, 538-539 (1955) (quoting Montclair v. Ramsdell, 107 U.S. 147, 152 (1883)); see also Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 404 (2000) (describing this rule as a \"cardinal principle of statutory construction\"); Market Co. v. Hoffman, 101 U.S. 112, 115 (1879) (\"As early as in Bacon's Abridgment, sect. 2, it was said that 'a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant' \"). We are thus \"reluctan[t] to treat statutory terms as surplusage\" in any setting. Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore., 515 U.S. 687, 698 (1995); see also Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U.S. 135, 140 (1994). We are especially unwilling to do so when the term occupies so pivotal a place in the statutory scheme as does the word \"State\" in the federal habeas statute. But under respondent's rendition of 2244(d)(2), Congress' inclusion of the word \"State\" has no operative effect on the scope of the provision. If the phrase \"State post-conviction or other collateral review\" is construed to encompass both state and federal collateral review, then the word \"State\" places no constraint on the class of applications for review that toll the limitation period. The clause instead would have precisely the same content were it to read \"post-conviction or other collateral review.\"\r~    \r~    \r~      14\r~      The most that could then be made of the word \"State\" would be to say that Congress singled out applications for \"State post-conviction\" review as one example from the universe of applications for collateral review. Under this approach, however, the word \"State\" still does nothing to delimit the entire class of applications for review that toll the limitation period. A construction under which the word \"State\" does nothing more than further modify \"post-conviction\" relegates \"State\" to quite an insignificant role in the statutory provision. We believe that our duty to \"give each word some operative effect\" where possible, Walters v. Metropolitan Ed. Enterprises, Inc., 519 U.S. 202, 209 (1997), requires more in this context.\r~    \r~    \r~      15\r~      The Court of Appeals characterized petitioner's interpretation as producing the \"linguistic oddity\" of \"State other collateral review,\" which is \"an ungainly construction that [the Court of Appeals did] not believe Congress intended.\" 208 F.3d, at 360. But nothing precludes the application of the word \"State\" to the entire phrase \"post-conviction or other collateral review,\" regardless of the resulting construction that one posits. The term \"other collateral\" is easily understood as a unit to which \"State\" applies just as \"State\" applies to \"post-conviction.\" Moreover, petitioner's interpretation does not compel the verbal formula hypothesized by the Court of Appeals. Indeed, the ungainliness of \"State other collateral review\" is a very good reason why Congress might have avoided that precise verbal formulation in the first place. The application of the word \"State\" to the phrase \"other collateral review\" more naturally yields the understanding \"other State collateral review.\"\r~    \r~    \r~      16\r~      The Court of Appeals also reasoned that petitioner's reading of the statute fails to give operative effect to the phrase \"other collateral review.\" The court claimed that \"the phrase 'other collateral review' would be meaningless if it did not refer to federal habeas petitions.\" Ibid. This argument, however, fails because it depends on the incorrect premise that there can be no form of state \"collateral\" review \"other\" than state \"post-conviction\" review within the meaning of 2244(d)(2). To the contrary, it is possible for \"other collateral review\" to include review of a state court judgment that is not a criminal conviction.\r~    \r~    \r~      17\r~      Section 2244(d)(1)'s 1-year limitation period applies to \"an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.\" Section 2244(d)(2) provides for tolling during the pendency of \"a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim.\" Nothing in the language of these provisions requires that the state court judgment pursuant to which a person is in custody be a criminal conviction. Nor does 28 U.S.C.  2254 (1994 ed. and Supp. V) by its terms apply only to those in custody pursuant to a state criminal conviction. See, e.g., 2254(a) (\"a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court\"); 2254(b)(1) (\"a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court\"); 2254(d) (\"a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court\"); 2254(e)(1) (\"a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court\").\r~    \r~    \r~      18\r~      Incarceration pursuant to a state criminal conviction may be by far the most common and most familiar basis for satisfaction of the \"in custody\" requirement in 2254 cases. But there are other types of state court judgments pursuant to which a person may be held in custody within the meaning of the federal habeas statute. For example, federal habeas corpus review may be available to challenge the legality of a state court order of civil commitment or a state court order of civil contempt. See, e.g., Francois v. Henderson, 850 F.2d 231 (CA5 1988) (entertaining a challenge brought in a federal habeas petition under 2254 to a state court's commitment of a person to a mental institution upon a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity); Leonard v. Hammond, 804 F.2d 838 (CA4 1986) (holding that constitutional challenges to civil contempt orders for failure to pay child support were cognizable only in a habeas corpus action). These types of state court judgments neither constitute nor require criminal convictions. Any state collateral review that is available with respect to these judgments, strictly speaking, is not post-conviction review. Accordingly, even if \" ' \"State post-conviction review\" means all collateral review of a conviction provided by a state,' \" 208 F.3d, at 360 (quoting Barrett v. Yearwood, 63 F. Supp. 2d 1245, 1250 (ED Cal. 1999)), the phrase \"other collateral review\" need not include federal habeas petitions in order to have independent meaning.\r~    \r~    \r~      19\r~      Congress also may have employed the construction \"post-conviction or other collateral\" in recognition of the diverse terminology that different States employ to represent the different forms of collateral review that are available after a conviction. In some jurisdictions, the term \"post-conviction\" may denote a particular procedure for review of a conviction that is distinct from other forms of what conventionally is considered to be postconviction review. For example, Florida employs a procedure that is officially entitled a \"Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence.\" Fla. Rule Crim. Proc. 3.850 (2001). The Florida courts have commonly referred to a Rule 3.850 motion as a \"motion for post-conviction relief\" and have distinguished this procedure from other vehicles for collateral review of a criminal conviction, such as a state petition for habeas corpus. See, e.g., Bryant v. State, 780 So. 2d 978, 979 (Fla. App. 2001) (\"[A] petition for habeas corpus cannot be used to circumvent the two-year period for filing motions for post-conviction relief\"); Finley v. State, 394 So. 2d 215, 216 (Fla. App. 1981) (\"[T]he remedy of habeas corpus is not available as a substitute for post-conviction relief under Rule 3.850\"). Congress may have refrained from exclusive reliance on the term \"post-conviction\" so as to leave no doubt that the tolling provision applies to all types of state collateral review available after a conviction and not just to those denominated \"post-conviction\" in the parlance of a particular jurisdiction.\r~    \r~    \r~      20\r~      Examination of another AEDPA provision also demonstrates that \"other collateral\" need not refer to any form of federal review in order to have meaning. Title 28 U.S.C.  2263 (1994 ed., Supp. V) establishes the limitation period for filing 2254 petitions in state capital cases that arise from jurisdictions meeting the \"opt-in\" requirements of 2261. Section 2263(b)(2) provides that the limitation period \"shall be tolled from the date on which the first petition for post-conviction review or other collateral relief is filed until the final State court disposition of such petition.\" The reference to \"the final State court disposition of such petition\" makes it clear that only petitions filed in state court, and not petitions for federal review, toll the limitation period in capital cases. Congress therefore used the phrases \"post-conviction review\" and \"other collateral relief\" in a disjunctive clause where the term \"other collateral,\" whatever its precise content, could not possibly include anything federal within its ambit. This illustration vitiates any suggestion that \"other collateral\" relief or review must include federal relief or review in order for the term to have any significance apart from \"post-conviction\" review.\r~    \r~    \r~      21\r~      Consideration of the competing constructions in light of AEDPA's purposes reinforces the conclusion that we draw from the text. Petitioner's interpretation of the statute is consistent with \"AEDPA's purpose to further the principles of comity, finality, and federalism.\" Williams, 529 U.S., at 436. Specifically, under petitioner's construction, 2244(d)(2) promotes the exhaustion of state remedies while respecting the interest in the finality of state court judgments. Under respondent's interpretation, however, the provision would do far less to encourage exhaustion prior to seeking federal habeas review and would hold greater potential to hinder finality.\r~    \r~    \r~      22\r~      The exhaustion requirement of 2254(b) ensures that the state courts have the opportunity fully to consider federal-law challenges to a state custodial judgment before the lower federal courts may entertain a collateral attack upon that judgment. See, e.g., O'Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 845 (1999) (\"[T]he exhaustion doctrine is designed to give the state courts a full and fair opportunity to resolve federal constitutional claims before those claims are presented to the federal courts\"); Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 518-519 (1982) (\"A rigorously enforced total exhaustion rule will encourage state prisoners to seek full relief first from the state courts, thus giving those courts the first opportunity to review all claims of constitutional error\"). This requirement \"is principally designed to protect the state courts' role in the enforcement of federal law and prevent disruption of state judicial proceedings.\" Id., at 518. The exhaustion rule promotes comity in that \" 'it would be unseemly in our dual system of government for a federal district court to upset a state court conviction without an opportunity to the state courts to correct a constitutional violation.' \" Ibid. (quoting Darr v. Burford, 339 U.S. 200, 204 (1950)); see also O'Sullivan, supra, at 844 (\"Comity thus dictates that when a prisoner alleges that his continued confinement for a state court conviction violates federal law, the state courts should have the first opportunity to review this claim and provide any necessary relief \").\r~    \r~    \r~      23\r~      The 1-year limitation period of 2244(d)(1) quite plainly serves the well-recognized interest in the finality of state court judgments. See generally Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S. 538, 555-556 (1998). This provision reduces the potential for delay on the road to finality by restricting the time that a prospective federal habeas petitioner has in which to seek federal habeas review.\r~    \r~    \r~      24\r~      The tolling provision of 2244(d)(2) balances the interests served by the exhaustion requirement and the limitation period. Section 2244(d)(2) promotes the exhaustion of state remedies by protecting a state prisoner's ability later to apply for federal habeas relief while state remedies are being pursued. At the same time, the provision limits the harm to the interest in finality by according tolling effect only to \"properly filed application[s] for State post-conviction or other collateral review.\"\r~    \r~    \r~      25\r~      By tolling the limitation period for the pursuit of state remedies and not during the pendency of applications for federal review, 2244(d)(2) provides a powerful incentive for litigants to exhaust all available state remedies before proceeding in the lower federal courts. But if the statute were construed so as to give applications for federal review the same tolling effect as applications for state collateral review, then 2244(d)(2) would furnish little incentive for individuals to seek relief from the state courts before filing federal habeas petitions. The tolling provision instead would be indifferent between state and federal filings. While other statutory provisions, such as 2254(b) itself, of course, would still provide individuals with good reason to exhaust, 2244(d)(2) would be out of step with this design. At the same time, respondent's interpretation would further undermine the interest in finality by creating more potential for delay in the adjudication of federal-law claims.\r~    \r~    \r~      26\r~      A diminution of statutory incentives to proceed first in state court would also increase the risk of the very piecemeal litigation that the exhaustion requirement is designed to reduce. Cf. Rose, 455 U.S., at 520. We have observed that \"strict enforcement of the exhaustion requirement will encourage habeas petitioners to exhaust all of their claims in state court and to present the federal court with a single habeas petition.\" Ibid. But were we to adopt respondent's construction of 2244(d)(2), we would dilute the efficacy of the exhaustion requirement in achieving this objective. Tolling the limitation period for a federal habeas petition that is dismissed without prejudice would thus create more opportunities for delay and piecemeal litigation without advancing the goals of comity and federalism that the exhaustion requirement serves. We do not believe that Congress designed the statute in this manner.\r~    \r~    \r~      27\r~      The Court of Appeals reasoned that its interpretation of the statute would further Congress' goal \"to spur defendants to file their federal habeas petitions more quickly.\" 208 F.3d, at 361. But this view fails to account sufficiently for AEPDA's clear purpose to encourage litigants to pursue claims in state court prior to seeking federal collateral review. See, e.g., 2254(b), 2254(e)(2), 2264(a). Section 2244(d)(1)'s limitation period and 2244(d)(2)'s tolling provision, together with 2254(b)'s exhaustion requirement, encourage litigants first to exhaust all state remedies and then to file their federal habeas petitions as soon as possible.\r~    \r~    \r~      28\r~      Respondent contends that petitioner's construction of the statute creates the potential for unfairness to litigants who file timely federal habeas petitions that are dismissed without prejudice after the limitation period has expired. But our sole task in this case is one of statutory construction, and upon examining the language and purpose of the statute, we are convinced that 2244(d)(2) does not toll the limitation period during the pendency of a federal habeas petition.\r~    \r~    \r~      29\r~      We also note that, when the District Court dismissed respondent's first federal habeas petition without prejudice, respondent had more than nine months remaining in the limitation period in which to cure the defects that led to the dismissal. It is undisputed, however, that petitioner neither returned to state court nor filed a nondefective federal habeas petition before this time had elapsed. Respondent's May 1997 federal habeas petition also contained claims different from those presented in his April 1996 petition. In light of these facts, we have no occasion to address the alternative scenarios that respondent describes. We also have no occasion to address the question that Justice Stevens raises concerning the availability of equitable tolling.\r~    \r~    \r~      30\r~      We hold that an application for federal habeas corpus review is not an \"application for State post-conviction or other collateral review\" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.  2244(d)(2). Section 2244(d)(2) therefore did not toll the limitation period during the pendency of respondent's first federal habeas petition. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.\r~    \r~    \r~      31\r~      Souter, J., filed a concurring opinion.\r~    \r~    \r~      32\r~      Stevens, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, in which Souter, J., joined.\r~    \r~    \r~      33\r~      Breyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Ginsburg, J., joined.\r~    \r~    \r~      34\r~      Justice Souter, concurring.\r~    \r~    \r~      35\r~      Although I join the Court's opinion in full, I have joined Justice Stevens's separate opinion pointing out that nothing bars a district court from retaining jurisdiction pending complete exhaustion of state remedies, and that a claim for equitable tolling could present a serious issue on facts different from those before us.\r~    \r~    \r~      36\r~      Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.\r~    \r~    \r~      37\r~      For substantially the reasons stated at pages 4-10 of the Court's opinion, I agree that the better reading of 28 U.S.C.  2244(d)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. V) is that it encompasses only \"State\" applications for \"post-conviction or other collateral review.\" Thus, as the Court holds, \"an application for federal habeas corpus review is not an 'application for State post-conviction or other collateral review' within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.  2244(d)(2).\" Ante, at 13. I write separately to add two observations regarding the equitable powers of the federal courts, which are unaffected by today's decision construing a single provision of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214.\r~    \r~    \r~      38\r~      First, although the Court's pre-AEDPA decision in Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 522 (1982), prescribed the dismissal of federal habeas corpus petitions containing unexhausted claims, in our post-AEDPA world there is no reason why a district court should not retain jurisdiction over a meritorious claim and stay further proceedings pending the complete exhaustion of state remedies. Indeed, there is every reason to do so when AEDPA gives a district court the alternative of simply denying a petition containing unexhausted but nonmeritorious claims, see 28 U.S.C.  2254(b)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. V), and when the failure to retain jurisdiction would foreclose federal review of a meritorious claim because of the lapse of AEDPA's 1-year limitations period.\r~    \r~    \r~      39\r~      Second, despite the Court's suggestion that tolling the limitations period for a first federal habeas petition would undermine the \"purposes\" of AEDPA, see ante, at 10-14, neither the Court's narrow holding, nor anything in the text or legislative history of AEDPA, precludes a federal court from deeming the limitations period tolled for such a petition as a matter of equity. The Court's opinion does not address a federal court's ability to toll the limitations period apart from 2244(d)(2). See ante, at 13. Furthermore, a federal court might very well conclude that tolling is appropriate based on the reasonable belief that Congress could not have intended to bar federal habeas review for petitioners who invoke the court's jurisdiction within the 1-year interval prescribed by AEDPA.\r~    \r~    \r~      40\r~      After all, federal habeas corpus has evolved as the product of both judicial doctrine and statutory law. See generally E. Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction 15 (3d ed. 1999). In the context of AEDPA's 1-year limitations period, which by its terms runs from \"the date on which the judgment became final,\" see 2244(d)(1)(A), the Courts of Appeals have uniformly created a 1-year grace period, running from the date of AEDPA's enactment, for prisoners whose state convictions became final prior to AEDPA.1 Similarly, federal courts may well conclude that Congress simply overlooked the class of petitioners whose timely filed habeas petitions remain pending in district court past the limitations period, only to be dismissed after the court belatedly realizes that one or more claims have not been exhausted.2 See post, at 2 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (district courts on average take 268 days to dismiss petitions on procedural grounds; 10% remain pending more than 2 years). As a result, equitable considerations may make it appropriate for federal courts to fill in a perceived omission on the part of Congress by tolling AEDPA's statute of limitations for unexhausted federal habeas petitions. Today's ruling does not preclude that possibility, given the limited issue presented in this case and the Court's correspondingly limited holding.3\r~    \r~    \r~      41\r~      I concur in the Court's holding on the understanding that it does not foreclose either of the above safeguards against the potential for injustice that a literal reading of 2244(d)(2) might otherwise produce.\r~    \r~    \r~      \r~        NOTES:\r~      \r~      \r~        1\r~         See, e.g., Gaskins v. Duval, 183 F.3d 8, 9 (CA1 1999); Ross v. Artuz, 150 F.3d 97, 100-103 (CA2 1998); Burns v. Morton, 134 F.3d 109, 111-112 (CA3 1998); Brown v.

District Court, 128 F.3d 1283, 1286-1287 (CA9 1997), overruled on other grounds, 163 F.3d 530, 539-540 (CA9 1998); Hoggro v. Boone, 150 F.3d 1223, 1225-1226 (CA10 1998); Wilcox v. Florida Dept. of Corrections, 158 F.3d 1209, 1211 (CA11 1998).\r~      \r~      \r~        2\r~         The question whether a claim has been exhausted can often be a difficult one, not just for prisoners unschooled in the immense complexities of federal habeas corpus law, see post, at 7 (Breyer, J., dissenting), but also for district courts, see, e.g., Morgan v. Bennett, 204 F.3d 360, 369-371 (CA2 2000) (disagreeing with District Court's conclusion that claim had not been exhausted); Bear v. Boone, 173 F.3d 782, 784-785 (CA10 1999) (same).\r~      \r~      \r~        3\r~         Thus the court below, which resolved the case based on its reading of 28 U.S.C.  2244(d)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. V), and which therefore did not reach the question whether it \"should exercise its equitable powers to exclude the [time] during which the first [habeas] petition was pending,\" 208 F.3d 357, 362 (CA2 2000), is free to consider the issue on remand.\r~      \r~    \r~    \r~      42\r~      Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, dissenting.\r~    \r~    \r~      43\r~      The federal habeas corpus statute limits the period of time during which a state prisoner may file a federal habeas petition to one year, ordinarily running from the time the prisoner's conviction becomes final in the state courts. See 28 U.S.C.  2244(d) (1994 ed., Supp. V). Section 2244(d)(2) tolls that 1-year period while \"a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review . . . is pending.\" The question before us is whether this tolling provision applies to federal, as well as state, collateral review proceedings. Do the words \"other collateral review\" encompass federal habeas corpus proceedings? I believe that they do.\r~    \r~    \r~      44\r~      To understand my conclusion, one must understand why the legal issue before us is significant. Why would a state prisoner ever want federal habeas corpus proceedings to toll the federal habeas corpus limitations period? After all, the very point of tolling is to provide a state prisoner adequate time to file a federal habeas petition. If the petitioner has already filed that petition, what need is there for further tolling?\r~    \r~    \r~      45\r~      The answer to this question-and the problem that gives rise to the issue before us-is that a federal court may be required to dismiss a state prisoner's federal habeas petition, not on the merits, but because that prisoner has not exhausted his state collateral remedies for every claim presented in the federal petition. See 28 U.S.C.  2254(b)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. V) (requiring petitioners to exhaust state remedies before filing federal habeas petition); cf. Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 510 (1982) (holding, under predecessor to current 2254, that district courts cannot reach the merits of \"mixed\" petitions containing both exhausted and unexhausted claims). Such a dismissal means that a prisoner wishing to pursue the claim must return to state court, pursue his state remedies, and then, if he loses, again file a federal habeas petition in federal court. All this takes time. The statute tolls the 1-year limitations period during the time the prisoner proceeds in the state courts. But unless the statute also tolls the limitations period during the time the defective petition was pending in federal court, the state prisoner may find, when he seeks to return to federal court, that he has run out of time.\r~    \r~    \r~      46\r~      This possibility is not purely theoretical. A Justice Department study indicates that 63% of all habeas petitions are dismissed, and 57% of those are dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies. See U.S. Dept. of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Federal Habeas Corpus Review: Challenging State Court Criminal Convictions 17 (1995) (hereinafter Federal Habeas Corpus Review). And it can take courts a significant amount of time to dispose of even those petitions that are not addressed on the merits; on the average, district courts took 268 days to dismiss petitions on procedural grounds. Id., at 23-24; see also id., at 19 (of all habeas petitions, nearly half were pending in the district court for six months or longer; 10% were pending more than two years). Thus, if the words \"other collateral review\" do not include federal collateral review, a large group of federal habeas petitioners, seeking to return to federal court after subsequent state-court rejection of an unexhausted claim, may find their claims time barred. Moreover, because district courts vary substantially in the time they take to rule on habeas petitions, two identically situated prisoners can receive opposite results. If Prisoner A and Prisoner B file mixed petitions in different district courts six months before the federal limitations period expires, and the court takes three months to dismiss Prisoner A's petition, but seven months to dismiss Prisoner B's petition, Prisoner A will be able to return to federal court after exhausting state remedies, but Prisoner B-due to no fault of his own-may not.\r~    \r~    \r~      47\r~      On the other hand, if the words \"other collateral review\" include federal collateral review, state prisoners whose federal claims have been dismissed for nonexhaustion will simply add to the 1-year limitations period the time they previously spent in both state and federal proceedings. Other things being equal, they will be able to return to federal court after pursuing the state remedies that remain available. And similarly situated prisoners will not suffer different outcomes simply because they file their petitions in different district courts.\r~    \r~    \r~      48\r~      The statute's language, read by itself, does not tell us whether the words \"State post-conviction or other collateral review\" include federal habeas proceedings. Rather, it is simply unclear whether Congress intended the word \"State\" to modify \"post-conviction\" review alone, or also to modify \"other collateral review\" (as the majority believes). Indeed, most naturally read, the statute refers to two distinct kinds of applications: (1) applications for \"State post-conviction\" review and (2) applications for \"other collateral review,\" a broad category that, on its face, would include applications for federal habeas review. The majority's reading requires either an unusual intonation-\"State post-conviction-or-other-collateral review\"-or a slight rewrite of the language, by inserting the word \"State\" where it does not appear, between \"other\" and \"collateral.\" Regardless, I believe that either reading is possible. The statute's words, by themselves, have no singular \"plain meaning.\"\r~    \r~    \r~      49\r~      Neither do I believe that the various interpretive canons to which the majority appeals can solve the problem. Invoking the principle that \" 'Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion' \" of particular words, Bates v. United States, 522 U.S. 23, 29-30 (1997) (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983)), the majority attempts to ascertain Congress's intent by looking to the tolling provision's statutory neighbors. It points to other provisions where Congress explicitly used the words \"State\" and \"Federal\" together, expressing its intent to cover both kinds of proceedings. See ante, at 4-5 (citing 28 U.S.C.  2254(i) (1994 ed., Supp. V); 2261(e); 2264(a)(3)). And it reasons that Congress's failure to do so here displays a different intent.\r~    \r~    \r~      50\r~      But other statutory neighbors show that, when Congress wished unambiguously to limit tolling to state proceedings, \"it knew how to do so.\" Custis v. United States, 511 U.S. 485, 492 (1994). In the special tolling provision governing certain capital cases, Congress said explicitly that the limitations period is tolled \"from the date on which the first petition for post-conviction review or other collateral relief is filed until the final State court disposition of such petition,\" thus making it clear that federal proceedings, for example, petitions for certiorari, do not count. 28 U.S.C.  2263(b)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. V) (emphasis added). Does Congress's failure to include a similar qualification in 2244's tolling provision show that it means that provision to cover both federal and state proceedings? In fact, the \"argument from neighbors\" shows only that Congress might have spoken more clearly than it did. It cannot prove the statutory point.\r~    \r~    \r~      51\r~      The majority also believes that only its interpretation gives effect to every word in the statute-in particular the word \"State.\" It asks: If Congress meant to cover federal habeas review, why does the word \"State\" appear in the statute? Federal habeas proceedings are a form of post-conviction proceedings. So, had Congress meant to cover them, it would have just said \"post-conviction and other collateral review.\" See ante, at 6.\r~    \r~    \r~      52\r~      But this argument proves too much, for one can ask with equal force: If Congress intended to exclude federal habeas proceedings, why does the word \"post-conviction\" appear in the statute? State post-conviction proceedings are a form of collateral review. So, had Congress meant to exclude federal collateral proceedings, it could have just said \"State collateral review,\" thereby clearly indicating that the phrase applies only to state proceedings.\r~    \r~    \r~      53\r~      In fact, this kind of argument, viewed realistically, gets us nowhere. Congress probably picked out \"State post-conviction\" proceedings from the universe of collateral proceedings and mentioned it separately because State post-conviction proceedings are a salient example of collateral proceedings. But to understand this is not to understand whether the universe from which Congress picked \"State post-conviction\" proceedings as an example is the universe of all collateral proceedings, or the universe of state collateral proceedings. The statute simply does not say.\r~    \r~    \r~      54\r~      Indeed, the majority recognizes that neither the statute's language, nor the application of canons of construction, is sufficient to resolve the problem. It concedes that the phrase \"other collateral review,\" if construed as \"other [State] collateral review,\" would add little to the coverage that the words \"State post-conviction . . . review\" would provide in its absence. See ante, at 8 (noting that a state criminal conviction is \"by far the most common\" basis for seeking federal habeas review). The majority resolves this difficulty by noting that \"other collateral review\" could also include either review of state civil confinement proceedings or state post-conviction review to which a State refers by some other name, such as state \"habeas\" proceedings. See ante, at 8-9.\r~    \r~    \r~      55\r~      But it is difficult to believe that Congress had state civil proceedings in mind, given that other provisions within 2244 indicate that Congress saw criminal proceedings as its basic subject matter. For instance, the exceptions to the bar against successive petitions in 2244(d) seem to presume that the petition at issue challenges a criminal conviction. See 28 U.S.C.  2244(b)(2)(A) (1994 ed., Supp. V) (requiring a \"new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court\"); 2244(b)(2)(B) (requiring new evidence establishing that, \"but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense\"). Nor does it seem likely that Congress would have expected federal courts applying the tolling provision to construe \"post-conviction\" review to exclude state \"habeas\" petitions challenging convictions. The statute in which the words \"State post-conviction proceedings\" appear is a federal statute, and federal courts would be likely to apply those words to whatever state proceedings in fact fall within this federal description, whatever different labels different States might choose to attach. It is simpler, more meaningful, and just as logical to assume that Congress meant the words \"other collateral review\" to cast a wider net-a net wide enough to include federal collateral proceedings such as those that precede a dismissal for nonexhaustion.\r~    \r~    \r~      56\r~      Faced with this statutory ambiguity, I would look to statutory purposes in order to reach a proper interpretation. And, while I agree that Congress sought to \" 'further the principles of comity, finality, and federalism,' \" ante, at 10 (quoting Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 420, 436 (2000)), I would also ask whether Congress would have intended to create the kind of \"unexhausted petition\" problem that I described at the outset. The answer is no. Congress enacted a statute that all agree gave state prisoners a full year (plus the duration of state collateral proceedings) to file a federal habeas corpus petition. Congress would not have intended to shorten that time dramatically, at random, and perhaps erase it altogether, \"den[ying] the petitioner the protections of the Great Writ entirely,\" Lonchar v. Thomas, 517 U.S. 314, 324 (1996), simply because the technical nature of the habeas rules led a prisoner initially to file a petition in the wrong court.\r~    \r~    \r~      57\r~      The majority's argument assumes a congressional desire to strengthen the prisoners' incentive to file in state court first. But that is not likely to be the result of today's holding. After all, virtually every state prisoner already knows that he must first exhaust state-court remedies; and I imagine that virtually all of them now try to do so. The problem arises because the vast majority of federal habeas petitions are brought without legal representation. See Federal Habeas Corpus Review 14 (finding that 93% of habeas petitioners in study were pro se). Prisoners acting pro se will often not know whether a change in wording between state and federal petitions will be seen in federal court as a new claim or a better way of stating an old one; and they often will not understand whether new facts brought forward in the federal petition reflect a new claim or better support for an old one. Insofar as that is so, the Court's approach is likely to lead not to fewer improper federal petitions, but to increased confusion, as prisoners hesitate to change the language of state petitions or add facts, and to greater unfairness. And it will undercut one significant purpose of the provision before us-to grant state prisoners a fair and reasonable time to bring a first federal habeas corpus petition.\r~    \r~    \r~      58\r~      Nor is it likely that prisoners will deliberately seek to delay by repeatedly filing unexhausted petitions in federal court, as the Court suggests. See ante, at 12. First, prisoners not under a sentence of death (the vast majority of habeas petitioners) have no incentive to delay adjudication of their claims. Rather, \"[t]he prisoner's principal interest ... is in obtaining speedy federal relief.\" Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S., at 520. Second, the prisoner who chooses to go into federal court with unexhausted claims runs the risk that the district court will simply deny those claims on the merits, as it is permitted to do, see 28 U.S.C.  2254(b)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. V), before the prisoner has had the opportunity to develop a record in state court. Third, district courts have the power to prevent vexatious repeated filings by, for instance, ordering that a petition filed after a mixed petition is dismissed must contain only exhausted claims. See Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 489 (2000). Thus, the interest in reducing \"piecemeal litigation,\" ante, at 12, is not likely to be significantly furthered by the majority's holding.\r~    \r~    \r~      59\r~      Finally, the majority's construction of the statute will not necessarily promote comity. Federal courts, understanding that dismissal for nonexhaustion may mean the loss of any opportunity for federal habeas review, may tend to read ambiguous earlier state-court proceedings as having adequately exhausted a federal petition's current claims. For similar reasons, wherever possible, they may reach the merits of a federal petition's claims without sending the petitioner back to state court for exhaustion. To that extent, the majority's interpretation will result in a lesser, not a greater, respect for the state interests to which the majority refers. In addition, by creating pressure to expedite consideration of habeas petitions and to reach the merits of arguably exhausted claims, it will impose a heavier burden on the district courts. (While Justice Stevens' sound suggestions that district courts hold mixed petitions in abeyance and employ equitable tolling, see ante, at 1-3 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment), would properly ameliorate some of the unfairness of the majority's interpretation, they will also add to the burdens on the district courts in a way that simple tolling for federal habeas petitions would not.)\r~    \r~    \r~      60\r~      In two recent cases, we have assumed that Congress did not want to deprive state prisoners of first federal habeas corpus review, and we have interpreted statutory ambiguities accordingly. In Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal, 523 U.S. 637 (1998), we held that a federal habeas petition filed after the initial filing was dismissed as premature should not be deemed a \"second or successive\" petition barred by 2244, lest \"dismissal . . . for technical procedural reasons ... bar the prisoner from ever obtaining federal habeas review.\" Id., at 645. And in Slack v. McDaniel, we held that a federal habeas petition filed after dismissal of an initial filing for nonexhaustion should not be deemed a \"second or successive petition,\" lest \"the complete exhaustion rule\" become a \" 'trap' \" for \" 'the unwary pro se prisoner.' \" 529 U.S., at 487 (quoting Rose, supra, at 520). Making the same assumption here, I would interpret the ambiguous provision before us to permit tolling for federal habeas petitions.\r~    \r~    \r~      61\r~      In both Martinez-Villareal and Slack, the Court discerned the purpose of an ambiguous statutory provision by assuming that (absent a contrary indication) congressional purpose would mirror that of most reasonable human beings knowledgeable about the area of the law in question. And the Court kept those purposes firmly and foremost in mind as it sought to understand the statute. See Slack, supra, at 486-487; Martinez-Villareal, supra, at 644 (refusing to adopt an interpretation whose \"implications for habeas practice would be far reaching and seemingly perverse\"). Today it takes a different approach-an approach that looks primarily, though not exclusively, to linguistic canons to dispel the uncertainties caused by ambiguity. Where statutory language is ambiguous, I believe these priorities are misplaced. Language, dictionaries, and canons, unilluminated by purpose, can lead courts into blind alleys, producing rigid interpretations that can harm those whom the statute affects. If generalized, the approach, bit by bit, will divorce law from the needs, lives, and values of those whom it is meant to serve-a most unfortunate result for a people who live their lives by law's light. The Court was right in Martinez-Villareal and Slack to see purpose as key to the statute's meaning and to understand Congress as intending the same; it is wrong to reverse its interpretive priorities here.\r~    \r~    \r~      62\r~      With respect, I dissent.\r~    \r~    ",

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.CEDRIC KUSHNER PROMOTIONS, LTD., PETITIONERv.DON KING et al.SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    No. 00-549.~    Argued April 18, 2001Decided June 11, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      Petitioner, a corporate promoter of boxing matches, sued Don King, the president and sole shareholder of a rival corporation, alleging that King had conducted his corporation's affairs in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, which makes it \"unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise ... to conduct or participate ... in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity,\" 18 U.S.C.  1962(c). The District Court, citing Circuit precedent, dismissed the complaint. In affirming, the Second Circuit expressed its view that 1962(c) applies only where a plaintiff shows the existence of two separate entities, a \"person\" and a distinct \"enterprise,\" the affairs of which that \"person\" improperly conducts. In this instance, the court noted, it was undisputed that King was an employee of his corporation and also acting within the scope of his authority. Under the court's analysis, King, in a legal sense, was part of the corporation, not a \"person,\" distinct from the \"enterprise,\" who allegedly improperly conducted the \"enterprise's affairs.\"~      Held: In the circumstances of this case, 1962(c) requires no more than the formal legal distinction between \"person\" and \"enterprise\" (namely, incorporation); hence, the provision applies when a corporate employee unlawfully conducts the affairs of the corporation of which he is the sole owner-whether he conducts those affairs within the scope, or beyond the scope, of corporate authority. This Court does not quarrel with the basic principle that to establish liability under 1962(c) one must allege and prove the existence of two distinct entities: (1) a \"person\"; and (2) an \"enterprise\" that is not simply the same \"person\" referred to by a different name. Nonetheless, the Court disagrees with the appellate court's application of that \"distinctness\" principle to the present circumstances, in which a corporate employee, acting within the scope of his authority, allegedly conducts the corporation's affairs in a RICO-forbidden way. The corporate owner/employee, a natural person, is distinct from the corporation itself, a legally different entity with different rights and responsibilities due to its different legal status. The Court can find nothing in RICO that requires more \"separateness\" than that. Linguistically speaking, an employee who conducts his corporation's affairs through illegal acts comes within 1962(c)'s terms forbidding any \"person\" unlawfully to conduct an \"enterprise,\" particularly when RICO explicitly defines \"person\" to include \"any individual ... capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property,\" and defines \"enterprise\" to include a \"corporation,\" 1961(3), (4). And, linguistically speaking, the employee and the corporation are different \"persons,\" even where the employee is the corporation's sole owner. Incorporation's basic purpose is to create a legal entity distinct from those natural individuals who created the corporation, who own it, or whom it employs. See, e.g., United States v. Bestfoods, 524 U.S. 51, 61-62. The precedent on which the Second Circuit relied involved significantly different circumstances from those here at issue. Further, to apply RICO in these circumstances is consistent with the statute's basic purposes of protecting both a legitimate \"enterprise\" from those who would use unlawful acts to victimize it, United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 591, and the public from those who would unlawfully use an \"enterprise\" (whether legitimate or illegitimate) as a \"vehicle\" through which unlawful activity is committed, National Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 510 U.S. 249, 259. Conversely, the appellate court's critical legal distinction-between employees acting within and without the scope of corporate authority-would immunize from RICO liability many of those at whom this Court has said RICO directly aims, e.g., high-ranking individuals in an illegitimate criminal enterprise, who, seeking to further the enterprise's purposes, act within the scope of their authority, cf. Turkette, supra, at 581. Finally, nothing in the statute's history significantly favors an alternative interpretation. This Court's rule is no less consistent than is the lower court's rule with the following principles cited by King: (1) the principle that a corporation acts only through its directors, officers, and agents; (2) the principle that a corporation should not be liable for its employees' criminal acts where Congress so intends; and (3) antitrust law's intracorporate conspiracy doctrine. Pp. 2-8.~      219 F.3d 115, reversed and remanded.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT~      Breyer, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C.  1961 et seq., makes it \"unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise ... to conduct or participate ... in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs\" through the commission of two or more statutorily defined crimes-which RICO calls \"a pattern of racketeering activity.\" 1962(c). The language suggests, and lower courts have held, that this provision fore- sees two separate entities, a \"person\" and a distinct \"enterprise.\"~    ~    ~      2~      This case focuses upon a person who is the president and sole shareholder of a closely held corporation. The plaintiff claims that the president has conducted the corporation's affairs through the forbidden \"pattern,\" though for present purposes it is conceded that, in doing so, he acted within the scope of his authority as the corporation's employee. In these circumstances, are there two entities, a \"person\" and a separate \"enterprise\"? Assuming, as we must given the posture of this case, that the allegations in the complaint are true, we conclude that the \"person\" and \"enterprise\" here are distinct and that the RICO provision applies.~    ~    ~      3~      Petitioner, Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd., is a corporation that promotes boxing matches. Petitioner sued Don King, the president and sole shareholder of Don King Productions, a corporation, claiming that King had conducted the boxing-related affairs of Don King Productions in part through a RICO \"pattern,\" i.e., through the alleged commission of at least two instances of fraud and other RICO predicate crimes. The District Court, citing Court of Appeals precedent, dismissed the complaint. Civ. No. 98-6859, 1999 WL 771366, *3-4 (SDNY, Sept. 28, 1999). And the Court of Appeals affirmed that dismissal. 219 F.3d 115 (CA2 2000) (per curiam). In the appellate court's view, 1962(c) applies only where a plaintiff shows the existence of two separate entities, a \"person\" and a distinct \"enterprise,\" the affairs of which that \"person\" improperly conducts. Id., at 116. In this instance, \"it is undisputed that King was an employee\" of the corporation Don King Productions and also \"acting within the scope of his authority.\" Id., at 117. Under the Court of Appeals' analysis, King, in a legal sense, was part of, not separate from, the corporation. There was no \"person,\" distinct from the \"enterprise,\" who improperly conducted the \"enterprise's affairs.\" And thus 1962(c) did not apply. Ibid.~    ~    ~      4~      Other Circuits, applying 1962(c) in roughly similar circumstances, have reached a contrary conclusion. See, e.g., Brannon v. Boatmen's First Nat. Bank of Okla., 153 F.3d 1144, 1148, n. 4 (CA10 1998); Richmond v. Nationwide Cassel L. P., 52 F.3d 640, 647 (CA7 1995); Jaguar Cars, Inc. v. Royal Oaks Motor Car Co., 46 F.3d 258, 265, 269 (CA3 1995); Sever v. Alaska Pulp Corp., 978 F.2d 1529, 1534 (CA9 1992). We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. We now agree with these Circuits and hold that the Second Circuit's interpretation of 1962(c) is erroneous.~    ~    ~      5~      We do not quarrel with the basic principle that to establish liability under 1962(c) one must allege and prove the existence of two distinct entities: (1) a \"person\"; and (2) an \"enterprise\" that is not simply the same \"person\" referred to by a different name. The statute's language, read as ordinary English, suggests that principle. The Act says that it applies to \"person[s]\" who are \"employed by or associated with\" the \"enterprise.\" 1962(c). In ordinary English one speaks of employing, being employed by, or associating with others, not oneself. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 132 (1993) (defining \"associate\"); id., at 743 (defining \"employ\"). In addition, the Act's purposes are consistent with that principle. Whether the Act seeks to prevent a person from victimizing, say, a small business, S. Rep. No. 91-617, p. 77 (1969), or to prevent a person from using a corporation for criminal purposes, National Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 510 U.S. 249, 259 (1994), the person and the victim, or the person and the tool, are different entities, not the same.~    ~    ~      6~      The Acting Solicitor General reads 1962(c) \"to require some distinctness between the RICO defendant and the RICO enterprise.\" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 11. And she says that this requirement is \"legally sound and workable.\" Ibid. We agree with her assessment, particularly in light of the fact that 12 Courts of Appeals have interpreted the statute as embodying some such distinctness requirement without creating discernible mischief in the administration of RICO.

Indeed, this Court previously has said that liability \"depends on showing that the defendants conducted or participated in the conduct of the 'enterprise's affairs,' not just their own affairs.\" Reves v. Ernst  Young, 507 U.S. 170, 185 (1993).~    ~    ~      7~      While accepting the \"distinctness\" principle, we nonetheless disagree with the appellate court's application of that principle to the present circumstances-circumstances in which a corporate employee, \"acting within the scope of his authority,\" 219 F.3d, at 117, allegedly conducts the corporation's affairs in a RICO-forbidden way. The corporate owner/employee, a natural person, is distinct from the corporation itself, a legally different entity with different rights and responsibilities due to its different legal status. And we can find nothing in the statute that requires more \"separateness\" than that. Cf. McCullough v. Suter, 757 F.2d 142, 144 (CA7 1985) (finding either formal or practical separateness sufficient to be distinct under 1962(c)).~    ~    ~      8~      Linguistically speaking, an employee who conducts the affairs of a corporation through illegal acts comes within the terms of a statute that forbids any \"person\" unlawfully to conduct an \"enterprise,\" particularly when the statute explicitly defines \"person\" to include \"any individual ... capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property,\" and defines \"enterprise\" to include a \"corporation.\" 18 U.S.C.  1961(3), (4). And, linguistically speaking, the employee and the corporation are different \"persons,\" even where the employee is the corporation's sole owner. After all, incorporation's basic purpose is to create a distinct legal entity, with legal rights, obligations, powers, and privileges different from those of the natural individuals who created it, who own it, or whom it employs. See United States v. Bestfoods, 524 U.S. 51, 61-62 (1998); Burnet v. Clark, 287 U.S. 410, 415 (1932); 1 W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations 7, 14 (rev. ed. 1999).~    ~    ~      9~      We note that the Second Circuit relied on earlier Circuit precedent for its decision. But that precedent involved quite different circumstances which are not presented here. This case concerns a claim that a corporate employee is the \"person\" and the corporation is the \"enterprise.\" It is natural to speak of a corporate employee as a \"person employed by\" the corporation. 1962(c). The earlier Second Circuit precedent concerned a claim that a corporation was the \"person\" and the corporation, together with all its employees and agents, were the \"enterprise.\" See Riverwoods Chappaqua Corp. v. Marine Midland Bank, N. A., 30 F.3d 339, 344 (1994) (affirming dismissal of complaint). It is less natural to speak of a corporation as \"employed by\" or \"associated with\" this latter oddly constructed entity. And the Second Circuit's other precedent also involved significantly different allegations compared with the instant case. See Anatian v. Coutts Bank (Switzerland) Ltd., 193 F.3d 85, 89 (1999) (affirming dismissal where plaintiff alleged that same bank was both \"person\" and \"enterprise\"), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1188 (2000); Discon, Inc. v. NYNEX Corp., 93 F.3d 1055, 1064 (1996) (involving complaint alleging that corporate subsidiaries were \"persons\" and subsidiaries, taken together as parent, were \"enterprise\"), vacated on other grounds, 525 U.S. 128 (1998); Bennett, supra, at 315, and n. 2 (same as Anatian). We do not here consider the merits of these cases, and note only their distinction from the instant case.~    ~    ~      10~      Further, to apply the RICO statute in present circumstances is consistent with the statute's basic purposes as this Court has defined them. The Court has held that RICO both protects a legitimate \"enterprise\" from those who would use unlawful acts to victimize it, United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 591 (1981), and also protects the public from those who would unlawfully use an \"enterprise\" (whether legitimate or illegitimate) as a \"vehicle\" through which \"unlawful ... activity is committed,\" National Organization for Women, Inc., 510 U.S., at 259. A corporate employee who conducts the corporation's affairs through an unlawful RICO \"pattern . . . of activity,\" 1962(c), uses that corporation as a \"vehicle\" whether he is, or is not, its sole owner.~    ~    ~      11~      Conversely, the appellate court's critical legal distinction-between employees acting within the scope of corporate authority and those acting outside that authority-is inconsistent with a basic statutory purpose. Cf. Reves, supra, at 184 (stating that an enterprise is \" 'operated,' \" within 1962(c)'s meaning, \"not just by upper management but also by lower rung participants in the enterprise who are under the direction of upper management\" (emphasis added)). It would immunize from RICO liability many of those at whom this Court has said RICO directly aims-e.g., high-ranking individuals in an illegitimate criminal enterprise, who, seeking to further the purposes of that enterprise, act within the scope of their authority. Cf. Turkette, supra, at 581 (Congress \"did nothing to indicate that an enterprise consisting of a group of individuals was not covered by RICO if the purpose of the enterprise was exclusively criminal\").~    ~    ~      12~      Finally, we have found nothing in the statute's history that significantly favors an alternative interpretation. That history not only refers frequently to the importance of undermining organized crime's influence upon legitimate businesses but also refers to the need to protect the public from those who would run \"organization[s] in a manner detrimental to the public interest.\" S. Rep. No. 91-617, at 82. This latter purpose, as we have said, invites the legal principle we endorse, namely, that in present circumstances the statute requires no more than the formal legal distinction between \"person\" and \"enterprise\" (namely, incorporation) that is present here.~    ~    ~      13~      In reply, King argues that the lower court's rule is consistent with (1) the principle that a corporation acts only through its directors, officers, and agents, 1 Fletcher, supra, 30, (2) the principle that a corporation should not be liable for the criminal acts of its employees where Congress so intends, Brief for Respondents 20-21, and (3) the Sherman Act principle limiting liability under 15 U.S.C.  1 by excluding \"from unlawful combinations or conspiracies the activities of a single firm,\" Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 769-770, n. 15 (1984). The alternative that we endorse, however, is no less consistent with these principles. It does not deny that a corporation acts through its employees; it says only that the corporation and its employees are not legally identical. It does not assert that ordinary respondeat superior principles make a corporation legally liable under RICO for the criminal acts of its employees; that is a matter of congressional intent not before us. See, e.g., Gasoline Sales, Inc., 39 F.3d, at 73 (holding that corporation cannot be \"vicariously liable\" for 1962(c) violations committed by its vice president). Neither is it inconsistent with antitrust law's intracorporate conspiracy doctrine; that doctrine turns on specific antitrust objectives. See Copperweld Corp., supra, at 770-771. Rather, we hold simply that the need for two distinct entities is satisfied; hence, the RICO provision before us applies when a corporate employee unlawfully conducts the affairs of the corporation of which he is the sole owner-whether he conducts those affairs within the scope, or beyond the scope, of corporate authority.~    ~    ~      14~      For these reasons, the Court of Appeals' judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      15~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ",

KATZ and IN DEFENSE OF ANIMALS~    No. 99-1977.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued March 20, 2001Decided June 18, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      Respondent Katz, president of respondent In Defense of Animals, filed a suit pursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388, against, inter alios, petitioner Saucier, a military policeman. Katz alleged, among other things, that Saucier had violated his Fourth Amendment rights by using excessive force in arresting him while he protested during Vice President Gore's speech at a San Francisco army base. The District Court declined to grant Saucier summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds. In affirming, the Ninth Circuit made a two-part qualified immunity inquiry. First, it found that the law governing Saucier's conduct was clearly established when the incident occurred. It therefore moved to a second step: to determine if a reasonable officer could have believed, in light of the clearly established law, that his conduct was lawful. The court concluded that this step and the merits of a Fourth Amendment excessive force claim are identical, since both concern the objective reasonableness of the officer's conduct in light of the circumstances the officer faced at the scene. Thus, it found, summary judgment based on qualified immunity was inappropriate.~      Held:   1. A qualified immunity ruling requires an analysis not susceptible of fusion with the question whether unreasonable force was used in making the arrest. The Ninth Circuit's approach cannot be reconciled with Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635. A qualified immunity defense must be considered in proper sequence. A ruling should be made early in the proceedings so that the cost and expenses of trial are avoided where the defense is dispositive. Such immunity is an entitlement not to stand trial, not a defense from liability. Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526. The initial inquiry is whether a constitutional right would have been violated on the facts alleged, for if no right would have been violated, there is no need for further inquiry into immunity. However, if a violation could be made out on a favorable view of the parties' submissions, the next, sequential step is whether the right was clearly established. This inquiry must be undertaken in light of the case's specific context, not as a broad general proposition. The relevant, dispositive inquiry is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that the conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted. See Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 615. The Ninth Circuit's approach-to deny summary judgment if a material issue of fact remains on the excessive force claim-could undermine the goal of qualified immunity to avoid excessive disruption of government and permit the resolution of many insubstantial claims on summary judgment. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818. If the law did not put the officer on notice that his conduct would be clearly unlawful, summary judgment based on qualified immunity is appropriate. The Ninth Circuit concluded that qualified immunity is duplicative in an excessive force case, thus eliminating the need for the second step. In holding that qualified immunity applied in the Fourth Amendment context just as it would for any other official misconduct claim, the Anderson Court rejected the argument that there is no distinction between the reasonableness standard for warrantless searches and the qualified immunity inquiry. In an attempt to distinguish Anderson, Katz claims that the subsequent Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, decision set forth an excessive force analysis indistinguishable from qualified immunity, thus rendering the separate immunity inquiry superfluous and inappropriate in such cases. Contrary to his arguments, the immunity and excessive force inquiries remain distinct after Graham. Graham sets forth factors relevant to the merits of a constitutional excessive force claim, which include the severity of the crime, whether the suspect poses a threat to the officers or others, and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight. Id., at 396. If an officer reasonably, but mistakenly, believed that a suspect was likely to fight back, for instance, the officer would be justified in using more force than in fact was needed. The qualified immunity inquiry's concern, on the other hand, is to acknowledge that reasonable mistakes can be made as to the legal constraints on particular police conduct. An officer might correctly perceive all of the relevant facts, but have a mistaken understanding as to whether a particular amount of force is legal in those circumstances. Pp. 4-11.~      2. Petitioner was entitled to qualified immunity. Assuming that a constitutional violation occurred under the facts alleged, the question is whether this general prohibition was the source for clearly established law that was contravened in the circumstances. In the circumstances presented to petitioner, which included the duty to protect the Vice President's safety and security from persons unknown in number, there was no clearly established rule prohibiting him from acting as he did. This conclusion is confirmed by the uncontested fact that the force used-dragging Katz from the area and shoving him while placing him into a van-was not so excessive that respondent suffered hurt or injury. Pp. 11-14.~      194 F.3d 962, reversed and remanded.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT~      Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor, Scalia, and Thomas, JJ., joined, and in which Souter, J., joined as to Parts I and II.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      In this case a citizen alleged excessive force was used to arrest him. The arresting officer asserted the defense of qualified immunity. The matter we address is whether the requisite analysis to determine qualified immunity is so intertwined with the question whether the officer used excessive force in making the arrest that qualified immunity and constitutional violation issues should be treated as one question, to be decided by the trier of fact. The Court of Appeals held the inquiries do merge into a single question. We now reverse and hold that the ruling on qualified immunity requires an analysis not susceptible of fusion with the question whether unreasonable force was used in making the arrest. I   In autumn of 1994, the Presidio Army Base in San Francisco was the site of an event to celebrate conversion of the base to a national park. Among the speakers was Vice President Albert Gore, Jr., who attracted several hundred observers from the military and the general public. Some in attendance were not on hand to celebrate, however. Respondent Elliot Katz was concerned that the Army's Letterman Hospital would be used for conducting experiments on animals. (Katz was president of a group called In Defense of Animals. Although both he and the group are respondents here, the issues we discuss center upon Katz, and we refer to him as \"respondent\"). To voice opposition to the possibility that the hospital might be used for experiments, respondent brought with him a cloth banner, approximately 4 by 3 feet, that read \"Please Keep Animal Torture Out of Our National Parks.\" In the past, as respondent was aware, members of the public had been asked to leave the military base when they engaged in certain activities, such as distributing handbills; and he kept the banner concealed under his jacket as he walked through the base.~    ~    ~      2~      The area designated for the speakers contained seating for the general public, separated from the stage by a waist-high fence. Respondent sat in the front row of the public seating area. At about the time Vice President Gore began speaking, respondent removed the banner from his jacket, started to unfold it, and walked toward the fence and speakers' platform.~    ~    ~      3~      Petitioner Donald Saucier is a military police officer who was on duty that day. He had been warned by his superiors of the possibility of demonstrations, and respondent had been identified as a potential protestor. Petitioner and Sergeant Steven Parker-also a military police officer, but not a party to the suit-recognized respondent and moved to intercept him as he walked toward the fence. As he reached the barrier and began placing the banner on the other side, the officers grabbed respondent from behind, took the banner, and rushed him out of the area. Each officer had one of respondent's arms, half-walking, half-dragging him, with his feet \"barely touching the ground.\" App. 24. Respondent was wearing a visible, knee-high leg brace, although petitioner later testified he did not remember noticing it at the time. Saucier and Parker took respondent to a nearby military van, where, respondent claims, he was shoved or thrown inside. Id., at 25. The reason for the shove remains unclear. It seems agreed that respondent placed his feet somewhere on the outside of the van, perhaps the bumper, but there is a dispute whether he did so to resist. As a result of the shove, respondent claims, he fell to the floor of the van, where he caught himself just in time to avoid any injury. The officers drove respondent to a military police station, held him for a brief time, and then released him. Though the details are not clear, it appears that at least one other protestor was also placed into the van and detained for a brief time. Id., at 27.~    ~    ~      4~      Respondent brought this action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against petitioner and other officials pursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), alleging, inter alia, that defendants had violated respondent's Fourth Amendment rights by using excessive force to arrest him. The District Court granted the defendants' motions for summary judgment on the grounds of qualified immunity on all claims other than the excessive force claim against Saucier. It held a dispute on a material fact existed concerning whether excessive force was used to remove respondent from the crowd and place him into the van. App. to Pet. for Cert. 27a. The District Court held that the law governing excessive force claims was clearly established at the time of the arrest, and that \"[i]n the Fourth Amendment context, the qualified immunity inquiry is the same as the inquiry made on the merits.\" Id., at 29a-30a. As a result, it ruled, petitioner was not entitled to summary judgment. Id., at 30a.~    ~    ~      5~      In the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit petitioner filed an interlocutory appeal from the denial of qualified immunity. 194 F.3d 962 (1999). The Court of Appeals affirmed, noting at the outset its two-part analysis for qualified immunity questions. First, the Court of Appeals considers \"whether the law governing the official's conduct was clearly established.\" Id., at 967. If it was not, that ends the matter, and the official is entitled to immunity. If, however, the law was clearly established when the conduct occurred, the Court of Appeals' second step is to determine if a reasonable officer could have believed, in light of the clearly established law, that his conduct was lawful. Ibid. As to the first step of its analysis, the court observed that Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386 (1989), sets forth the objective reasonableness test for evaluating excessive force claims, a principle the Court of Appeals concluded was clearly established for qualified immunity purposes. The court then concluded that the second step of the qualified immunity inquiry and the merits of the Fourth Amendment excessive force claim are identical, since both concern the objective reasonableness of the officer's conduct in light of the circumstances the officer faced on the scene. 194 F.3d, at 968. On this reasoning, summary judgment based on qualified immunity was held inappropriate. Id., at 968-969.~    ~    ~      6~      Saucier, represented by the Government of the United States, sought review here, arguing the Court of Appeals erred in its view that the qualified immunity inquiry is the same as the constitutional inquiry and so becomes superfluous or duplicative when excessive force is alleged. We granted certiorari, 531 U.S. 991 (2000).~    ~    II~    ~      7~      The Court of Appeals ruled first that the right was clearly established; and second that the reasonableness inquiry into excessive force meant that it need not consider aspects of qualified immunity, leaving the whole matter to the jury. 194 F.3d, at 967. This approach cannot be reconciled with Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635 (1987), however, and was in error in two respects. As we shall explain, the first inquiry must be whether a constitutional right would have been violated on the facts alleged; second, assuming the violation is established, the question whether the right was clearly established must be considered on a more specific level than recognized by the Court of Appeals.~    ~    ~      8~      In a suit against an officer for an alleged violation of a constitutional right, the requisites of a qualified immunity defense must be considered in proper sequence. Where the defendant seeks qualified immunity, a ruling on that issue should be made early in the proceedings so that the costs and expenses of trial are avoided where the defense is dispositive. Qualified immunity is \"an entitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation.\" Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985). The privilege is \"an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability; and like an absolute immunity, it is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.\" Ibid. As a result, \"we repeatedly have stressed the importance of resolving immunity questions at the earliest possible stage in litigation.\" Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 227 (1991) (per curiam).~    ~    ~      9~      A court required to rule upon the qualified immunity issue must consider, then, this threshold question: Taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officer's conduct violated a constitutional right? This must be the initial inquiry. Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 232 (1991). In the course of determining whether a constitutional right was violated on the premises alleged, a court might find it necessary to set forth principles which will become the basis for a holding that a right is clearly established. This is the process for the law's elaboration from case to case, and it is one reason for our insisting upon turning to the existence or nonexistence of a constitutional right as the first inquiry. The law might be deprived of this explanation were a court simply to skip ahead to the question whether the law clearly established that the officer's conduct was unlawful in the circumstances of the case.~    ~    ~      10~      If no constitutional right would have been violated were the allegations established, there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity. On the other hand, if a violation could be made out on a favorable view of the parties' submissions, the next, sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly established. This inquiry, it is vital to note, must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition; and it too serves to advance understanding of the law and to allow officers to avoid the burden of trial if qualified immunity is applicable.~    ~    ~      11~      In this litigation, for instance, there is no doubt that Graham v. Connor, supra, clearly establishes the general proposition that use of force is contrary to the Fourth Amendment if it is excessive under objective standards of reasonableness. Yet that is not enough. Rather, we emphasized in Anderson \"that the right the official is alleged to have violated must have been 'clearly established' in a more particularized, and hence more relevant, sense: The contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.\" 483 U.S., at 640. The relevant, dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted. See Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 615 (1999) (\"[A]s we explained in Anderson, the right allegedly violated must be defined at the appropriate level of specificity before a court can determine if it was clearly established\").~    ~    ~      12~      The approach the Court of Appeals adopted-to deny summary judgment any time a material issue of fact remains on the excessive force claim-could undermine the goal of qualified immunity to \"avoid excessive disruption of government and permit the resolution of many insubstantial claims on summary judgment.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982). If the law did not put the officer on notice that his conduct would be clearly unlawful, summary judgment based on qualified immunity is appropriate. See Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341 (1986) (qualified immunity protects \"all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law\").~    ~    ~      13~      This is not to say that the formulation of a general rule is beside the point, nor is it to insist the courts must have agreed upon the precise formulation of the standard. Assuming, for instance, that various courts have agreed that certain conduct is a constitutional violation under facts not distinguishable in a fair way from the facts presented in the case at hand, the officer would not be entitled to qualified immunity based simply on the argument that courts had not agreed on one verbal formulation of the controlling standard.~    ~    ~      14~      The Court of Appeals concluded that qualified immunity is merely duplicative in an excessive force case, eliminating the need for the second step where a constitutional violation could be found based on the allegations. In Anderson, a warrantless search case, we rejected the argument that there is no distinction between the reasonableness standard for warrantless searches and the qualified immunity inquiry. We acknowledged there was some \"surface appeal\" to the argument that, because the Fourth Amendment's guarantee was a right to be free from \"unreasonable\" searches and seizures, it would be inconsistent to conclude that an officer who acted unreasonably under the constitutional standard nevertheless was entitled to immunity because he \" 'reasonably' acted unreasonably.\" 483 U.S., at 643. This superficial similarity, however, could not overcome either our history of applying qualified immunity analysis to Fourth Amendment claims against officers or the justifications for applying the doctrine in an area where officers perform their duties with considerable uncertainty as to \"whether particular searches or seizures comport with the Fourth Amendment.\" Id., at 644. With respect, moreover, to the argument made in Anderson that an exception should be made for Fourth Amendment cases, we observed \"the heavy burden this argument must sustain to be successful,\" since \"the doctrine of qualified immunity reflects a balance that has been struck 'across the board.' \" Id., at 642 (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, supra, at 821). We held that qualified immunity applied in the Fourth Amendment context just as it would for any other claim of official misconduct. 483 U.S., at 644.~    ~    ~      15~      Faced, then, with the heavy burden of distinguishing Anderson and of carving out an exception to the typical qualified immunity analysis applied in other Fourth Amendment contexts, the primary submission by respondent in defense of the Court of Appeals' decision is that our decision in Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386 (1989), somehow changes matters. Graham, in respondent's view, sets forth an excessive force analysis indistinguishable from qualified immunity, rendering the separate immunity inquiry superfluous and inappropriate. Respondent asserts that, like the qualified immunity analysis applicable in other contexts, the excessive force test already affords officers latitude for mistaken beliefs as to the amount of force necessary, so that \"Graham has addressed for the excessive force area most of the concerns expressed in Anderson.\" Brief for Respondents 7. Respondent points out that Graham did not address the interaction of excessive force claims and qualified immunity, since the issue was not raised, see 490 U.S., at 399, n. 12; and respondent seeks to distinguish Anderson on the theory that the issue of probable cause implicates evolving legal standards and resulting legal uncertainty, a subject raising recurrent questions of qualified immunity. By contrast, respondent says, excessive force is governed by the standard established in Graham, a standard providing ample guidance for particular situations. Finally, respondent adopts the suggestion made by one Court of Appeals that the relevant distinction is that probable cause is an ex post inquiry, whereas excessive force, like qualified immunity, should be evaluated from an ex ante perspective. See Finnegan v. Fountain, 915 F.2d 817, 824, n. 11 (CA2 1990).~    ~    ~      16~      These arguments or attempted distinctions cannot bear the weight respondent seeks to place upon them. Graham did not change the qualified immunity framework explained in Anderson. The inquiries for qualified immunity and excessive force remain distinct, even after Graham.~    ~    ~      17~      In Graham, we held that claims of excessive force in the context of arrests or investigatory stops should be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment's \"objective reasonableness standard,\" not under substantive due process principles. 490 U.S., at 388, 394. Because \"police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments-in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving-about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation,\" id., at 397, the reasonableness of the officer's belief as to the appropriate level of force should be judged from that on-scene perspective. Id., at 396. We set out a test that cautioned against the \"20/20 vision of hindsight\" in favor of deference to the judgment of reasonable officers on the scene. Id., at 393, 396. Graham sets forth a list of factors relevant to the merits of the constitutional excessive force claim, \"requir[ing] careful attention to the facts and circumstances of each particular case, including the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\" Id., at 396. If an officer reasonably, but mistakenly, believed that a suspect was likely to fight back, for instance, the officer would be justified in using more force than in fact was needed.~    ~    ~      18~      The qualified immunity inquiry, on the other hand, has a further dimension. The concern of the immunity inquiry is to acknowledge that reasonable mistakes can be made as to the legal constraints on particular police conduct. It is sometimes difficult for an officer to determine how the relevant legal doctrine, here excessive force, will apply to the factual situation the officer confronts. An officer might correctly perceive all of the relevant facts but have a mistaken understanding as to whether a particular amount of force is legal in those circumstances. If the officer's mistake as to what the law requires is reasonable, however, the officer is entitled to the immunity defense.~    ~    ~      19~      Graham does not always give a clear answer as to whether a particular application of force will be deemed excessive by the courts. This is the nature of a test which must accommodate limitless factual circumstances. This reality serves to refute respondent's claimed distinction between excessive force and other Fourth Amendment contexts; in both spheres the law must be elaborated from case to case. Qualified immunity operates in this case, then, just as it does in others, to protect officers from the sometimes \"hazy border between excessive and acceptable force,\" Priester v. Riviera Beach, 208 F.3d 919, 926-927 (CA11 2000), and to ensure that before they are subjected to suit, officers are on notice their conduct is unlawful.~    ~    ~      20~      Graham and Anderson refute the excessive force/probable cause distinction on which much of respondent's position seems to depend. The deference owed officers facing suits for alleged excessive force is not different in some qualitative respect from the probable cause inquiry in Anderson. Officers can have reasonable, but mistaken, beliefs as to the facts establishing the existence of probable cause or exigent circumstances, for example, and in those situations courts will not hold that they have violated the Constitution. Yet, even if a court were to hold that the officer violated the Fourth Amendment by conducting an unreasonable, warrantless search, Anderson still operates to grant officers immunity for reasonable mistakes as to the legality of their actions. The same analysis is applicable in excessive force cases, where in addition to the deference officers receive on the underlying constitutional claim, qualified immunity can apply in the event the mistaken belief was reasonable.~    ~    ~      21~      The temporal perspective of the inquiry, whether labeled as ex ante or ex post, offers no meaningful distinction between excessive force and other Fourth Amendment suits. Graham recognized as much, reviewing several of our probable cause and search warrant cases, then stating that \"[w]ith respect to a claim of excessive force, the same standard of reasonableness at the moment applies.\" 490 U.S., at 396 (discussing use of force under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968); probable cause to arrest under Hill v. California, 401 U.S. 797 (1971); and search warrant requirements under Maryland v. Garrison, 480 U.S. 79 (1987)); see also Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S., at 228 (\"Probable cause existed if 'at the moment the arrest was made . . . the facts and circumstances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing' \" a crime had been committed (quoting Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 91 (1964))). Excessive force claims, like most other Fourth Amendment issues, are evaluated for objective reasonableness based upon the information the officers had when the conduct occurred.~    ~    III~    ~      22~      The case was presented to the Court of Appeals on the assumption that respondent's seizure and brief detention did not violate clearly established First Amendment privileges and did not violate the Fourth Amendment right to be free from arrest without probable cause, as distinct from the force used to detain. The sole question, then, is whether the force used violated a clearly established Fourth Amendment protection so that petitioner was not entitled to immunity.~    ~    ~      23~      Our instruction to the district courts and courts of appeal to concentrate at the outset on the definition of the constitutional right and to determine whether, on the facts alleged, a constitutional violation could be found is important. As we have said, the procedure permits courts in appropriate cases to elaborate the constitutional right with greater degrees of specificity. Because we granted certiorari only to determine whether qualified immunity was appropriate, however, and because of the limits imposed upon us by the questions on which we granted review, we will assume a constitutional violation could have occurred under the facts alleged based simply on the general rule prohibiting excessive force, then proceed to the question whether this general prohibition against excessive force was the source for clearly established law that was contravened in the circumstances this officer faced. There was no contravention under this standard. Though it is doubtful that the force used was excessive, we need not rest our conclusion on that determination. The question is what the officer reasonably understood his powers and responsibilities to be, when he acted, under clearly established standards.~    ~    ~      24~      Respondent's excessive force claim for the most part depends upon the \"gratuitously violent shove\" allegedly received when he was placed into the van, although respondent notes as well that the alleged violation resulted from the \"totality of the circumstances,\" including the way he was removed from the speaking area. See Brief for Respondents 3, n. 2.~    ~    ~      25~      These circumstances, however, disclose substantial grounds for the officer to have concluded he had legitimate justification under the law for acting as he did. In Graham we noted that \"[o]ur Fourth Amendment jurisprudence has long recognized that the right to make an arrest or investigatory stop necessarily carries with it the right to use some degree of physical coercion or threat thereof to effect it.\" 490 U.S., at 396. A reasonable officer in petitioner's position could have believed that hurrying respondent away from the scene, where the Vice President was speaking and respondent had just approached the fence designed to separate the public from the speakers, was within the bounds of appropriate police responses.~    ~    ~      26~      Petitioner did not know the full extent of the threat respondent posed or how many other persons there might be who, in concert with respondent, posed a threat to the security of the Vice President. There were other potential protestors in the crowd, and at least one other individual was arrested and placed into the van with respondent. In carrying out the detention, as it has been assumed the officers had the right to do, petitioner was required to recognize the necessity to protect the Vice President by securing respondent and restoring order to the scene. It cannot be said there was a clearly established rule that would prohibit using the force petitioner did to place respondent into the van to accomplish these objectives.~    ~    ~      27~      As for the shove respondent received when he was placed into the van, those same circumstances show some degree of urgency. We have approved the observation that \"[n]ot every push or shove, even if it may later seem unnecessary in the peace of a judge's chambers, violates the Fourth Amendment.\" Ibid. (citations omitted). Pushes and shoves, like other police conduct, must be judged under the Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness.~    ~    ~      28~      In the circumstances presented to this officer, which included the duty to protect the safety and security of the Vice President of the United States from persons unknown in number, neither respondent nor the Court of Appeals has identified any case demonstrating a clearly established rule prohibiting the officer from acting as he did, nor are we aware of any such rule. Our conclusion is confirmed by the uncontested fact that the force was not so excessive that respondent suffered hurt or injury. On these premises, petitioner was entitled to qualified immunity, and the suit should have been dismissed at an early stage in the proceedings.~    ~    ~      29~      The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      30~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      31~      Ginsburg, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Stevens and Breyer, JJ., joined.~    ~    ~      32~      Souter, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.~    ~    ~      33~      Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Stevens and Justice Breyer join, concurring in the judgment.~    ~    ~      34~      In Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386 (1989), the Court announced and described an \"objective reasonableness\" standard to govern all claims that law enforcement officers, in violation of the Fourth Amendment, used excessive force in the course of an arrest. Measuring material facts of this case that are not subject to genuine dispute against the Graham standard, I conclude that officer Saucier's motion for summary judgment should have been granted. I therefore concur in the Court's judgment. However, I would not travel the complex route the Court lays out for lower courts.~    ~    ~      35~      Application of the Graham objective reasonableness standard is both necessary, under currently governing precedent, and, in my view, sufficient to resolve cases of this genre. The Court today tacks on to a Graham inquiry a second, overlapping objective reasonableness inquiry purportedly demanded by qualified immunity doctrine. The two-part test today's decision imposes holds large potential to confuse. Endeavors to bring the Court's abstract instructions down to earth, I suspect, will bear out what lower courts have already observed-paradigmatically, the determination of police misconduct in excessive force cases and the availability of qualified immunity both hinge on the same question: Taking into account the particular circumstances confronting the defendant officer, could a reasonable officer, identically situated, have believed the force employed was lawful? See, e.g., Roy v. Inhabitants of City of Lewiston, 42 F.3d 691, 695 (CA1 1994); Rowland v. Perry, 41 F.3d 167, 173 (CA4 1994). Nothing more and nothing else need be answered in this case.~    ~    ~      36~      * All claims that law enforcement officers have used excessive force in the course of an arrest, Graham made explicit, are to be judged \"under the Fourth Amendment and its 'reasonableness' standard, rather than under a 'substantive due process' approach.\" 490 U.S., at 395. Underlying intent or motive are not relevant to the inquiry; rather, \"the question is whether the officers' actions are 'objectively reasonable' in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them.\" Id., at 397. The proper perspective in judging an excessive force claim, Graham explained, is that of \"a reasonable officer on the scene\" and \"at the moment\" force was employed. Id., at 396. \"Not every push or shove,\" the Court cautioned, \"even if it may later seem unnecessary in the peace of a judge's chambers, violates the Fourth Amendment.\" Ibid. (citation omitted). \"The calculus of reasonableness\" must allow for the reality that \"police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments\" about the force a particular situation warrants \"in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving.\" Id., at 396-397.~    ~    ~      37~      Under Graham's instructions, the question in this case is whether officer Saucier, in light of the facts and circumstances confronting him, could have reasonably believed he acted lawfully. Here, as in the mine run of exces- sive force cases, no inquiry more complex than that is warranted.~    ~    ~      38~      Inspecting this case under Graham's lens, and without doubling the \"objectively reasonable\" inquiry, I agree that Katz's submissions were too slim to put officer Saucier to the burden of trial. As the Court points out, it is not genuinely in doubt that \"[a] reasonable officer in [Saucier's] position could have believed that hurrying [Katz] away from the scene ... was within the bounds of appropriate police responses.\" Ante, at 13. Katz's excessive force claim thus depended on the \"gratuitously violent shove\" he allegedly received. Ante, at 12-13; see Brief for Respondents 3, n. 2 (conceding that \"the gratuitous violent shove\" was essential to Katz's excessive force claim).~    ~    ~      39~      Yet Katz failed to proffer proof, after pretrial discovery, that Saucier, as distinguished from his fellow officer Parker,1 had a hand in the allegedly violent shove.2 Saucier, in his deposition, denied participating in any shove, see App. 39-40, while Katz, in his deposition, said, without elaborating: \"They [Parker and Saucier] pretty much threw me in. Just shoved me in,\" id., at 25. But critically, at no point did Katz say, specifically, that Saucier himself, and not only Parker, pushed or shoved.~    ~    ~      40~      Katz's reluctance directly to charge Saucier with pushing or shoving is understandable in view of a television news videotape of the episode Katz presented as an exhibit to his complaint. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 27a. The videotape shows that the shove, described by Katz as gratuitously violent, came from the officer on the right side of the police van, not from the officer positioned on the left side. It is undisputed that the officer on the right is Parker, the officer on the left, Saucier. See Pet. for Cert. 27-28, and n. 19; Brief for Petitioner 50, n. 26. Mindful of Graham's cautionary observation that \"[n]ot every push or shove, even if it may later seem unnecessary in the peace of a judge's chambers, violates the Fourth Amendment,\" 490 U.S., at 396 (citation omitted), and in view of Katz's failure to deny that the shove alleged to establish excessive force came from Parker alone, not from Saucier, I am persuaded that Katz tendered no triable excessive force claim against Saucier.3~    ~    II~    ~      41~      In the Court's opinion, Graham is inadequate to control adjudication of excessive force cases. Graham must be overlaid, the Court maintains, by a sequential qualified immunity inquiry. Ante, at 5. The Court instructs lower courts first to undertake what appears to be an unadorned Graham inquiry, i.e., to consider initially whether the parties' submissions, viewed favorably to the plaintiff, could show that the officer's conduct violated the Fourth Amendment. Ante, at 5, 6. If the plaintiff prevails on that \"threshold question,\" ante, at 5, the trial court is then to proceed to the \"dispositive [qualified immunity] inquiry,\" asking \"whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that the conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted,\" ante, at 6.4~    ~    ~      42~      In the instant case, however, the Court finds that procedural impediments stop it from considering first \"whether a constitutional right would have been violated on the facts alleged.\" Ante, at 5, 12. The Court therefore \"assume[s] a constitutional violation could have occurred,\" ante, at 12-i.e., it supposes a trier could have found that officer Saucier used force excessive under Graham's definition. Even so, the Court reasons, qualified immunity would shield Saucier because he could have \"concluded he had legitimate justification under the law for acting as he did.\" Ante, at 13.~    ~    ~      43~      Skipping ahead of the basic Graham (constitutional violation) inquiry it admonished lower courts to undertake at the outset, the Court failed to home in on the duplication inherent in its two-step scheme. As lower courts dealing with excessive force cases on the ground have recognized, however, this Court's decisions invoke \"the same 'objectively reasonable' standard in describing both the constitutional test of liability [citing Graham, 490 U.S., at 397], and the ... standard for qualified immunity [citing Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 639 (1987)].\" Roy, 42 F.3d, at 695; see Street v. Parham, 929 F.2d 537, 540 (CA10 1991) (describing excessive force case as one \"where the determination of liability and the availability of qualified immunity depend on the same findings\"). In other words, an officer who uses force that is objectively reasonable \"in light of the facts and circumstances confronting [him],\" Graham, 490 U.S., at 397, simultaneously meets the standard for qualified immunity, see ante, at 6, and the standard the Court set in Graham for a decision on the merits in his favor. Conversely, an officer whose conduct is objectively unreasonable under Graham should find no shelter under a sequential qualified immunity test.~    ~    ~      44~      Double counting \"objective reasonableness,\" the Court appears to suggest, ante, at 4-5, is demanded by Anderson, which twice restated that qualified immunity shields the conduct of officialdom \"across the board.\" 483 U.S., at 642, 645 (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S 800, 821 (1982) (Brennan, J., concurring)); see also Anderson, 483 U.S., at 643 (\"we have been unwilling to complicate qualified immunity analysis by making the scope or extent of immunity turn on the precise nature of various officials' duties or the precise character of the particular rights alleged to have been violated\"). As I see it, however, excessive force cases are not meet for Anderson's two-part test.~    ~    ~      45~      Anderson presented the question whether the particular search conducted without a warrant was supported by probable cause and exigent circumstances. The answer to such a question is often far from clear.5 Law in the area is constantly evolving and, correspondingly, variously interpreted. As aptly observed by the Second Circuit, \"even learned and experienced jurists have had difficulty in defining the rules that govern a determination of probable cause ... . As he tries to find his way in this thicket, the police officer must not be held to act at his peril.\" Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 456 F.2d 1339, 1348 (1972) (on remand). In this light, Anderson reasoned: \"Law enforcement officers whose judgments in making these difficult determinations [whether particular searches or seizures comport with the Fourth Amendment] are objectively legally reasonable should no more be held personally liable in damages than should officials making analogous determinations in other areas of law.\" 483 U.S., at 644 (emphasis added).~    ~    ~      46~      As the foregoing discussion indicates, however, \"excessive force\" typically is not an \"analogous determination.\" The constitutional issue whether an officer's use of force was reasonable in given circumstances routinely can be answered simply by following Graham's directions. In inquiring, under Graham, whether an officer's use of force was within a range of reasonable options, the decisionmaker is also (and necessarily) answering the question whether a reasonable officer \"could have believed\" his use of force \"to be lawful,\" Anderson, 483 U.S., at 638. See Street, 929 F.2d, at 541, n. 2 (because of difficulty of deciding probable-cause issues, the conduct of an officer may be objectively reasonable even if cause did not exist, but \"in excessive force cases, once a factfinder has determined that the force used was unnecessary under the circumstances, any question of objective reasonableness has also been foreclosed\").~    ~    ~      47~      The Court fears that dispensing with the duplicative qualified immunity inquiry will mean \"leaving the whole matter to the jury.\" Ante, at 4. Again, experience teaches otherwise. Lower courts, armed with Graham's directions, have not shied away from granting summary judgment to defendant officials in Fourth Amendment excessive force cases where the challenged conduct is objectively reasonable based on relevant, undisputed facts. See, e.g., Wilson v. Spain, 209 F.3d 713, 716 (CA8 2000) (\"address[ing] in one fell swoop both [defendant's] qualified immunity and the merits of [plaintiff's] Fourth Amendment [excessive force] claim\" and concluding officer's conduct was objectively reasonable in the circumstances, so summary judgment for officer was proper); Roy, 42 F.3d, at 695 (under single objective reasonableness test, district court properly granted summary judgment for defendant);6 Wardlaw v. Pickett, 1 F.3d 1297, 1303-1304 (CADC 1993) (same). Indeed, this very case, as I earlier explained, see supra, at 2-4, fits the summary judgment bill. Of course, if an excessive force claim turns on which of two conflicting stories best captures what happened on the street, Graham will not permit summary judgment in favor of the defendant official. And that is as it should be. When a plaintiff proffers evidence that the official subdued her with a chokehold even though she complied at all times with his orders, while the official proffers evidence that he used only stern words, a trial must be had. In such a case, the Court's two-step procedure is altogether inutile.~    ~    ~      48~      * * *~    ~    ~      49~      For the reasons stated, I concur in the Court's judgment, but not in the two-step inquiry the Court has ordered. Once it has been determined that an officer violated the Fourth Amendment by using \"objectively unreasonable\" force as that term is explained in Graham v. Connor, there is simply no work for a qualified immunity inquiry to do.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         Though named as a defendant, Parker was never served with the complaint, and therefore did not become a party to this litigation. See Brief for Petitioner 3, n. 4.~      ~      ~        2~         See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(e) (\"When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party's pleading, but the adverse party's response ... must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\").~      ~      ~        3~         As the Court observes, there is a dispute whether Katz was resisting arrest at the time he was placed in the van. Ante, at 3. That dispute is irrelevant, however, in view of the absence of any indication that Saucier employed excessive force in removing Katz from the site of the celebration and placing him in the van. See Rowland v. Perry, 41 F.3d 167, 174 (CA4 1994) (\"[d]isputed versions of the facts alone are not enough to warrant denial of summary judgment\").~      ~      ~        4~         The Court's observation that \"neither respondent nor the Court of Appeals ha[s] identified any case demonstrating a clearly established rule prohibiting the officer from acting as he did,\" ante, at 14, must be read in light of our previous caution that \"the very action in question [need not have] previously been held unlawful\" for a plaintiff to defeat qualified immunity, Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987).~      ~      ~        5~         Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603 (1999), is a prototypical case. There, the Court accorded qualified immunity to police who permitted the media to accompany them on a search of a house. The constitutionality of the ride-along practice was unsettled at the time of the incident-in-suit in Wilson, and remained so until this Court spoke.~      ~      ~        6~         Upholding summary judgment for a police officer who shot an armed, intoxicated, belligerently behaving arrestee, the First Circuit in Roy elaborated: \"[T]he Supreme Court intends to surround the police who make these on-the-spot choices in dangerous situations with a fairly wide zone of protection in close cases. Decisions from this circuit and other circuits are consistent with that view. And in close cases, a jury does not automatically get to second-guess these life and death decisions, even though the plaintiff has an expert and a plausible claim that the situation could better have been handled differently.\" 42 F.3d, at 695 (footnote omitted).~      ~    ~    ~      50~      Justice Souter, concurring in part and dissenting in part.~    ~    ~      51~      I join Parts I and II of the Court's opinion, but would remand the case for application of the qualified immunity standard.~    ~    ",

C.  20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections  may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.UNITED STATES, PETITIONERv.MEAD CORPORATION~    No. 99-1434.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued November 8, 2000Decided June 18, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States authorizes the United States  Customs Service to classify and fix the rate of duty on imports, under rules and  regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury. As relevant here, the  Secretary provides for tariff rulings before the entry of goods by regulations  authorizing \"ruling letters\" setting tariff classifications for particular  imports. Any of the 46 port-of-entry Customs offices and the Customs  Headquarters Office may issue such letters. Respondent imports \"day planners,\"  three-ring binders with pages for daily schedules, phone numbers and addresses,  a calendar, and suchlike. After classifying the planners as duty-free for  several years, Customs Headquarters issued a ruling letter classifying them as  bound diaries subject to tariff. Mead filed suit in the Court of International  Trade, which granted the Government summary judgment. In reversing, the Federal  Circuit found that ruling letters should not be treated like Customs  regulations, which receive the highest level of deference under Chevron U.S. A.  Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, because they are  not preceded by notice and comment as under the Administrative Procedure Act  (APA), do not carry the force of law, and are not intended to clarify  importers's rights and obligations beyond the specific case. The court gave no  deference at all to the ruling letter at issue.~      Held: Administrative implementation of a particular statutory provision  qualifies for Chevron deference when it appears that Congress delegated  authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and  that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the  exercise of such authority. Such delegation may be shown in a variety of ways,  as by an agency's power to engage in adjudication or notice-and-comment  rulemaking, or by some other indication of comparable congressional intent. A  Customs ruling letter has no claim to Chevron deference, but, under Skidmore v.  Swift  Co., 323 U.S. 134, it is eligible to claim respect according to its  persuasiveness. Pp. 7-19.~      (a) When Congress has explicitly left a gap for an agency to fill, there has  been any express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific  statutory provision by regulation, and any ensuing regulation is binding unless  procedurally defective, arbitrary or capricious in substance, or manifestly  contrary to the statute. Even in the absence of an express delegation of  authority on a particular question, agencies charged with applying a statute  necessarily make all sorts of interpretive choices, and while not all of those  choices bind judges to follow them, they may influence courts facing questions  the agencies have already answered. The weight accorded to an administrative  judgment \"will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the  validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later  pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if  lacking power to control.\" Skidmore, supra, at 140. In Chevron, this Court  identified a category of interpretive choices distinguished by an additional  reason for judicial deference, recognizing that Congress engages not only in  express, but also in implicit, delegation of specific interpretive authority. It  can be apparent from the agency's generally conferred authority and other  statutory circumstances that Congress would expect the agency to be able to  speak with the force of law when addressing ambiguity in the statute or fills in  a space in the enacted law, even one about which Congress did not have intent as  to a particular result. When circumstances implying such an expectation exist, a  reviewing court must accept the agency's position if Congress has not previously  spoken to the point at issue and the agency's interpretation is reasonable. A  very good indicator of delegation meriting Chevron treatment is express  congressional authorizations to engage in the rulemaking or adjudication process  that produces the regulations or rulings for which deference is claimed. Thus,  the overwhelming number of cases applying Chevron deference have reviewed the  fruits of notice-and-comment rulemaking or formal adjudication. Although the  fact that the tariff classification at issue was not a product of such formal  process does not alone bar Chevron's application, cf., e.g., NationsBank of N.  C., N. A. v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., 513 U.S. 251, 256-257, 263, there  are ample reasons to deny Chevron deference here. Pp. 7-12.~      (b) There is no indication on the statute's face that Congress meant to  delegate authority to Customs to issue classification rulings with the force of  law. Also, it is difficult to see in agency practice any indication that Customs  set out with a lawmaking pretense in mind, for it does not generally engage in  notice-and-comment practice and a letter's binding character as a ruling stops  short of third parties. Indeed, any suggestion that rulings intended to have the  force of law are being churned out at a rate of 10,000 a year at 46 offices is  self-refuting. Nor do statutory amendments effective after this case arose  reveal a new congressional objective of treating classification decisions  generally as rulemaking with force of law or suggest any intent to create a  Chevron patchwork of classification rules, some with force of law, some without.  In sum, classification rulings are best treated like \"interpretations contained  in policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines,\" Christensen  v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576, 587, and thus beyond the Chevron pale. Pp.  12-15.~      (c) This does not mean, however, that the letters are due no deference.  Chevron did not eliminate Skidmore's holding that an agency's interpretation may  merit some deference whatever its form, given the \"specialized experience and  broader investigations and information\" available to the agency, 323 U.S., at  139, and given the value of uniformity in its administrative and judicial  understandings of what a national law requires, id., at 140. There is room at  least to raise a Skidmore claim here, where the regulatory scheme is highly  detailed, and Customs can bring the benefit of specialized experience to bear on  this case's questions. The classification ruling may at least seek a respect  proportional to its \"power to persuade,\" Skidmore, supra, at 140, and may claim  the merit of its writer's thoroughness, logic and expertness, its fit with prior  interpretations, and any other sources of weight. Underlying this Court's  position is a choice about the best way to deal with the great variety of ways  in which the laws invest the Government's administrative arms with discretion,  and with procedures for exercising it, in giving meaning to Acts of Congress.  The Court said nothing in Chevron to eliminate Skidmore's recognition of various  justifications for deference depending on statutory circumstances and agency  action. Judicial responses to such action must continue to differentiate between  the two cases. Any Skidmore assessment here ought to be made in the first  instance by the lower courts.

J.,  and Stevens, O'Connor, Kennedy, Thomas, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      The question is whether a tariff classification ruling by the United States  Customs Service deserves judicial deference. The Federal Circuit rejected  Customs's invocation of Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense  Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), in support of such a ruling, to which it  gave no deference. We agree that a tariff classification has no claim to  judicial deference under Chevron, there being no indication that Congress  intended such a ruling to carry the force of law, but we hold that under  Skidmore v. Swift  Co., 323 U.S. 134 (1944), the ruling is eligible to claim  respect according to its persuasiveness.~    ~    ~      2~      * A~    ~    ~      3~      Imports are taxed under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States  (HTSUS), 19 U.S.C.  1202. Title 19 U.S.C.  1500(b) provides that Customs  \"shall, under rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary [of the  Treasury] ... fix the final classification and rate of duty applicable to ...  merchandise\" under the HTSUS. Section 1502(a) provides that~    ~    ~      4~      \"[t]he Secretary of the Treasury shall establish and promulgate such rules  and regulations not inconsistent with the law (including regulations  establishing procedures for the issuance of binding rulings prior  to the entry of the merchandise concerned), and may disseminate such information  as may be necessary  to secure a just, impartial, and uniform appraisement of imported merchandise  and the classification and assessment of duties thereon at the various ports of  entry.\"1~    ~    ~      5~      See also 1624 (general delegation to Secretary to issue rules and regulations  for the admission of goods).~    ~    ~      6~      The Secretary provides for tariff rulings before the entry of goods by  regulations authorizing \"ruling letters\" setting tariff classifications for  particular imports. 19 CFR  177.8 (2000). A ruling letter \"represents the official position of the Customs Service with respect to the  particular transaction or issue described therein and is binding on all Customs  Service personnel in accordance with the provisions of this section until  modified or revoked. In the absence of a change of practice or other  modification or revocation which affects the principle of the ruling set forth  in the ruling letter, that principle may be cited as authority in the  disposition of transactions involving the same circumstances.\" 177.9(a). After the transaction that gives it birth, a ruling letter is to \"be applied  only with respect to transactions involving articles identical to the sample  submitted with the ruling request or to articles whose description is identical  to the description set forth in the ruling letter.\" 177.9(b)(2). As a general  matter, such a letter is \"subject to modification or revocation without notice  to any person, except the person to whom the letter was addressed,\" 177.9(c),  and the regulations consequently provide that \"no other person should rely on  the ruling letter or assume that the principles of that ruling will be applied  in connection with any transaction other than the one described in the letter,\"  ibid. Since ruling letters respond to transactions of the moment, they are not  subject to notice and comment before being issued, may be published but need  only be made \"available for public inspection,\" 19 U.S.C.  1625(a), and, at the  time this action arose, could be modified without notice and comment under most  circumstances, 19 CFR  177.10(c) (2000).2 A broader notice-and-comment  requirement for modification of prior rulings was added by statute in 1993, Pub.  L. 103-182 623, 107 Stat. 2186, codified at 19 U.S.C.  1625(c), and took  effect after this case arose.3~    ~    ~      7~      Any of the 464 port-of-entry5 Customs offices may issue ruling letters,  and so may the Customs Headquarters Office, in providing \"[a]dvice or guidance  as to the interpretation or proper application of the Customs and related laws  with respect to a specific Customs transaction [which] may be requested by  Customs Service field offices ... at any time, whether the transaction is  prospective, current, or completed,\" 19 CFR  177.11(a) (2000). Most ruling  letters contain little or no reasoning, but simply describe goods and state the  appropriate category and tariff. A few letters, like the Headquarters ruling at  issue here, set out a rationale in some detail.~    ~    B~    ~      8~      Respondent, the Mead Corporation, imports \"day planners,\" three-ring binders  with pages having room for notes of daily schedules and phone numbers and  addresses, together with a calendar and suchlike. The tariff schedule on point  falls under the HTSUS heading for \"[r]egisters, account books, notebooks, order  books, receipt books, letter pads, memorandum pads, diaries and similar  articles,\" HTSUS subheading 4820.10, which comprises two subcategories. Items in  the first, \"[d]iaries, notebooks and address books, bound; memorandum pads,  letter pads and similar articles,\" were subject to a tariff of 4.0% at the time  in controversy. 185 F.3d 1304, 1305 (CA Fed. 1999) (citing subheading  4820.10.20); see also App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a. Objects in the second,  covering \"[o]ther\" items, were free of duty. HTSUS subheading 4820.10.40; see  also App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a.~    ~    ~      9~      Between 1989 and 1993, Customs repeatedly treated day planners under the  \"other\" HTSUS subheading. In January 1993, however, Customs changed its  position, and issued a Headquarters ruling letter classifying Mead's day  planners as \"Diaries ..., bound\" subject to tariff under subheading 4820.10.20.  That letter was short on explanation, App. to Brief in Opposition 4a-6a, but  after Mead's protest, Customs Headquarters issued a new letter, carefully  reasoned but never published, reaching the same conclusion, App. to Pet. for  Cert. 28a-47a. This letter considered two definitions of \"diary\" from the Oxford  English Dictionary, the first covering a daily journal of the past day's events,  the second a book including \" 'printed dates for daily memoranda and jottings;  also ... calendars ... .' \" Id., at 33a-34a (quoting Oxford English Dictionary 321  (Compact ed. 1982)). Customs concluded that \"diary\" was not confined to the  first, in part because the broader definition reflects commercial usage and  hence the \"commercial identity of these items in the marketplace.\" App. to Pet.  for Cert. 34a. As for the definition of \"bound,\" Customs concluded that HTSUS  was not referring to \"bookbinding,\" but to a less exact sort of fastening  described in the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory  Notes to Heading 4820, which spoke of binding by \" 'reinforcements or fittings  of metal, plastics, etc.' \" Id., at 45a.~    ~    ~      10~      Customs rejected Mead's further protest of the second Headquarters ruling  letter, and Mead filed suit in the Court of International Trade (CIT). The CIT  granted the Government's motion for summary judgment, adopting Customs's  reasoning without saying anything about deference. 17 F. Supp. 2d 1004 (1998).~    ~    ~      11~      Mead then went to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal  Circuit. While the case was pending there this Court decided United States v.  Haggar Apparel Co., 526 U.S. 380 (1999), holding that Customs regulations  receive the deference described in Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources  Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984). The appeals court requested briefing  on the impact of Haggar, and the Government argued that classification rulings, like  Customs regulations, deserve Chevron deference.~    ~    ~      12~      The Federal Circuit, however, reversed the CIT and held that Customs  classification rulings should not get Chevron deference, owing to differences  from the regulations at issue in Haggar. Rulings are not preceded by notice and  comment as under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C.  553 they \"do  not carry the force of law and are not, like regulations, intended to clarify  the rights and obligations of importers beyond the specific case under review.\"  185 F.3d, at 1307. The appeals court thought classification rulings had a weaker  Chevron claim even than Internal Revenue Service interpretive rulings, to which  that court gives no deference; unlike rulings by the IRS, Customs rulings issue  from many locations and need not be published. 185 F.3d, at 1307-1308.~    ~    ~      13~      The Court of Appeals accordingly gave no deference at all to the ruling  classifying the Mead day planners and rejected the agency's reasoning as to both  \"diary\" and \"bound.\" It thought that planners were not diaries because they had  no space for \"relatively extensive notations about events, observations,  feelings, or thoughts\" in the past. Id., at 1310. And it concluded that diaries  \"bound\" in subheading 4810.10.20 presupposed \"unbound\" diaries, such that  treating ring-fastened diaries as \"bound\" would leave the \"unbound diary\" an  empty category. Id., at 1311.~    ~    ~      14~      We granted certiorari, 530 U.S. 1202 (2000), in order to consider the limits  of Chevron deference owed to administrative practice in applying a statute. We  hold that administrative implementation of a particular statutory provision  qualifies for Chevron deference when it appears that Congress delegated  authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and  that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the  exercise of that authority. Delegation of such authority may be shown in a  variety of ways, as by an agency's power to engage in adjudication or  notice-and-comment rulemaking, or by some other indication of a comparable  congressional intent. The Customs ruling at issue here fails to qualify,  although the possibility that it deserves some deference under Skidmore leads us  to vacate and remand.~    ~    II~    ~      15~      * When Congress has \"explicitly left a gap for an agency to fill, there is an  express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision  of the statute by regulation,\" Chevron, 467 U.S., at 843-844, and any ensuing  regulation is binding in the courts unless procedurally defective, arbitrary or  capricious in substance, or manifestly contrary to the statute.6 See id., at  844; United States v. Morton, 467 U.S. 822, 834 (1984); APA, 5 U.S.C.   706(2)(A), (D). But whether or not they enjoy any express delegation of  authority on a particular question, agencies charged with applying a statute  necessarily make all sorts of interpretive choices, and while not all of those  choices bind judges to follow them, they certainly may influence courts facing  questions the agencies have already answered. \"[T]he well-reasoned views of the  agencies implementing a statute 'constitute a body of experience and informed  judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance,' \"  Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 642 (1998) (quoting Skidmore, 323 U.S., at  139-140), and \"[w]e have long recognized that considerable weight should be  accorded to an executive department's construction of a statutory scheme it is  entrusted to administer ... .\" Chevron, supra, at 844 (footnote omitted); see also  Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, 444 U.S. 555, 565 (1980); Zenith Radio Corp.  v. United States, 437 U.S. 443, 450 (1978). The fair measure of deference to an  agency administering its own statute has been understood to vary with  circumstances, and courts have looked to the degree of the agency's care,7 its  consistency,8 formality,9 and relative expertness,10 and to the persuasiveness  of the agency's position, see Skidmore, supra, at 139-140. The approach has  produced a spectrum of judicial responses, from great respect at one end, see,  e.g., Aluminum Co. of America v. Central Lincoln Peoples' Util. Dist., 467 U.S.  380, 389-390 (1984) (\" 'substantial deference' \" to administrative  construction), to near indifference at the other, see, e.g., Bowen v. Georgetown  Univ. Hospital, 488 U.S. 204, 212-213 (1988) (interpretation advanced for the  first time in a litigation brief). Justice Jackson summed things up in Skidmore  v. Swift  Co.:~    ~    ~      16~      \"The weight [accorded to an administrative] judgment in a particular case will  depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its  reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those  factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.\" 323 U.S.,  at 140.~    ~    ~      17~      Since 1984, we have identified a category of interpretive choices  distinguished by an additional reason for judicial deference. This Court in  Chevron recognized that Congress not only engages in express delegation of  specific interpretive authority, but that \"[s]ometimes the legislative  delegation to an agency on a particular question is implicit.\" 467 U.S., at 844.  Congress, that is, may not have expressly delegated authority or responsibility  to implement a particular provision or fill a particular gap. Yet it can still  be apparent from the agency's generally conferred authority and other statutory  circumstances that Congress would expect the agency to be able to speak with the  force of law when it addresses ambiguity in the statute or fills a space in the  enacted law, even one about which \"Congress did not actually have an intent\" as  to a particular result. Id., at 845. When circumstances implying such an  expectation exist, a reviewing court has no business rejecting an agency's  exercise of its generally conferred authority to resolve a particular statutory  ambiguity simply because the agency's chosen resolution seems unwise, see id.,  at 845-846, but is obliged to accept the agency's position if Congress has not  previously spoken to the point at issue and the agency's interpretation is  reasonable, see id., at 842-845; cf. 5 U.S.C.  706(2) (a reviewing court shall  set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be \"arbitrary,  capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law\").~    ~    ~      18~      We have recognized a very good indicator of delegation meriting Chevron  treatment in express congressional authorizations to engage in the process of  rulemaking or adjudication that produces regulations or rulings for which  deference is claimed. See, e.g., EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244,  257 (1991) (no Chevron deference to agency guideline where congressional  delegation did not include the power to \" 'promulgate rules or regulations' \"  (quoting General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125, 141) (1976)); see also  Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576, 596-597 (2000) (Breyer, J.,  dissenting) (where it is in doubt that Congress actually intended to delegate  particular interpretive authority to an agency, Chevron is \"inapplicable\"). It  is fair to assume generally that Congress contemplates administrative action  with the effect of law when it provides for a relatively formal administrative  procedure tending to foster the fairness and deliberation that should underlie a  pronouncement of such force.11 Cf. Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517  U.S. 735, 741 (1996) (APA notice and comment \"designed to assure due  deliberation\"). Thus, the overwhelming number of our cases applying Chevron  deference have reviewed the fruits of notice-and-comment rulemaking or formal  adjudication.12 That said, and as significant as notice-and-comment is in  pointing to Chevron authority, the want of that procedure here does not decide  the case, for we have sometimes found reasons for Chevron deference even when no  such administrative formality was required and none was afforded, see, e.g.,  NationsBank of N. C., N. A. v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., 513 U.S. 251,  256-257, 263 (1995).13 The fact that the tariff classification here was not a  product of such formal process does not alone, therefore, bar the application of  Chevron.~    ~    ~      19~      There are, nonetheless, ample reasons to deny Chevron deference here. The  authorization for classification rulings, and Customs's practice in making them,  present a case far removed not only from notice-and-comment process, but from  any other circumstances reasonably suggesting that Congress ever thought of  classification rulings as deserving the deference claimed for them here.~    ~    B~    ~      20~      No matter which angle we choose for viewing the Customs ruling letter in  this case, it fails to qualify under Chevron. On the face of the statute, to  begin with, the terms of the congressional delegation give no indication that  Congress meant to delegate authority to Customs to issue classification rulings  with the force of law. We are not, of course, here making any global statement  about Customs's authority, for it is true that the general rulemaking power  conferred on Customs, see 19 U.S.C.  1624 authorizes some regulation with the  force of law, or \"legal norms,\" as we put it in Haggar, 526 U.S., at 391.14 It  is true as well that Congress had classification rulings in mind when it  explicitly authorized, in a parenthetical, the issuance of \"regulations  establishing procedures for the issuance of binding rulings prior to the entry  of the merchandise concerned,\" 19 U.S.C.  1502(a).15 The reference to binding  classifications does not, however, bespeak the legislative type of activity that  would naturally bind more than the parties to the ruling, once the goods  classified are admitted into this country. And though the statute's direction to  disseminate \"information\" necessary to \"secure\" uniformity, 19 U.S.C.  1502(a),  seems to assume that a ruling may be precedent in later transactions,  precedential value alone does not add up to Chevron entitlement; interpretive  rules may sometimes function as precedents, see Strauss, The Rulemaking  Continuum, 41 Duke L. J. 1463, 1472-1473 (1992), and they enjoy no Chevron  status as a class. In any event, any precedential claim of a classification  ruling is counterbalanced by the provision for independent review of Customs  classifications by the CIT, see 28 U.S.C.  2638-2640; the scheme for CIT review  includes a provision that treats classification rulings on par with the  Secretary's rulings on \"valuation, rate of duty, marking, restricted  merchandise, entry requirements, drawbacks, vessel repairs, or similar matters,\"  1581(h); see 2639(b). It is hard to imagine a congressional understanding more  at odds with the Chevron regime.16~    ~    ~      21~      It is difficult, in fact, to see in the agency practice itself any  indication that Customs ever set out with a lawmaking pretense in mind when it  undertook to make classifications like these. Customs does not generally engage  in notice-and-comment practice when issuing them, and their treatment by the  agency makes it clear that a letter's binding character as a ruling stops short  of third parties; Customs has regarded a classification as conclusive only as  between itself and the importer to whom it was issued, 19 CFR  177.9(c) (2000),  and even then only until Customs has given advance notice of intended change,  177.9(a), (c). Other importers are in fact warned against assuming any right  of detrimental reliance. 177.9(c).~    ~    ~      22~      Indeed, to claim that classifications have legal force is to ignore the  reality that 46 different Customs offices issue 10,000 to 15,000 of them each  year, see Brief for Respondent 5; CITBA Brief 6 (citing Treasury Advisory  Committee on the Commercial Operations of the United States Customs Service,  Report of the COAC Subcommittee on ORR, Exhibits 1, 3 (Jan. 26, 2000)  (reprinted in App. to CITBA Brief 20a-21a)). Any suggestion that rulings  intended to have the force of law are being churned out at a rate of 10,000 a  year at an agency's 46 scattered offices is simply self-refuting. Although the  circumstances are less startling here, with a Headquarters letter in issue, none  of the relevant statutes recognizes this category of rulings as separate or  different from others; there is thus no indication that a more potent delegation  might have been understood as going to Headquarters even when Headquarters  provides developed reasoning, as it did in this instance.~    ~    ~      23~      Nor do the amendments to the statute made effective after this case arose  disturb our conclusion. The new law requires Customs to provide  notice-and-comment procedures only when modifying or revoking a prior  classification ruling or modifying the treatment accorded to substantially  identical transactions, 19 U.S.C.  1625(c); and under its regulations, Customs  sees itself obliged to provide notice-and-comment procedures only when \"changing  a practice\" so as to produce a tariff increase, or in the imposition of a  restriction or prohibition, or when Customs Headquarters determines that \"the  matter is of sufficient importance to involve the interests of domestic  industry,\" 19 CFR 177.10(c)(1)(2) (2000). The statutory changes reveal no new  congressional objective of treating classification decisions generally as  rulemaking with force of law, nor do they suggest any intent to create a Chevron  patchwork of classification rulings, some with force of law, some without.~    ~    ~      24~      In sum, classification rulings are best treated like \"interpretations  contained in policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines.\"  Christensen, 529 U.S., at 587. They are beyond the Chevron pale.~    ~    C~    ~      25~      To agree with the Court of Appeals that Customs ruling letters do not fall  within Chevron is not, however, to place them outside the pale of any deference  whatever. Chevron did nothing to eliminate Skidmore's holding that an agency's  interpretation may merit some deference whatever its form, given the  \"specialized experience and broader investigations and information\" available to  the agency, 323 U.S., at 139, and given the value of uniformity in its  administrative and judicial understandings of what a national law requires, id.,  at 140. See generally Metropolitan Stevedore Co. v. Rambo, 521 U.S., 121, 136  (1997) (reasonable agency interpretations carry \"at least some added persuasive  force\" where Chevron is inapplicable); Reno v. Koray, 515 U.S. 50, 61 (1995)  (according \"some deference\" to an interpretive rule that \"do[es] not require  notice and comment\"); Martin v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm'n,  499 U.S. 144, 157 (1991) (\"some weight\" is due to informal interpretations  though not \"the same deference as norms that derive from the exercise of ...  delegated lawmaking powers\").~    ~    ~      26~      There is room at least to raise a Skidmore claim here, where the regulatory  scheme is highly detailed, and Customs can bring the benefit of specialized  experience to bear on the subtle questions in this case: whether the daily  planner with room for brief daily entries falls under \"diaries,\" when diaries  are grouped with \"notebooks and address books, bound; memorandum pads, letter  pads and similar articles,\" HTSUS subheading 4820.10.20; and whether a planner  with a ring binding should qualify as \"bound,\" when a binding may be typified by  a book, but also may have \"reinforcements or fittings of metal, plastics, etc.,\"  Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes to Heading  4820, p. 687 (cited in Customs Headquarters letter, App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a.  A classification ruling in this situation may therefore at least seek a respect  proportional to its \"power to persuade,\" Skidmore, supra, at 140; see also  Christensen, 529 U.S., at 587; id., at 595 (Stevens, J., dissenting); id., at  596-597 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Such a ruling may surely claim the merit of  its writer's thoroughness, logic and expertness, its fit with prior  interpretations, and any other sources of weight.~    ~    D~    ~      27~      Underlying the position we take here, like the position expressed by Justice  Scalia in dissent, is a choice about the best way to deal with an inescapable  feature of the body of congressional legislation authorizing administrative  action. That feature is the great variety of ways in which the laws invest the  Government's administrative arms with discretion, and with procedures for  exercising it, in giving meaning to Acts of Congress. Implementation of a  statute may occur in formal adjudication or the choice to defend against  judicial challenge; it may occur in a central board or office or in dozens of  enforcement agencies dotted across the country; its institutional lawmaking may  be confined to the resolution of minute detail or extend to legislative  rulemaking on matters intentionally left by Congress to be worked out at the  agency level.~    ~    ~      28~      Although we all accept the position that the Judiciary should defer to at  least some of this multifarious administrative action, we have to decide how to  take account of the great range of its variety. If the primary objective is  to simplify the judicial process of giving or withholding deference, then the  diversity of statutes authorizing discretionary administrative action must be  declared irrelevant or minimized. If, on the other hand, it is simply  implausible that Congress intended such a broad range of statutory authority to  produce only two varieties of administrative action, demanding either Chevron  deference or none at all, then the breadth of the spectrum of possible agency  action must be taken into account. Justice Scalia's first priority over the  years has been to limit and simplify. The Court's choice has been to tailor  deference to variety.17 This acceptance of the range of statutory variation has  led the Court to recognize more than one variety of judicial deference, just as  the Court has recognized a variety of indicators that Congress would expect  Chevron deference.18~    ~    ~      29~      Our respective choices are repeated today. Justice Scalia would pose the  question of deference as an either-or choice. On his view that Chevron rendered  Skidmore anachronistic, when courts owe any deference it is Chevron deference  that they owe, post, at 9-10. Whether courts do owe deference in a given case  turns, for him, on whether the agency action (if reasonable) is \"authoritative,\"  post, at 17. The character of the authoritative derives, in turn, not from  breadth of delegation or the agency's procedure in implementing it, but is  defined as the \"official\" position of an agency, ibid., and may ultimately be a  function of administrative persistence alone, ibid.~    ~    ~      30~      The Court, on the other hand, said nothing in Chevron to eliminate  Skidmore's recognition of various justifications for deference depending on  statutory circumstances and agency action; Chevron was simply a case recognizing  that even without express authority to fill a specific statutory gap,  circumstances pointing to implicit congressional delegation present a  particularly insistent call for deference. Indeed, in holding here that Chevron  left Skidmore intact and applicable where statutory circumstances indicate no  intent to delegate general authority to make rules with force of law, or where  such authority was not invoked, we hold nothing more than we said last Term in  response to the particular statutory circumstances in Christensen, to which  Justice Scalia then took exception, see 529 U.S., at 589, just as he does again  today.~    ~    ~      31~      We think, in sum, that Justice Scalia's efforts to simplify ultimately run  afoul of Congress's indications that different statutes present different  reasons for considering respect for the exercise of administrative authority or  deference to it.

But Chevron itself is a good example showing when Chevron  deference is warranted, while this is a good case showing when it is not. Judges  in other, perhaps harder, cases will make reasoned choices between the two  examples, the way courts have always done.~      ~      ~        19~          Surely Justice Jackson's practical criteria, along with Chevron's concern  with congressional understanding, provide more reliable guideposts than  conclusory references to the \"authoritative\" or \"official.\" Even if those terms  provided a true criterion, there would have to be something wrong with a  standard that accorded the status of substantive law to every one of 10,000  \"official\" customs classifications rulings turned out each year from over 46  offices placed around the country at the Nation's entryways. Justice Scalia  tries to avoid that result by limiting what is \"authoritative\" or \"official\" to  a pronouncement that expresses the \"judgment of central agency management,  approved at the highest level,\" as distinct from the pronouncements of  \"underlings,\" post, at 22, n. 5. But that analysis would not entitle a  Headquarters ruling to Chevron deference; the \"highest level\" at Customs is the  source of the regulation at issue in Haggar, the Commissioner of Customs with  the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. 526 U.S., at 386. The  Commissioner did not issue the Headquarters ruling. What Justice Scalia has in  mind here is that because the Secretary approved the Government's position in  its brief to this Court, Chevron deference is due. But if that is so, Chevron  deference was not called for until sometime after the litigation began, when  central management at the highest level decided to defend the ruling, and the  deference is not to the classification ruling as such but to the brief. This  explains why the Court has not accepted Justice Scalia's position.~      ~    ~    ~      36~      Justice Scalia, dissenting.~    ~    ~      37~      Today's opinion makes an avulsive change in judicial review of federal  administrative action. Whereas previously a reasonable agency application of an  ambiguous statutory provision had to be sustained so long as it represented the  agency's authoritative interpretation, henceforth such an application can be set  aside unless \"it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency  generally to make rules carrying the force of law,\" as by giving an agency  \"power to engage in adjudication or notice-and-comment rulemaking, or ... some  other [procedure] indicati[ng] comparable congressional intent,\" and \"the agency  interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that  authority.\" Ante, at 6-7.1 What was previously a general presumption of  authority in agencies to resolve ambiguity in the statutes they have been  authorized to enforce has been changed to a presumption of no such authority,  which must be overcome by affirmative legislative intent to the contrary. And  whereas previously, when agency authority to resolve ambiguity did not exist the  court was free to give the statute what it considered the best interpretation,  henceforth the court must supposedly give the agency view some indeterminate  amount of so-called Skidmore deference. We will be sorting out the consequences  of the Mead doctrine, which has today replaced the Chevron doctrine, for years  to come. I would adhere to our established jurisprudence, defer to the  reasonable interpretation the Customs Service has given to the statute it is  charged with enforcing, and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.~    ~    ~      38~      * Only five years ago, the Court described the Chevron doctrine as follows:  \"We accord deference to agencies under Chevron ... because of a presumption that  Congress, when it left ambiguity in a statute meant for implementation by an  agency, understood that the ambiguity would be resolved, first and foremost, by  the agency, and desired the agency (rather than the courts) to possess whatever  degree of discretion the ambiguity allows,\" Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota),  N. A., 517 U.S. 735, 740-741 (1996) (citing Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v. Natural  Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843-844 (1984)). Today the Court  collapses this doctrine, announcing instead a presumption that agency discretion  does not exist unless the statute, expressly or impliedly, says so. While the  Court disclaims any hard-and-fast rule for determining the existence of  discretion-conferring intent, it asserts that \"a very good indicator [is]  express congressional authorizations to engage in the process of rulemaking or  adjudication that produces regulations or rulings for which deference is  claimed,\" ante, at 10. Only when agencies act through \"adjudication[,]  notice-and-comment rulemaking, or ... some other [procedure] indicati[ng]  comparable congressional intent [whatever that means]\" is Chevron deference  applicable-because these \"relatively formal administrative procedure[s]  [designed] to foster . . . fairness and deliberation\" bespeak (according to the  Court) congressional willingness to have the agency, rather than the courts,  resolve statutory ambiguities. Ante, at 7, 10. Once it is determined that  Chevron deference is not in order, the uncertainty is not at an end-and indeed  is just beginning. Litigants cannot then assume that the statutory question is  one for the courts to determine, according to traditional interpretive  principles and by their own judicial lights. No, the Court now resurrects, in  full force, the pre-Chevron doctrine of Skidmore deference, see Skidmore v.  Swift  Co., 323 U.S. 134 (1944), whereby \"[t]he fair measure of deference to an  agency administering its own statute ... var[ies] with circumstances,\" including  \"the degree of the agency's care, its consistency, formality, and relative  expertness, and ... the persuasiveness of the agency's position,\" ante, at 8  (footnotes omitted). The Court has largely replaced Chevron, in other words,  with that test most beloved by a court unwilling to be held to rules (and most  feared by litigants who want to know what to expect): th'ol' \"totality of the  circumstances\" test.~    ~    ~      39~      The Court's new doctrine is neither sound in principle nor sustainable in  practice.~    ~    ~      40~      * As to principle: The doctrine of Chevron-that all authoritative agency  interpretations of statutes they are charged with administering deserve  deference-was rooted in a legal presumption of congressional intent, important  to the division of powers between the Second and Third Branches. When, Chevron  said, Congress leaves an ambiguity in a statute that is to be administered by an  executive agency, it is presumed that Congress meant to give the agency  discretion, within the limits of reasonable interpretation, as to how the  ambiguity is to be resolved. By committing enforcement of the statute to an  agency rather than the courts, Congress committed its initial and primary  interpretation to that branch as well.~    ~    ~      41~      There is some question whether Chevron was faithful to the text of the  Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which it did not even bother to cite.2 But  it was in accord with the origins of federal-court judicial review. Judicial  control of federal executive officers was principally exercised through the  prerogative writ of mandamus. See L. Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative  Action 166, 176-177 (1965). That writ generally would not issue unless the  executive officer was acting plainly beyond the scope of his authority.~    ~    ~      42~      \"The questions mooted before the Secretary and decided by him were whether  the fund is a tribal fund, whether the tribe is still existing and whether the  distribution of the annuities is to be confined to members of the tribe ... .  These are all questions of law the solution of which requires a construction of  the act of 1889 and other related acts. A reading of these acts shows that they  fall short of plainly requiring that any of the questions be answered in the  negative and that in some aspects they give color to the affirmative answers of  the Secretary. That the construction of the acts insofar as they have a bearing  on the first and third questions is sufficiently uncertain to involve the  exercise of judgment and discretion is rather plain... .~    ~    ~      43~      . . . . .~    ~    ~      44~      \"From what has been said it follows that the case is not one in which  mandamus will lie.\" Wilbur v. United States ex rel. Kadrie, 281 U.S. 206,  221-222 (1930).~    ~    ~      45~      Statutory ambiguities, in other words, were left to reasonable resolution by the  Executive.~    ~    ~      46~      The basis in principle for today's new doctrine can be described as follows:  The background rule is that ambiguity in legislative instructions to agencies is  to be resolved not by the agencies but by the judges. Specific congressional  intent to depart from this rule must be found-and while there is no single  touchstone for such intent it can generally be found when Congress has  authorized the agency to act through (what the Court says is) relatively formal  procedures such as informal rulemaking and formal (and informal?) adjudication,  and when the agency in fact employs such procedures. The Court's background rule  is contradicted by the origins of judicial review of administrative action. But  in addition, the Court's principal criterion of congressional intent to supplant  its background rule seems to me quite implausible. There is no necessary  connection between the formality of procedure and the power of the entity  administering the procedure to resolve authoritatively questions of law. The  most formal of the procedures the Court refers to-formal adjudication-is modeled  after the process used in trial courts, which of course are not generally  accorded deference on questions of law. The purpose of such a procedure is to  produce a closed record for determination and review of the facts-which implies  nothing about the power of the agency subjected to the procedure to resolve  authoritatively questions of law.~    ~    ~      47~      As for informal rulemaking: While formal adjudication procedures are  prescribed (either by statute or by the Constitution), see 5 U.S.C.  554 556;  Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U.S. 33, 50 (1950), informal rulemaking is more  typically authorized but not required. Agencies with such authority are free to  give guidance through rulemaking, but they may proceed to administer their  statute case-by-case, \"making law\" as they implement their program (not  necessarily through formal adjudication). See NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416  U.S. 267, 290-295 (1974); SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 202-203 (1947). Is  it likely-or indeed even plausible-that Congress meant, when such an agency  chooses rulemaking, to accord the administrators of that agency, and their  successors, the flexibility of interpreting the ambiguous statute now one way,  and later another; but, when such an agency chooses case-by-case administration,  to eliminate all future agency discretion by having that same ambiguity resolved  authoritatively (and forever) by the courts?3 Surely that makes no sense. It is  also the case that certain significant categories of rules-those involving grant  and benefit programs, for example, are exempt from the requirements of informal  rulemaking. See 5 U.S.C.  553(a)(2). Under the Court's novel theory, when an  agency takes advantage of that exemption its rules will be deprived of Chevron  deference, i.e., authoritative effect. Was this either the plausible intent of  the APA rulemaking exemption, or the plausible intent of the Congress that  established the grant or benefit program?~    ~    ~      48~      Some decisions that are neither informal rulemaking nor formal adjudication  are required to be made personally by a Cabinet Secretary, without any  prescribed procedures. See e.g., United States v. Giordano, 416 U.S. 505, 508  (1974) (involving application of 18 U.S.C.  2516 (1970 ed.), requiring wiretap  applications to be authorized by \"[t]he Attorney General, or any Assistant  Attorney General specially designated by the Attorney General\"); D. C.  Federation of Civic Assns. v. Volpe, 459 F.2d 1231, 1248-1249 (CADC 1971)  (involving application of 23 U.S.C.  138 (1970 ed.) requiring the Secretary of  Transportation to determine that there is \"no feasible and prudent alternative  to the use of\" publicly owned parkland for a federally funded highway), cert.  denied, 405 U.S. 1030 (1972). Is it conceivable that decisions specifically  committed to these high-level officers are meant to be accorded no deference,  while decisions by an administrative law judge left in place without further  discretionary agency review, see 5 U.S.C.  557(b), are authoritative? This  seems to me quite absurd, and not at all in accord with any plausible actual  intent of Congress.~    ~    B~    ~      49~      As for the practical effects of the new rule:~    ~    ~      50~      (1)~    ~    ~      51~      The principal effect will be protracted confusion. As noted above, the one  test for Chevron deference that the Court enunciates is wonderfully imprecise:  whether \"Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules  carrying the force of law, ... as by ... adjudication[,] notice-and-comment  rulemaking, or ... some other [procedure] indicati[ng] comparable congressional  intent.\" But even this description does not do justice to the utter flabbiness  of the Court's criterion, since, in order to maintain the fiction that the new  test is really just the old one, applied consistently throughout our case law,  the Court must make a virtually open-ended exception to its already imprecise  guidance: In the present case, it tells us, the absence of notice-and-comment  rulemaking (and \"[who knows?] [of] some other [procedure] indicati[ng]  comparable congressional intent\") is not enough to decide the question of  Chevron deference, \"for we have sometimes found reasons for Chevron deference  even when no such administrative formality was required and none was afforded.\"  Ante, at 7, 11. The opinion then goes on to consider a grab bag of other  factors-including the factor that used to be the sole criterion for Chevron  deference: whether the interpretation represented the authoritative position of  the agency, see ante, at 13-15. It is hard to know what the lower courts are to make of today's guidance.~    ~    ~      52~      (2)~    ~    ~      53~      Another practical effect of today's opinion will be an artificially induced  increase in informal rulemaking. Buy stock in the GPO. Since informal rulemaking  and formal adjudication are the only more-or-less safe harbors from the storm  that the Court has unleashed; and since formal adjudication is not an option but  must be mandated by statute or constitutional command; informal rulemaking-which  the Court was once careful to make voluntary unless required by statute, see  Bell Aerospace, supra, and Chenery, supra-will now become a virtual necessity.  As I have described, the Court's safe harbor requires not merely that the agency  have been given rulemaking authority, but also that the agency have employed  rulemaking as the means of resolving the statutory ambiguity. (It is hard to  understand why that should be so. Surely the mere conferral of rulemaking  authority demonstrates-if one accepts the Court's logic-a congressional intent  to allow the agency to resolve ambiguities. And given that intent, what  difference does it make that the agency chooses instead to use another perfectly  permissible means for that purpose?) Moreover, the majority's approach will have  a perverse effect on the rules that do emerge, given the principle (which the  Court leaves untouched today) that judges must defer to reasonable agency  interpretations of their own regulations. See, e.g., United States v. Cleveland  Indians Baseball Co., 532 U.S. __ (2001) (slip op., at 18) (\"We need not decide  whether the [informal] Revenue Rulings themselves are entitled to deference[, ...  because] the Rulings simply reflect the agency's longstanding interpretation of  its own regulations\"). Agencies will now have high incentive to rush out  barebones, ambiguous rules construing statutory ambiguities, which they can then  in turn further clarify through informal rulings entitled to judicial respect.~    ~    ~      54~      (3)~    ~    ~      55~      Worst of all, the majority's approach will lead to the ossification of large  portions of our statutory law. Where Chevron applies, statutory ambiguities  remain ambiguities subject to the agency's ongoing clarification. They create a  space, so to speak, for the exercise of continuing agency discretion. As Chevron  itself held, the Environmental Protection Agency can interpret \"stationary  source\" to mean a single smokestack, can later replace that interpretation with  the \"bubble concept\" embracing an entire plant, and if that proves undesirable  can return again to the original interpretation. 467 U.S., at 853-859, 865-866.  For the indeterminately large number of statutes taken out of Chevron by today's  decision, however, ambiguity (and hence flexibility) will cease with the first  judicial resolution. Skidmore deference gives the agency's current position some  vague and uncertain amount of respect, but it does not, like Chevron, leave the  matter within the control of the Executive Branch for the future. Once the court  has spoken, it becomes unlawful for the agency to take a contradictory position;  the statute now says what the court has prescribed. See Neal v. United States,  516 U.S. 284, 295 (1996); Lechmere, Inc. v. NLRB, 502 U.S. 527, 536-537 (1992);  Maislin Industries, U.S., Inc. v. Primary Steel, Inc., 497 U.S. 116, 131 (1990).  It will be bad enough when this ossification occurs as a result of judicial  determination (under today's new principles) that there is no affirmative  indication of congressional intent to \"delegate\"; but it will be positively  bizarre when it occurs simply because of an agency's failure to act by  rulemaking (rather than informal adjudication) before the issue is presented to  the courts.~    ~    ~      56~      One might respond that such ossification would not result if the agency were  simply to readopt its interpretation, after a court reviewing it under Skidmore  had rejected it, by repromulgating it through one of the Chevron-eligible  procedural formats approved by the Court today. Approving this procedure would  be a landmark abdication of judicial power. It is worlds apart from Chevron  proper, where the court does not purport to give the statute a judicial  interpretation-except in identifying the scope of the statutory ambiguity, as to  which the court's judgment is final and irreversible. (Under Chevron proper,  when the agency's authoritative interpretation comes within the scope of that  ambiguity-and the court therefore approves it-the agency will not be  \"overruling\" the court's decision when it later decides that a different  interpretation (still within the scope of the ambiguity) is preferable.) By  contrast, under this view, the reviewing court will not be holding the agency's  authoritative interpretation within the scope of the ambiguity; but will be  holding that the agency has not used the \"delegation-conferring\" procedures, and  that the court must therefore interpret the statute on its own-but subject to  reversal if and when the agency uses the proper procedures.~    ~    ~      57~      One is reminded of Justice Jackson's words in Chicago  Southern Air Lines,  Inc. v. Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 113 (1948):~    ~    ~      58~      \"The court below considered that after it reviewed the Board's order its  judgment would be submitted to the President, that his power to disapprove would  apply after as well as before the court acts, and hence that there would be no  chance of a deadlock and no conflict of function. But if the President may  completely disregard the judgment of the court, it would be only because it is  one the courts were not authorized to render. Judgments within the powers vested  in courts by the Judiciary Article of the Constitution may not lawfully be revised, overturned or refused faith and credit by another Department of Government.\"~    ~    ~      59~      I know of no case, in the entire history of the federal courts, in which we have  allowed a judicial interpretation of a statute to be set aside by an agency-or  have allowed a lower court to render an interpretation of a statute subject to  correction by an agency. As recently as 1996, we rejected an attempt to do  precisely that. In Chapman v. United States, 500 U.S. 453 (1991), we had held  that the weight of the blotter paper bearing the lysergic acid diethylamide  (LSD) must be counted for purposes of determining whether the quantity crossed  the 10-gram threshold of 21 U.S.C.  841(b)(1)(A)(v) imposing a minimum sentence  of 10 years. At that time the United States Sentencing Commission applied a  similar approach under the Sentencing Guidelines, but had taken no position  regarding the meaning of the statutory provision. The Commission later changed  its Guidelines approach, and, according to the petitioner in Neal v. United  States, 516 U.S. 284 (1996), made clear its view that the statute bore that  meaning as well. The petitioner argued that we should defer to that new  approach. We would have none of it.~    ~    ~      60~      \"Were we, for argument's sake, to adopt petitioner's view that the  Commission intended the commentary as an interpretation of 841(b)(1), and that  the last sentence of the commentary states the Commission's view that the  dose-based method is consistent with the term 'mixture or substance' in the  statute, he still would not prevail. The Commission's dose-based method cannot  be squared with Chapman... . In these circumstances, we need not decide what, if  any, deference is owed the Commission in order to reject its alleged contrary  interpretation. Once we have determined a statute's meaning, we adhere to our  ruling under the doctrine of stare decisis, and we assess an agency's later  interpretation of the statute against that settled law.\" Id., at 294-295  (citations omitted).~    ~    ~      61~      There is, in short, no way to avoid the ossification of federal law that today's  opinion sets in motion. What a court says is the law after according Skidmore  deference will be the law forever, beyond the power of the agency to change even  through rulemaking.~    ~    ~      62~      (4)~    ~    ~      63~      And finally, the majority's approach compounds the confusion it creates by  breathing new life into the anachronism of Skidmore, which sets forth a sliding  scale of deference owed an agency's interpretation of a statute that is  dependent \"upon the thoroughness evident in [the agency's] consideration, the  validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later  pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if  lacking power to control\"; in this way, the appropriate measure of deference  will be accorded the \"body of experience and informed judgment\" that such  interpretations often embody, 323 U.S., at 140. Justice Jackson's eloquence  notwithstanding, the rule of Skidmore deference is an empty truism and a  trifling statement of the obvious: A judge should take into account the  well-considered views of expert observers.~    ~    ~      64~      It was possible to live with the indeterminacy of Skidmore deference in  earlier times. But in an era when federal statutory law administered by federal  agencies is pervasive, and when the ambiguities (intended or unintended) that  those statutes contain are innumerable, totality-of-the-circumstances Skidmore  deference is a recipe for uncertainty, unpredictability, and endless litigation.  To condemn a vast body of agency action to that regime (all except rulemaking,  formal (and informal?) adjudication, and whatever else might now and then be included within today's intentionally vague formulation of affirmative congressional intent to \"delegate\") is irresponsible.~    ~    II~    ~      65~      The Court's pretense that today's opinion is nothing more than application  of our prior case law does not withstand analysis. It is, to be sure, impossible  to demonstrate that any of our cases contradicts the rule of decision that the  Court prescribes, because the Court prescribes none. More precisely, it at one  and the same time (1) renders meaningless its newly announced requirement that  there be an affirmative congressional intent to have ambiguities resolved by the  administering agency, and (2) ensures that no prior decision can possibly be  cited which contradicts that requirement, by simply announcing that all prior  decisions according Chevron deference exemplify the multifarious ways in which  that congressional intent can be manifested: \"[A]s significant as  notice-and-comment is in pointing to Chevron authority, the want of that  procedure here does not decide the case, for we have sometimes found reasons for  Chevron deference even when no such administrative formality was required and  none was afforded,\" ante, at 10-11.4~    ~    ~      66~      The principles central to today's opinion have no antecedent in our  jurisprudence. Chevron, the case that the opinion purportedly explicates, made  no mention of the \"relatively formal administrative procedure[s],\" ante, at 10,  that the Court today finds the best indication of an affirmative intent by  Congress to have ambiguities resolved by the administering agency. Which is not  so remarkable, since Chevron made no mention of any need to find such an  affirmative intent; it said that in the event of statutory ambiguity agency  authority to clarify was to be presumed. And our cases have followed that  prescription.~    ~    ~      67~      Six years ago, we unanimously accorded Chevron deference to an  interpretation of the National Bank Act, 12 U.S.C.  24 Seventh (1988 ed. and  Supp. V), contained in a letter to a private party from a Senior Deputy  Comptroller of the Currency. See NationsBank of N. C., N. A. v. Variable Annuity  Life Ins. Co., 513 U.S. 251, 255, 257 (1995). We did so because the letter  represented (and no one contested) that it set forth the official position of  the Comptroller of the Currency, see id., at 263.~    ~    ~      68~      Several cases decided virtually in the wake of Chevron, which the Court  conveniently ignores, demonstrate that Congress could not (if it was reading our  opinions) have acted in reliance on a background assumption that Chevron  deference would generally be accorded only to agency interpretations arrived at  through formal adjudication, notice-and-comment rulemaking, or other procedures  assuring \"fairness and deliberation,\" ante, at 10. In FDIC v. Philadelphia Gear  Corp., 476 U.S. 426, 438-439 (1986), we accorded Chevron deference to the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's interpretation of the statutory term  \"deposit\" reflected in a course of unstructured administrative actions, and gave  particular weight to the agency's \"contemporaneous understanding\" reflected in  the response given by an FDIC official to a question asked at a meeting of FDIC  and bank officials. It was clear that the position reflected the official  position of the agency, and that was enough to command Chevron deference. In  Young v. Community Nutrition Institute, 476 U.S. 974 (1986), the statutory  ambiguity at issue pertained to a provision that \"the Secretary [of Health and  Human Services] shall promulgate regulations limiting the quantity [of any  poisonous or deleterious substance added to any food] to such extent as he finds  necessary for the protection of public health.\" The Secretary had regularly  interpreted the phrase \"to such extent as he finds necessary\" as conferring  discretion not to issue a rule, rather than merely discretion regarding the  quantity that the rule would permit. This interpretation was not, of course,  reflected in any formal adjudication, and had not been the subject of any  informal rulemaking-it was the Secretary's understanding consistently applied in  the course of the Department's practice. We accorded it Chevron deference, as  unquestionably we should have. And in Mead Corp. v. Tilley, 490 U.S. 714 (1989),  a private suit by retirees against their former employer under the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), we accorded Chevron deference to  the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's interpretation of 4044(a) of the  Act, 29 U.S.C.  1344(a) (1982 ed. and Supp. V), that was reflected only in an  amicus brief to this Court and in several Opinion Letters issued without benefit  of any prescribed procedures. See 490 U.S., at 722.~    ~    ~      69~      I could continue to enumerate cases according Chevron deference to agency  interpretations not arrived at through formal proceedings-for example, Pension  Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U.S. 633, 642-643, 647-648 (1990)  (according Chevron deference to the PBGC's interpretation of the requirements  for its restoring a terminated plan under 4047 of ERISA, 29 U.S.C.  1347 (1988  ed.), which interpretation was reflected in nothing more than the agency's act  of issuing a notice of restoration). Suffice it to say that many cases flatly  contradict the theory of Chevron set forth in today's opinion, and with one  exception not a single case can be found with language that supports the theory.  That exception, a very recent one, deserves extended discussion.~    ~    ~      70~      In Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576 (2000), the Court said the  following:~    ~    ~      71~      \"[W]e confront an interpretation contained in an opinion letter, not one  arrived at after, for example, a formal adjudication or notice-and-comment  rulemaking. Interpretations such as those in opinion letters-like  interpretations contained in policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement  guidelines, all of which lack the force of law-do not warrant Chevron-style  deference.\" Id., at 587.~    ~    ~      72~      This statement was dictum, unnecessary to the Court's holding. Since the Court  went on to find that the Secretary of Labor's position \"ma[de] little sense\"  given the text and structure of the statute, id., at 585-586, Chevron deference  could not have been accorded no matter what the conditions for its application.  See 529 U.S., at 591 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in  judgment). It was, moreover, dictum unsupported by the precedent that the Court  cited.~    ~    ~      73~      The Christensen majority followed its above-quoted dictum with a string  citation of three cases, none of which sustains its point. In Reno v. Koray, 515  U.S. 50 (1995), we had no occasion to consider what level of deference was owed  the Bureau of Prisons' interpretation of 18 U.S.C.  3585(b) set forth in an  internal agency guideline, because our opinion made clear that we would have  independently arrived at the same interpretation on our own, see 515 U.S., at  57-60. And although part of one sentence in Koray might be read to suggest that  the Bureau's \"Program Statemen[t]\" should be accorded a measure of deference  less than that mandated by Chevron, this aside is ultimately inconclusive, since  the sentence ends by observing that the Statement was \"a 'permissible  construction of the statute' \" under Chevron, 515 U.S., at 61 (quoting Chevron,  467 U.S., at 843). In the second case cited, EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co.,  499 U.S. 244 (1991), it was again unnecessary to our holding whether the  agency's interpretation of the statute warranted Chevron deference, since the  \"longstanding ... 'canon of [statutory] construction' \" disfavoring  extraterritoriality, 499 U.S., at 248, would have required the same result even  if Chevron applied. See 499 U.S., at 260 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and  concurring in judgment). While the opinion did purport to accord the Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission's informally promulgated interpretation only  Skidmore deference, it did so because the Court thought itself bound by its  pre-Chevron, EEOC-specific decision in General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U.S.  125 (1976), which noted that \" 'Congress, in enacting Title VII, did not' \"  intend to give the EEOC substantive authority to resolve statutory ambiguities,  Arabian American Oil, supra, at 257 (quoting Gilbert, supra, at 141). Lastly, in  Martin v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm'n, 499 U.S. 144 (1991), the  question of the level of deference owed the Secretary of Labor's interpretation  of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 1590, as amended, 29  U.S.C.  651 et seq., was neither presented by the case nor considered in our  opinion. The only question before the Court was which of two competing  interpretations of 29 CFR  1910.1029 (1990)-the Secretary's or the Occupational  Safety and Health Review Commission's-should have been deferred to by the court  below. See 499 U.S., at 150. The dicta the Christensen Court cited, 529 U.S., at  587 (citing 499 U.S., at 157), opined on the measure of deference owed the  Secretary's interpretation, not of the statute, but of his own regulations, see  generally Manning, Constitutional Structure and Judicial Deference to Agency  Interpretations of Agency Rules, 96 Colum. L. Rev. 612 (1996).~    ~    ~      74~      To make matters worse, the arguments marshaled by Christensen in support of  its dictum-its observation that \"interpretations contained in policy statements,  agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines, all ... lack the force of law,\" and  its citation of 1 K. Davis  R. Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise 3.5 (3d ed.  1994), 529 U.S., at 587-are not only unpersuasive but bear scant resemblance to  the reasoning of today's opinion. Davis and Pierce, and Professor Robert Anthony  upon whom they rely, see Anthony, Which Agency Interpretations Should Bind  Citizens and the Courts?, 7 Yale J. on Reg. 1 (1990), do indeed set forth the  argument I have criticized above, that congressional authorization of informal  rulemaking or formal (and perhaps even informal) adjudication somehow bespeaks a  congressional intent to \"delegate\" power to resolve statutory ambiguities. But  their analysis does not permit the broad add-ons that the Court's opinion  contains-\"some other [procedure] indicati[ng] comparable congressional intent,\"  ante, at 7, and \"we have sometimes found reasons for Chevron deference even when  no such administrative formality was required and none was afforded,\" ante, at  11.~    ~    III~    ~      75~      To decide the present case, I would adhere to the original formulation of  Chevron. \" ' The power of an administrative agency to administer a  congressionally created ... program necessarily requires the formulation of policy  and the making of rules to fill any gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress,' \" 467 U.S., at 843 (quoting Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U.S.  199, 231 (1974)). We accordingly presume-and our precedents have made clear to  Congress that we presume-that, absent some clear textual indication to the  contrary, \"Congress, when it left ambiguity in a statute meant for  implementation by an agency, understood that the ambiguity would be resolved,  first and foremost, by the agency, and desired the agency (rather than the  courts) to possess whatever degree of discretion the ambiguity allows,\" Smiley,  517 U.S., at 740-741 (citing Chevron, supra, at 843-844). Chevron sets forth an  across-the-board presumption, which operates as a background rule of law against  which Congress legislates: Ambiguity means Congress intended agency discretion.  Any resolution of the ambiguity by the administering agency that is  authoritative-that represents the official position of the agency-must be  accepted by the courts if it is reasonable.~    ~    ~      76~      Nothing in the statute at issue here displays an intent to modify the  background presumption on which Chevron deference is based. The Court points,  ante, at 13, n. 16, to 28 U.S.C.  2640(a), which provides that, in reviewing  the ruling by the Customs Service, the Court of International Trade (CIT) \"shall  make its determinations upon the basis of the record made before the court.\" But  records are made to determine the facts, not the law. All this provision means  is that new evidence may be introduced at the CIT stage; it says nothing about  whether the CIT must respect the Customs Service's authoritative interpretation  of the law. More significant than 2640(a), insofar as the CIT's obligation to  defer to the Customs Service's legal interpretations is concerned, is  2639(a)(1), which requires the CIT to accord a \"presum[ption of] correct[ness]\"  to the Customs Service's decision. Another provision cited by the Court, ante,  at 13, n. 16, is 2638, which provides that the CIT \"by rule, may consider any  new ground in support\" of the challenge to the Customs Service's ruling. Once  again, it is impossible to see how this has any connection to the degree of  deference the CIT must accord the Customs Service's interpretation of its  statute. Such \"new ground[s]\" may be intervening or newly discovered facts, or  some intervening law or regulation that might render the Customs Service's  ruling unsound.5~    ~    ~      77~      There is no doubt that the Customs Service's interpretation represents the  authoritative view of the agency. Although the actual ruling letter was signed  by only the Director of the Commercial Rulings Branch of Customs Headquarters'  Office of Regulations and Rulings, see Pet. for Cert. 47a, the Solicitor General  of the United States has filed a brief, cosigned by the General Counsel of the  Department of the Treasury, that represents the position set forth in the ruling  letter to be the official position of the Customs Service. Cf. Christensen, 529  U.S., at 591 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). No one  contends that it is merely a \"post hoc rationalizatio[n]\" or an \"agency  litigating positio[n] wholly unsupported by regulations, rulings, or  administrative practice,\" Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U.S. 204, 212  (1988).6~    ~    ~      78~      There is also no doubt that the Customs Service's interpretation is a  reasonable one, whether or not judges would consider it the best. I will not  belabor this point, since the Court evidently agrees: An interpretation that was  unreasonable would not merit the remand that the Court decrees for consideration  of Skidmore deference.~    ~    IV~    ~      79~      Finally, and least importantly, even were I to accept the Court's revised  version of Chevron as a correct statement of the law, I would still accord  deference to the tariff classification ruling at issue in this case. For the  case is indistinguishable, in that regard, from NationsBank of N. C., N. A. v.  Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., 513 U.S. 251 (1995), which the Court  acknowledges as an instance in which Chevron deference is warranted  notwithstanding the absence of formal adjudication, notice-and-comment  rulemaking, or comparable \"administrative formality,\" ante, at 11. Here, as in  NationsBank, there is a tradition of great deference to the opinions of the  agency head, ante, at 11, n. 13. Just two Terms ago, we observed: \"As early as 1809, Chief Justice Marshall noted in a customs case that '[i]f the  question had been doubtful, the court would have respected the uniform  construction which it is understood has been given by the treasury department of  the United States upon similar questions.' United States v. Vowell, 5 Cranch  368, 372. See also P. Reed, The Role of Federal Courts in U.S. Customs   International Trade Law 289 (1997) ('Consistent with the Chevron methodology,  and as has long been the rule in customs cases, customs regulations are  sustained if they represent reasonable interpretations of the statute'); cf.  Zenith Radio Corp. v. United States, 437 U.S. 443, 450 (1978) (deferring to the  Treasury Department's 'longstanding and consistent administrative  interpretation' of the countervailing duty provision of the Tariff Act.\" United  States v. Haggar Apparel Co., 526 U.S. 380, 393 (1999).~    ~    ~      80~      And here, as in NationsBank, the agency interpretation in question is officially  that of the agency head. Con-sequently, even on the Court's own terms, the  Customs ruling at issue in this case should be given Chevron deference.~    ~    ~      81~      * * *~    ~    ~      82~      For the reasons stated, I respectfully dissent from the Court's judgment. I  would uphold the Customs Service's construction of Subheading 4820.10.20 of the  Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, 19 U.S.C.  1202 and would  reverse the contrary decision of the Court of Appeals. I dissent even more  vigorously from the reasoning that produces the Court's judgment, and that makes  today's decision one of the most significant opinions ever rendered by the Court  dealing with the judicial review of administrative action. Its consequences will  be enormous, and almost uniformly bad.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~          It is not entirely clear whether the formulation newly minted by the Court  today extends to both formal and informal adjudication, or simply the former.  Cf., e.g., ante, at 10.~      ~      ~        2~          Title 5 U.S.C.  706 provides that, in reviewing agency action, the court  shall \"decide all relevant questions of law\"-which would seem to mean that all  statutory ambiguities are to be resolved judicially. See Anthony, The Supreme  Court and the APA: Sometimes They Just Don't Get It, 10 Admin. L. J. Am. U. 1,  9-11 (1996). It could be argued, however, that the legal presumption identified  by Chevron left as the only \"questio[n] of law\" whether the agency's  interpretation had gone beyond the scope of discretion that the statutory  ambiguity conferred. Today's opinion, of course, is no more observant of the  APA's text than Chevron was-and indeed is even more difficult to reconcile with  it. Since the opinion relies upon actual congressional intent to suspend 706,  rather than upon a legal presumption against which 706 was presumably enacted,  it runs head-on into the provision of the APA which specifies that the Act's  requirements (including the requirement that judges shall \"decide all relevant  questions of law\") cannot be amended except expressly. See 559.~      ~      ~        3~          See infra, at 9-12.~      ~      ~        4~          As a sole, teasing example of those \"sometimes\" the Court cites NationsBank  of N. C., N. A. v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., 513 U.S. 251 (1995),  explaining in a footnote that our \"longstanding precedent\" evinced a tradition  of great deference to the \" 'deliberative conclusions' \" of the Comptroller of  the Currency as to the meaning of the banking laws the Comptroller is charged  with enforcing. Ante, at 11, n. 13. How it is that a tradition of great judicial  deference to the agency head provides affirmative indication of congressional  intent to delegate authority to resolve statutory ambiguities challenges the  intellect and the imagination. If the point is that Congress must have been  aware of that tradition of great deference when it enacted the law at issue, the  same could be said of the Customs Service, and indeed of all agencies. See,  e.g., 4 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise 30.08, pp. 237-238 (1958)  (describing the \"great weight\" accorded the \"determination[s]\" of the Federal  Trade Commission (quoting FTC v. Cement Institute, 333 U.S. 683, 720 (1948));  Report of the Attorney General's Committee on Administrative Procedure, S. Doc.  No. 8, 77th Cong., 1st Sess., 90-91 (1941). Indeed, since our opinion in Chevron  Congress must have been aware that we would defer to all authoritative agency  resolutions of statutory ambiguities. Needless to say, NationsBank itself makes  no mention of any such affirmative indication, because it was never the law. The  many other cases that contradict the Court's new rule will presumably be  explained, like NationsBank, as other \"modes\" of displaying affirmative  congressional intent. If a tradition of judicial deference can be called that  with a straight face, what cannot be?~      ~      ~        5~          The Court also states that \"[i]t is hard to imagine\" that Congress would  have intended courts to defer to classification rulings since \"the scheme for  CIT review includes a provision that treats classification rulings on par with  the Secretary's rulings on 'valuation, rate of duty, marking, restricted  merchandise, entry requirements, drawbacks, vessel repairs, or similar matters,'  \" ante, at 13 (quoting 28 U.S.C.  1581(h), and citing 2639(b)). I fail to see  why this is hard to imagine at all. If anything, the fact that \"the scheme for  CIT review ... treats classification rulings on par with the Secretary's rulings  on\" such important matters as \" 'valuation, rate of duty, ... restricted  merchandise [and] entry requirements,' \" ante, at 13, which often require  interpretation of the Nation's customs and tariff statutes, only strengthens the  case for according Chevron deference to whatever statutory interpretations (as  opposed to factual determinations) such rulings embody. In other words, the  Court's point is wrong-indeed, the Court's point cuts deeply into its own  case-unless the Court believes that the Secretary's personal rulings on the  legal criteria for imposing particular rates of duty, or for determining  restricted merchandise, are entitled to no deference.~      ~      ~        6~          The Court's parting shot, that \"there would have to be something wrong with  a standard that accorded the status of substantive law to every one of 10,000  'official' customs classifications rulings turned out each year from over 46  offices placed around the country at the Nation's entryways,\" ante, at 19, n.  19, misses the mark. I do not disagree. The \"authoritativeness\" of an agency  interpretation does not turn upon whether it has been enunciated by someone who  is actually employed by the agency. It must represent the judgment of central  agency management, approved at the highest levels. I would find that condition  to have been satisfied when, a ruling having been attacked in court, the general  counsel of the agency has determined that it should be defended. If one thinks  that that does not impart sufficient authoritativeness, then surely the line has  been crossed when, as here, the General Counsel of the agency and the Solicitor  General of the United States have assured this Court that the position  represents the agency's authoritative view. (Contrary to the Court's suggestion,  there would be nothing bizarre about the fact that this latter approach would  entitle the ruling to deference here, though it would not have been entitled to  deference in the lower courts. Affirmation of the official agency position  before this court-if that is thought necessary-is no different from the agency's  issuing a new rule after the Court of Appeals determination. It establishes a  new legal basis for the decision, which this Court must take into account (or  remand for that purpose), even though the Court of Appeals could not. See Thorpe  v. Housing Authority of Durham, 393 U.S. 268, 282 (1969); see also United States  v. Schooner Peggy, 1 Cranch 103 (1801).)     The authoritativeness of the agency  ruling may not be a bright-line standard-but it is infinitely brighter than the  line the Court asks us to draw today, between a statute such as the one at issue  in NationsBank that (according to the Court) does display an \"affirmative  intent\" to \"delegate\" interpretive authority, and innumerable indistinguishable  statutes that (according to the Court) do not. And, most important of all, it is  a line that focuses attention on the right question: not whether Congress  \"affirmatively intended\" to delegate interpretive authority (if it entrusted  administration of the statute to an agency, it did, because that is how our  system works); but whether it is truly the agency's considered view, or just the  opinions of some underlings, that are at issue.~      ~    ~    ",

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.IDAHO, PETITIONERv.UNITED STATES et al.~    No. 00-189.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued April 23, 2001Decided June 18, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      This suit involves a dispute between the United States and Idaho over the ownership of submerged lands underlying portions of Lake Coeur d'Alene and the St. Joe River. The Coeur d'Alene Tribe once inhabited vast acreage in and about what is now Idaho, and traditionally used Lake Coeur d'Alene and the St. Joe River for food, fiber, transportation, recreation, and cultural activities. In 1873, the Tribe agreed to relinquish for compensation all claims to its aboriginal lands outside the bounds of a specified reservation that included part of the river and virtually all of the lake. The agreement required congressional approval, but President Grant set the land aside in an 1873 Executive Order, which set the reservation's northern boundary directly across the lake. An 1883 Government survey indicated that the reservation included submerged lands. When Congress neither ratified the agreement nor compensated the Tribe, the Tribe petitioned the Government to make a proper treaty and Congress authorized negotiations. In 1887, the Tribe agreed to cede its rights to all land except that within the Executive Order reservation, and the Government promised to compensate the Tribe and agreed to hold the land forever as Indian land. Still, Congress did not ratify the agreement. In 1888, the Interior Secretary responded to a Senate enquiry about the reservation's boundaries, reporting that the reservation appeared to embrace all but a small fragment of the lake's navigable waters and that the St. Joe River flowed through the reservation. Also in 1888, Congress approved a railroad right-of-way that crossed the reservation's navigable waters, but directed that the Tribe's consent be obtained and that the Tribe be compensated. Responding to a growing desire to obtain for the public an interest in portions of the reservation, Congress authorized negotiations that produced a new agreement in 1889, in which the Tribe agreed to cede the reservation's northern portion, including two-thirds of the lake, for compensation. In 1890, the Senate passed a bill ratifying the 1887 and 1889 agreements, but while the bill was pending in the House, Congress passed the Idaho Statehood Act, admitting Idaho to the Union. In 1891, Congress ratified the 1887 and 1889 agreements. The United States initiated this action against Idaho to quiet title in the United States, in trust for the Tribe, to the submerged lands within the current reservation. The Tribe intervened to assert its interest in those lands, and Idaho counterclaimed to quiet title in its favor. The District Court quieted title in the United States as trustee, and the Tribe as beneficiary, to the bed and banks of the lake and the river within the reservation. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.~      Held: The National Government holds title, in trust for the Tribe, to lands underlying portions of Lake Coeur d'Alene and the St. Joe River. Pp. 9-18.~      (a) Armed with the strong presumption against defeat of a State's title to land under navigable waters, United States v. Alaska, 521 U.S. 1, 34, the Court looks to Congress's declarations and intent when resolving conflicts over submerged lands claimed to be reserved or conveyed by the United States before statehood, e.g., id., at 36. The two-step enquiry used in reservation cases asks whether Congress intended to include submerged lands within the federal reservation, and, if so, whether Congress intended to defeat the future State's title to those lands. Ibid. Where, as here, the Executive Branch initially reserved the land, the two-step test is satisfied when an Executive reservation clearly includes submerged lands, and Congress recognizes that reservation in a way that demonstrates its intent to defeat state title. Id., at 41-46, 55-61. Here, Idaho has conceded that the Executive Branch intended, or interpreted, the 1873 Executive Order reservation to include submerged lands. Pp. 9-11.~      (b) Congress recognized the full extent of the Executive Order reservation and it intended to bar passage to Idaho of title to the submerged lands at issue. Idaho's concession, in the Ninth Circuit, that the Executive Order reservation included submerged lands and that Congress was on notice regarding the scope of the reservation was prudent in light of the District Court's findings of facts. That court concluded that the submerged lands and related water rights had been continuously important to the Tribe throughout the period prior to congressional action confirming the reservation and granting Idaho statehood, and that the Federal Government could only achieve its goals of promoting settlement in the Tribe's aboriginal area, avoiding hostilities with the Tribe, and extinguishing aboriginal title by agreeing to a reservation that included the submerged lands. That is the background of the 1873 Executive Order's inclusion of such lands, which in turn were the subject of the Senate's 1888 request to the Interior Secretary, whose response was consistent with the 1883 survey results. The manner in which Congress then proceeded to deal with the Tribe shows clearly that preservation of the reservation's land, absent contrary agreement with the Tribe, was central to Congress's complementary objectives of dealing with pressures of white settlement and establishing the reservation by permanent legislation. Congress made it expressly plain that its object was to obtain tribal interests only by tribal consent. When it sought to extinguish aboriginal title to lands outside the 1873 reservation and to reduce the reservation's size, it did so by authorizing negotiations with the Tribe to cede title for compensation. It also honored the reservation's boundaries by requiring that the Tribe be compensated for the railroad right-of-way. The intent was that anything not consensually ceded by the Tribe would remain for the Tribe's benefit, an objective flatly at odds with Idaho's view that Congress meant to transfer the balance of submerged lands to the State in what would have amounted to an act of bad faith accomplished by unspoken operation of law. Idaho's position is also at odds with later manifestations of congressional understanding that statehood had not affected the submerged lands. Pp. 11-17.~      210 F.3d 1067, affirmed.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT~      Souter, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Stevens, O'Connor, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      The United States brought this quiet title action against the State of Idaho. The question is whether the National Government holds title, in trust for the Coeur d'Alene Tribe, to lands underlying portions of Lake Coeur d'Alene and the St. Joe River. We hold that it does.~    ~    ~      2~      * The Coeur d'Alene Tribe once inhabited more than 3.5 million acres in what is now northern Idaho and northeastern Washington, including the area of Lake Coeur d'Alene and the St. Joe River. 95 F. Supp. 2d 1094, 1095-1096, 1099-1100 (Idaho 1998).1 Tribal members traditionally used the lake and its related waterways for food, fiber, transportation, recreation, and cultural activities. Id., at 1099-1102. The Tribe depended on submerged lands for everything from water potatoes harvested from the lake to fish weirs and traps anchored in riverbeds and banks. Id., at 1100.~    ~    ~      3~      Under an 1846 treaty with Great Britain, the United States acquired title to the region of Lake Coeur d'Alene, see Treaty in Regard to Limits Westward of the Rocky Mountains, 9 Stat. 869, subject to the aboriginal right of possession held by resident tribes, see generally Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y. v. County of Oneida, 414 U.S. 661, 667 (1974); F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 486-493 (1982 ed.). In 1867, in the face of immigration into the Tribe's aboriginal territory, 95 F. Supp. 2d, at 1102, President Johnson issued an Executive Order setting aside a reservation of comparatively modest size, although the Tribe was apparently unaware of this action until at least 1871, when it petitioned the Government to set aside a reservation, id., at 1102-1103. The Tribe found the 1867 boundaries unsatisfactory, due in part to their failure to make adequate provision for fishing and other uses of important waterways. When the Tribe petitioned the Commissioner of Indian Affairs a second time, it insisted on a reservation that included key river valleys because \"we are not as yet quite up to living on farming\" and \"for a while yet we need have some hunting and fishing.\" App. 27.~    ~    ~      4~      Following further negotiations, the Tribe in 1873 agreed to relinquish (for compensation) all claims to its aboriginal lands outside the bounds of a more substantial reservation that negotiators for the United States agreed to \"set apart and secure\" \"for the exclusive use of the Coeur d'Alene Indians, and to protect . . . from settlement or occupancy by other persons.\" Id., at 33. The reservation boundaries described in the agreement covered part of the St. Joe River (then called the St. Joseph), and all of Lake Coeur d'Alene except a sliver cut off by the northern boundary. Id., at 33-34; 95 F. Supp. 2d, at 1095-1096.~    ~    ~      5~      Although by its own terms the agreement was not binding without congressional approval, App. 36-37, later in 1873 President Grant issued an Executive Order directing that the reservation specified in the agreement be \"withdrawn from sale and set apart as a reservation for the Cur d'Alne Indians.\" Exec. Order of Nov. 8, 1873, reprinted in 1 C. Kapler, Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties 837 (1904). The 1873 Executive Order set the northern boundary of the reservation directly across Lake Coeur d'Alene, which, the District Court found, was contrary \"to the usual practice of meandering a survey line along the mean high water mark.\" 95 F. Supp. 2d, at 1108; App. 14, 20 (expert trial testimony).2 An 1883 Government survey fixed the reservation's total area at 598,499.85 acres, which the District Court found necessarily \"included submerged lands within the reservation boundaries.\" 95 F. Supp. 2d, at 1108.~    ~    ~      6~      As of 1885, Congress had neither ratified the 1873 agreement nor compensated the Tribe. This inaction prompted the Tribe to petition the Government again, to \"make with us a proper treaty of peace and friendship ... by which your petitioners may be properly and fully compensated for such portion of their lands not now reserved to them; [and] that their present reserve may be confirmed to them.\" App. 350-351. In response, Congress authorized new negotiations to obtain the Tribe's agreement to cede land outside the borders of the 1873 reservation. Act of May 15, 1886, ch. 333, 24 Stat. 44. In 1887, the Tribe agreed to cede~    ~    ~      7~      \"all right, title, and claim which they now have, or ever had, to all lands in said Territories [Washington, Idaho, and Montana] and elsewhere, except the portion of land within the boundaries of their present reservation in the Territory of Idaho, known as the Coeur d'Alene Reservation.\" App. 378. The Government, in return, promised to compensate the Tribe, and agreed that \"[i]n consideration of the foregoing cession and agreements ... the Coeur d'Alene Reservation shall be held forever as Indian land and as homes for the Coeur d'Alene Indians ... and no part of said reservation shall ever be sold, occupied, open to white settlement, or otherwise disposed of without the consent of the Indians residing on said reservation.\" Id., at 379.~    ~    ~      8~      As before, the agreement was not binding on either party until ratified by Congress. Id., at 382.~    ~    ~      9~      In January 1888, not having as yet ratified any agreement with the Tribe, the Senate expressed uncertainty about the extent of the Tribe's reservation and adopted a resolution directing the Secretary of the Interior to \"inform the Senate as to the extent of the present area and boundaries of the Coeur d'Alene Indian Reservation in the Territory of Idaho,\" and specifically, \"whether such area includes any portion, and if so, about how much of the navigable waters of Lake Coeur d'Alene, and of Coeur d'Alene and St. Joseph Rivers.\" S. Misc. Doc. No. 36, 50th Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1888). The Secretary responded in February 1888 with a report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, stating that \"the reservation appears to embrace all the navigable waters of Lake Coeur d'Alene, except a very small fragment cut off by the north boundary of the reservation,\" and that \"[t]he St. Joseph River also flows through the reservation.\" S. Exec. Doc. No. 76, 50th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1888). Based largely, it appears, on this report, Idaho conceded in the Court of Appeals (as it does here) that the 1873 Executive Order reservation included submerged lands. See Opening Brief for Appellant in No. 98-35831 (CA9), p. 17 (\"Certainly, the State concedes that by 1888, the executive branch had construed the 1873 Coeur d'Alene Reservation as including submerged lands\"); Brief for Petitioner 17.~    ~    ~      10~      In May 1888, shortly after receiving the Secretary's report, Congress passed an Act granting a right-of-way to the Washington and Idaho Railroad Company \"for the extension of its railroad through the lands in Idaho Territory set apart for the use of the Coeur d'Alene Indians by executive order, commonly known as the Coeur d'Alene Indian Reservation.\" Act of May 30, 1888, ch. 336, 1, 25 Stat. 160. Notably, the Act directed that the Tribe's consent be obtained and that the Tribe alone (no one else being mentioned) be compensated for the right-of-way, a part of which crossed over navigable waters within the reservation. Id., 3, 25 Stat. 161; see also Reply Brief for Petitioner 16.~    ~    ~      11~      Congress was not prepared to ratify the 1887 agreement, however, owing to a growing desire to obtain for the public not only any interest of the Tribe in land outside the 1873 reservation, but certain portions of the reservation itself. The House Committee on Indian Affairs later recalled that the 1887 agreement was not promptly ratified for \"sundry reasons, among which was a desire on the part of the United States to acquire an additional area, to wit, a certain valuable portion of the reservation specially dedicated to the exclusive use of said Indians under an Executive order of 1873, and which portions of said lands, situate[d] on the northern end of said reservation, is valuable and necessary to the citizens of the United States for sundry reasons. It contains numerous, extensive, and valuable mineral ledges. It contains large bodies of valuable timber... . It contains a magnificent sheet of water, the Coeur d'Alene Lake ... .\" H. R. Rep. No. 1109, 51st Cong., 1st Sess., 4 (1890).~    ~    ~      12~      But Congress did not simply alter the 1873 boundaries unilaterally. Instead, the Tribe was understood to be entitled beneficially to the reservation as then defined, and the 1889 Indian Appropriations Act included a provision directing the Secretary of the Interior \"to negotiate with the Coeur d'Alene tribe of Indians,\" and, specifically, to negotiate \"for the purchase and release by said tribe of such portions of its reservation not agricultural and valuable chiefly for minerals and timber as such tribe shall consent to sell.\" Act of Mar. 2, 1889, ch. 412, 4, 25 Stat. 1002. Later that year, the Tribe and Government negotiators reached a new agreement under which the Tribe would cede the northern portion of the reservation, including approximately two-thirds of Lake Coeur d'Alene, in exchange for $500,000. App. 198; see also 95 F. Supp. 2d, at 1113. The new boundary line, like the old one, ran across the lake, and General Simpson, a negotiator for the United States, reassured the Tribe that \"you still have the St. Joseph River and the lower part of the lake.\" App. 183. And, again, the agreement was not to be binding on either party until both it and the 1887 agreement were ratified by Congress. Id., at 199.~    ~    ~      13~      On June 7, 1890, the Senate passed a bill ratifying both the 1887 and 1889 agreements. S. 2828, 51st Cong., 1st Sess. (1890); 21 Cong. Rec. 5769-5770 (1890). On June 10, the Senate bill was referred to the House, where a parallel bill had already been reported by the House Committee on Indian Affairs. H. R. Rep. No. 1109, 51st Cong., 1st Sess. (1890); see 21 Cong. Rec. 2775 (1890).~    ~    ~      14~      On July 3, 1890, while the Senate bill was under consideration by the House Committee on Indian Affairs, Congress passed the Idaho Statehood Act, admitting Idaho into the Union \"on an equal footing with the original States,\" Act of July 3, 1890, ch. 656, 26 Stat. 215. The Statehood Act \"accepted, ratified, and confirmed\" the Idaho Constitution, ibid., which \"forever disclaim[ed] all right and title to ... all lands lying within [Idaho] owned or held by any Indians or Indian tribes\" and provided that \"until the title thereto shall have been extinguished by the United States, the same shall be subject to the disposition of the United States, and said Indian lands shall remain under the absolute jurisdiction and control of the congress of the United States,\" Idaho Const., Art. XXI, 19 (1890).~    ~    ~      15~      A little over a month later, on August 19, 1890, the House Committee on Indian Affairs reported that the Senate bill ratifying the 1887 and 1889 agreements was identical to the House bill that it had already recommended. H. R. Rep. No. 2988, 51st Cong., 1st Sess. (1890). On March 3, 1891, Congress \"accepted, ratified, and confirmed\" both the 1887 and 1889 agreements with the Tribe. Act of Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 543, 19, 20, 26 Stat. 1027, 1029. The Act also directed the Secretary of the Interior to convey to one Frederick Post a \"portion of [the] reservation,\" id., at 1031, that the Tribe had purported to sell to Post in 1871.3 The property, located on the Spokane River and known as Post Falls, was described as \"all three of the river channels and islands, with enough land on the north and south shores for water-power and improvements.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      16~      In 1894, Congress approved yet another agreement with the Tribe, this time for the cession of a lakeside townsite called Harrison, within the boundary of the ratified reservation. Act of Aug. 15, 1894, ch. 290, 28 Stat. 322, agreement reprinted in App. 389; see also 95 F. Supp. 2d, at 1117. The agreement with the Tribe described the cession as covering \"all the land\" embraced within a tract that included a portion of the lake. App. 392. Like the earlier railroad cession, this one was subject to compensation to the Tribe and no one else.~    ~    ~      17~      The United States, acting in its own capacity and as trustee for the Tribe, initiated this action against the State of Idaho to quiet title (in the United States, to be held for the use and benefit of the Tribe) to the submerged lands within the exterior boundaries of the Tribe's current reservation, which encompass the lower third of Lake Coeur d'Alene and part of the St. Joe River.4 The Tribe intervened to assert its interest in the submerged lands, and Idaho counterclaimed, seeking to quiet title in its own favor. Ibid. Following a 9-day trial, the District Court quieted title \"in favor of the United States, as trustee, and the Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho, as the beneficially interested party of the trusteeship, to the bed and banks of the Coeur d'Alene Lake and the St. Joe River lying within the current boundaries of the Coeur d'Alene Indian Reservation.\" 95 F. Supp. 2d, at 1117. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 210 F.3d 1067 (2000). We granted certiorari, 531 U.S. 1050 (2000), and we now affirm.~    ~    II~    ~      18~      Due to the public importance of navigable waterways, ownership of the land underlying such waters is \"strongly identified with the sovereign power of government.\" Montana v. United States, 450 U.S. 544, 552 (1981). See generally Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U.S. 261, 284 (1997); United States v. Alaska, 521 U.S. 1, 5 (1997). In order to allow new States to enter the Union on an \"equal footing\" with the original States with regard to this important interest, \"the United States early adopted and constantly has adhered to the policy of regarding lands under navigable waters in acquired territory ... as held for the ultimate benefit of future States.\" United States v. Holt State Bank, 270 U.S. 49, 55 (1926); see also Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U.S. 1, 48-50 (1894). Therefore, in contrast to the law governing surface land held by the United States, see Scott v. Lattig, 227 U.S. 229, 244 (1913), the default rule is that title to land under navigable waters passes from the United States to a newly admitted State. Shively, supra, at 26-50. Specifically, although Congress has the power before statehood to convey land beneath navigable waters, and to reserve such land for the United States, \" '[a] court deciding a question of title to the bed of navigable water must . . . begin with a strong presumption' against defeat of a State's title.\" Alaska, supra, at 34 (quoting Montana, supra, at 552).~    ~    ~      19~      Armed with that presumption, we have looked to Congress's declarations and intent when we have had to resolve conflicts over submerged lands claimed to have been reserved or conveyed by the United States before statehood. Alaska, supra, at 36 (\"Whether title to submerged lands rests with a State, of course, is ultimately a matter of federal intent\"); Utah Div. of State Lands v. United States, 482 U.S. 193, 201-202 (1987); Montana, supra, at 550-557; Holt State Bank, supra, at 57-59; Alaska Pacific Fisheries v. United States, 248 U.S. 78, 87-90 (1918); Shively, supra, at 48-51.~    ~    ~      20~      The issue of congressional intent is refined somewhat when submerged lands are located within a tract that the National Government has dealt with in some special way before statehood, as by reserving lands for a particular national purpose such as a wildlife refuge or, as here, an Indian reservation. Because reserving submerged lands does not necessarily imply the intent \"to defeat a future State's title to the land,\" Utah Div. of State Lands, supra, at 202, we undertake a two-step enquiry in reservation cases. We ask whether Congress intended to include land under navigable waters within the federal reservation and, if so, whether Congress intended to defeat the future State's title to the submerged lands. Alaska, supra, at 36; Utah, supra, at 202.~    ~    ~      21~      Our most recent case of this sort, United States v. Alaska, supra, addressed two parcels of land initially reserved not by Congress but, as here, by the Executive Branch. We explained that the two-step test of congressional intent is satisfied when an Executive reservation clearly includes submerged lands, and Congress recognizes the reservation in a way that demonstrates an intent to defeat state title. Id., at 41-46, 55-61. We considered whether Congress was on notice that the Executive reservation included submerged lands, see id., at 42, 45, 56, and whether the purpose of the reservation would have been compromised if the submerged lands had passed to the State, id., at 42-43, 45-46, 58. Where the purpose would have been undermined, we explained, \"[i]t is simply not plausible that the United States sought to reserve only the upland portions of the area,\" id., at 39-40.~    ~    ~      22~      Here, Idaho has conceded that \"the executive branch had intended, or by 1888 had interpreted, the 1873 Executive Order Reservation to include submerged lands.\" Brief for Petitioner 17. The concession is a sound one. A right to control the lakebed and adjacent waters was traditionally important to the Tribe, which emphasized in its petition to the Government that it continued to depend on fishing. Cf. Montana, supra, at 556 (finding no intent to include submerged lands within a reservation where the tribe did not depend on fishing or use of navigable water). The District Court found that the acreage determination of the reserved area in 1883 necessarily included the area of the lakebed within the unusual boundary line crossing the lake from east to west. Cf. Alaska, supra, at 39 (concluding that a boundary following the ocean side of offshore islands necessarily embraced submerged lands shoreward of the islands). In light of those findings and Idaho's concession, the parties here concentrate on the second question, of Congress's intent to defeat Idaho's title to the submerged lands.5~    ~    ~      23~      In the Court of Appeals, Idaho also conceded one point covered in this second part of the enquiry. It agreed that after the Secretary of Interior's 1888 report that the reservation embraced nearly \"all the navigable water of Lake Coeur d'Alene,\" S. Exec. Doc. No. 76, 50th Cong., 1st Sess., at 3, Congress was on notice that the Executive Order reservation included submerged lands. Opening Brief for Appellant in No. 98-35831 (CA9), at 11 (\"[Congress was] informed that the Coeur d'Alene Reservation embraced submerged lands\"). Again, Idaho's concession was prudent in light of the District Court's findings of facts. 95 F. Supp. 2d, at 1114 (\"The evidence shows that prior to Idaho's statehood, Congress was on notice that the Executive Order of 1873 reserved for the benefit of the Tribe the submerged lands within the boundaries of the Coeur d'Alene Reservation\").~    ~    ~      24~      The District Court did not merely impute to Congress knowledge of the land survey, but also explained how the submerged lands and related water rights had been continuously important to the Tribe throughout the period prior to congressional action confirming the reservation and granting Idaho statehood. And the District Court made the following findings about the period preceding negotiations authorized by Congress:~    ~    ~      25~      \"The facts demonstrate that an influx of non-Indians into the Tribe's aboriginal territory prompted the Federal Government to negotiate with the Coeur d'Alenes in an attempt to confine the Tribe to a reservation and to obtain the Tribe's release of its aboriginal lands for settlement. Before it would agree to these conditions, however, the Tribe demanded an enlarged reservation that included the Lakes and rivers. Thus, the Federal Government could only achieve its goals of promoting settlement, avoiding hostilities and extinguishing aboriginal title by agreeing to a reservation that included the submerged lands.\" Id., at 1107.6 This, in summary, was the background for the 1873 Executive Order's inclusion of submerged lands, which in turn were the subject of the 1888 request by the Senate to the Secretary of the Interior for advice about the Tribe's rights over the \"navigable waters of Lake Coeur d'Alene and the Coeur d'Alene and St. Joseph Rivers,\" S. Mis. Doc. No. 36, 50th Cong., 1st Sess., at 1. As noted, the Secretary answered in the affirmative, S. Exec. Doc. No. 76, 50th Cong., 1st Sess., at 3, consistently with the survey indicating that the submerged lands were within the reservation. Thus, the District Court remarked that it would be difficult to imagine circumstances that could have made it more plain to Congress that submerged lands were within the reservation. 95 F. Supp. 2d, at 1114.~    ~    ~      26~      The manner in which Congress then proceeded to deal with the Tribe shows clearly that preservation of the land within the reservation, absent contrary agreement with the Tribe, was central to Congress's complementary objectives of dealing with pressures of white settlement and establishing the reservation by permanent legislation. The Tribe had shown its readiness to fight to preserve its land rights when in 1858 it defeated a force of the United States military, which it misunderstood as intending to take aboriginal lands. See H. R. Rep. No. 1109, 51st Cong., 1st Sess., at 2-3. The concern with hostility arose again in 1873 before the reservation boundaries were established, when a surveyor on the scene had warned the Surveyor General that \"[s]hould the fisheries be excluded there will in my opinion be trouble with these Indians.\" App. 30.~    ~    ~      27~      Hence, although the goal of extinguishing aboriginal title could have been achieved by congressional fiat, see Tee-Hit-Ton Indians v. United States, 348 U.S. 272, 279-282 (1955), and Congress was free to define the reservation boundaries however it saw fit, the goal of avoiding hostility seemingly could not have been attained without the agreement of the Tribe. Congress in any event made it expressly plain that its object was to obtain tribal interests only by tribal consent. When in 1886 Congress took steps toward extinguishing aboriginal title to all lands outside the 1873 boundaries, it did so by authorizing negotiation of agreements ceding title for compensation. Soon after that, when Congress decided to seek a reduction in the size of the 1873 reservation itself, the Secretary of Interior advised the Senate against fiddling with the scope of the reservation without the Tribe's agreement. The report of February 1888 likewise urged that any move to diminish the reservation \"should be done, if done at all, with the full and free consent of the Indians, and they should, of course, receive proper compensation for any land so taken.\" App. 129. Accordingly, after receiving the Secretary's report, Congress undertook in the 1889 Act to authorize negotiation with the Tribe for the consensual, compensated cession of such portions of the Tribe's reservation \"as such tribe shall consent to sell,\" Act of Mar. 2, 1889, ch. 412, 4, 25 Stat. 1002. In the meantime it honored the reservation's recently clarified boundaries by requiring that the Tribe be compensated for the Washington and Idaho Railroad Company right-of-way, Act of May 30, 1888, ch. 336, 1, 25 Stat. 160.~    ~    ~      28~      The facts, including the provisions of Acts of Congress in 1886, 1888, and 1889, thus demonstrate that Congress understood its objective as turning on the Tribe's agreement to the abrogation of any land claim it might have and to any reduction of the 1873 reservation's boundaries. The explicit statutory provisions requiring agreement of the Tribe were unchanged right through to the point of Congress's final 1891 ratification of the reservation, in an Act that of course contained no cession by the Tribe of submerged lands within the reservation's outer boundaries. Nor, it should be added, is there any hint in the evidence that delay in final passage of the ratifying Act was meant to pull a fast one by allowing the reservation's submerged lands to pass to Idaho under a legal presumption, by virtue of the Statehood Act approved eight months before Congress took final action on the reservation. There is no evidence that the Act confirming the reservation was delayed for any reason but comparison of the respective House and Senate bills, to assure that they were identical prior to the House's passage of the Senate version.7~    ~    ~      29~      The record thus answers the State's argument that, because the 1889 Act indicates that Congress sought to obtain portions of the reservation \"valuable chiefly for minerals and timber,\" Congress was not necessarily thinking one thing or another about the balance of the reservation land. Reply Brief for Petitioner 6-7; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 12-13. The argument simply ignores the evidence that Congress did know that the reservation included submerged lands, and that it authorized the reservation's modification solely by agreement. The intent, in other words, was that anything not consensually ceded by the Tribe would remain for the Tribe's benefit, an objective flatly at odds with Idaho's view that Congress meant to transfer the balance of submerged lands to the State in what would have amounted to an act of bad faith accomplished by unspoken operation of law. Indeed, the implausibility of the State's current position is underscored by the fact that it made a contrary argument in the Court of Appeals, where it emphasized the District Court's finding that the 1889 Act was an authorization \"to negotiate with the Tribe for a release of the submerged lands,\" and recognized that \"[Congress was] informed that the Coeur d'Alene Reservation embraced submerged lands.\" Opening Brief for Appellant in No. 98-35831 (CA9), at 11, 31.~    ~    ~      30~      Idaho's position is at odds not only with evidence of congressional intent before statehood, but also with later congressional understanding that statehood had not affected the submerged lands in question. Eight months after passing the Statehood Act, Congress ratified the 1887 and 1889 agreements in their entireties (including language in the 1887 agreement that \"the Coeur d'Alene Reservation shall be held forever as Indian land\"), with no signal that some of the land over which the parties to those agreements had negotiated had passed in the interim to Idaho. The ratification Act suggested in a further way Congress's understanding that the 1873 reservation's submerged lands had not passed to the State, by including a provision confirming the Tribe's sale of river channels to Frederick Post. Confirmation would have been beyond Congress's power if title to the submerged riverbed had already passed to the State.8 Finally, the Act of Congress ceding the portion of reservation land for the townsite of Harrison confirms Congress's understanding that the lakebed within the reservation's boundaries was part of the reservation. Only three years after the Act confirming the reservation, the townsite cession was treated just as the right-of-way for the railroad had been treated before statehood. The Tribe (and no one else) was compensated for a cession whose bounds suggested inclusion of submerged lands; the boundary lines did not stop at the water's edge and meander the entire shore, but continued into the area of the lake to encompass submerged territory that the National Government simply could not have conveyed if it had passed to Idaho at the time of statehood.9~    ~    ~      31~      In sum, Congress undertook to negotiate with the Coeur d'Alene Tribe for reduction in the territory of an Executive Order reservation that Idaho concedes included the submerged lands at issue here. Congress was aware that the submerged lands were included and clearly intended to redefine the area of the reservation that covered them only by consensual transfer, in exchange for the guarantee that the Tribe would retain the remainder. There is no indication that Congress ever modified its objective of negotiated consensual transfer, which would have been defeated if Congress had let parts of the reservation pass to the State before the agreements with the Tribe were final. Any imputation to Congress either of bad faith or of secrecy in dropping its express objective of consensual dealing with the Tribe is at odds with the evidence. We therefore think the negotiating history, not to mention subsequent events, \"ma[k]e [it] very plain,\" Holt State Bank, 270 U.S., at 55, that Congress recognized the full extent of the Executive Order reservation lying within the stated boundaries it ultimately confirmed, and intended to bar passage to Idaho of title to the submerged lands at issue here.~    ~    ~      32~      The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.~    ~    ~      33~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      34~      Rehnquist, C. J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ., joined.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         Petitioner, the State of Idaho, did not challenge the District Court's factual findings on appeal. See 210 F.3d 1067, 1070 (CA9 2000).~      ~      ~        2~         Although the State did not challenge the District Court's factual findings below, it claims in its reply brief to us that is was \"commonplace\" for reservation boundaries to cross navigable waters. Reply Brief for Petitioner 9. Ultimately, this factual dispute is of little consequence; the District Court found that the boundary and acreage calculations showed the understanding of the Government and the Tribe that submerged lands were included, 95 F. Supp. 2d, at 1108, and the State conceded on appeal that \"[c]ertainly, ... by 1888, the executive branch had construed the 1873 Coeur d'Alene Reservation as including submerged lands.\" Opening Brief for Appellant in No. 98-35831 (CA9), p. 17.~      ~      ~        3~         See generally, e.g., Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y. v. County of Oneida, 44 U.S. 661, 667-668 (1974) (under common law and various Nonintercourse Acts, Indian title can only be extinguished with federal consent).~      ~      ~        4~         Because this action was brought by the United States, it does not implicate the Eleventh Amendment bar raised when the Tribe pressed its own claim to the submerged lands in Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U.S. 261 (1997). See Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 614 (1983).   The United States's complaint was apparently motivated by Idaho's issuance of permits for the construction of \"docks, piers, floats, pilings, breakwaters, boat ramps and other such aids to navigation within the southern one-third of Coeur d'Alene Lake.\" Complaint in CIV94-0328-N-EJL (D. Idaho), pp. 6-7.~      ~      ~        5~         The District Court and Court of Appeals accepted the United States's position that it had reserved the submerged lands, and that Congress intended that reservation to defeat Idaho's title. They did not reach the Tribe's alternative theory that, notwithstanding the scope of any reservation, the Tribe retained aboriginal title to the submerged lands, which cannot be extinguished without explicit action by Congress, see Oneida Indian Nation, 414 U.S., at 667-668; cf. United States v. Winans, 198 U.S. 371, 381 (1905) (explaining that a treaty ceding some aboriginal lands to the United States and setting apart other lands as a reservation \"was not a grant of rights to the Indians, but a grant of rights from them-a reservation of those not granted\"). The Tribe does not press its unextinguished-aboriginal-title argument here. See Brief for Respondent Coeur d'Alene Tribe 25, n. 12.~      ~      ~        6~         See also Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Annual Report (1873), reprinted in App. 45 (explaining that Tribe was dissatisfied with a previous reservation and that the 1873 agreement was required \"[f]or the purpose of extinguishing [the Tribe's] claim to all the tract of country claimed by them\"). See generally Montana v. United States, 450 U.S. 544, 556 (1981) (creation of Indian reservation is appropriate public purpose justifying defeat of state title to submerged lands).~      ~      ~        7~         Given the preceding discussion of, among other things, the earlier congressional Acts, it should go without saying that this reference to the fact that the Senate passed the ratification Act before statehood is not intended to suggest that the Senate action constituted the enactment of an expression of intent on behalf of the whole Congress, let alone that it was sufficient of itself to defeat Idaho's title to the submerged lands. But cf. post, at 5.~      ~      ~        8~         The State says that the conveyance to Post included land that was outside the boundary of the 1873 reservation. Reply Brief for Petitioner 18. That merely suggests the possibility that Congress intended to defeat the State's title to even more territory than the United States is claiming here. The State also hypothesizes that the relevant portions of the Spokane River may not have been considered navigable at the time of the conveyance, ibid., in which case the equal footing doctrine would not apply and the conveyance would say nothing about Congress's intent with regard to submerged lands underlying navigable waters. We need not resolve this factual question, which was not addressed below. Suffice it to say that Congress's actions in 1891 were consistent with an understanding that the State did not have title to the riverbeds conveyed to Post, which, along with the later Harrison cession of part of the concededly navigable lake, is consistent with an understanding that no submerged lands within the reservation's stated boundaries had passed to Idaho.~      ~      ~        9~         Here, we agree with the dissent, post, at 4, that Congress cannot, after statehood, reserve or convey submerged lands that \"ha[ve] already been bestowed\" upon a State. See Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U.S. 1, 26-28 (1894) (citing Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan, 3 How. 212 (1845)). Our point in mentioning Congress's actions after statehood is merely to confirm what Congress's prestatehood actions already make clear: that the lands at issue here were not bestowed upon Idaho at statehood, because Congress intended that they remain tribal reservation lands barring agreement to the contrary.~      ~    ~    ~      35~      Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.~    ~    ~      36~      The Court makes out a plausible case for the proposition that, on the day Idaho was admitted to the Union, the Executive Branch of the Federal Government had intended to retain in trust for the Coeur d'Alene Indian Tribe the submerged lands under a portion of Lake Coeur d'Alene. But the existence of such intent on the part of the Executive Branch is simply not enough to defeat an incoming State's title to submerged lands within its borders. Decisions of this Court going back more than 150 years establish this proposition beyond a shadow of a doubt.~    ~    ~      37~      \"[T]he ownership of land under navigable waters,\" it bears repeating, \"is an incident of sovereignty.\" Montana v. United States, 450 U.S. 544, 551 (1981). Recognizing this important relationship, this Court \"announced the principle that the United States held the lands under navigable waters in the Territories 'in trust' for the future States that would be created.\" Utah Div. of State Lands v. United States, 482 U.S. 193, 196 (1987) (quoting Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan, 3 How. 212, 230 (1845)). That duty may not lightly be disregarded, and, as the Court rightly observes, our inquiry \"begin[s] with a strong presumption against defeat of a State's title.\" Ante, at 9 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Accordingly, \"disposals [of submerged lands] by the United States during the territorial period ... should not be regarded as intended unless the intention was definitely declared or otherwise made very plain.\" United States v. Holt State Bank, 270 U.S. 49, 55 (1926); see also Montana, supra, at 552 (\"[The Court] must not infer such a conveyance unless the intention was definitely declared or otherwise made very plain, or was rendered in clear and especial words, or unless the claim confirmed in terms embraces the land under the waters of the stream\") (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).~    ~    ~      38~      The Court makes three critical mistakes in its application of the equal footing doctrine here-errors that significantly dilute the doctrine. First and foremost, the Court misconceives the scope of historical events directly relevant to the question whether Congress had, by July 3, 1890, acted to withhold title to submerged lands from the entering State of Idaho. At the very moment that Idaho entered the Union \"on an equal footing with the original States,\" Act of July 3, 1890, ch. 656, 26 Stat. 215, Congress and the President vested in Idaho the accoutrements of sovereignty, including title to submerged lands. It is therefore improper for the Court to look to events after Idaho's admission in order to discern whether Congress had months or years previously intended to divest the entering State of its submerged lands. Indeed, I am aware of no case applying the equal footing doctrine to determine title to submerged lands in which this Court has looked beyond the moment of statehood for evidence of federal intent.~    ~    ~      39~      Our decision in United States v. Alaska, 521 U.S. 1 (1997), is particularly illustrative of the timeframe relevant to our inquiry. That case concerned in part Alaska's assumption of title to submerged lands within the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (Reserve) and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge). See id., at 4. In stark contrast to today's decision, the Court in its lengthy discussion in Alaska resisted entirely the temptation to delve into the treatment of the lands in question in the months and years following Alaska's admission to the Union in 1959. And the invitation to do so hardly could have been more obvious with respect to the Refuge, which had been \"set apart\" as a wildlife reservation but had not yet been formally approved by the Secretary of the Interior. Id., at 46-47. \"This application,\" the Court observed, \"was still pending in July 1958, when Congress passed the Alaska Statehood Act, and in January 1959, when Alaska was formally admitted to the Union.\" Id., at 46. Although the Court noted that the application was approved several months after Alaska's admission, the Court considered the pending application as relevant only insofar as it put Congress on notice of the action. See id., at 56. The Alaska Court did not give-contrary to the Court's reasoning in the present case-any import to the fact that the application ultimately was approved. Indeed, Alaska's focus on the instant of statehood as the crucial moment of inquiry could hardly be more clear. See, e.g., id., at 42 (\"The conclusion that Congress was aware when it passed the Alaska Statehood Act that the Reserve encompassed submerged lands is reinforced by other legislation, enacted just before Alaska's admission to the Union, granting certain offshore lands to the Territory of Alaska\"); id., at 55 (\"We now consider whether, prior to Alaska's admission to the Union, the United States defeated the future State's title to the submerged lands included within the proposed Range\") (emphases added). Other cases indicate a similar emphasis. See, e.g., Utah Div. of State Lands, 482 U.S., at 195; Montana, 450 U.S., at 551.1~    ~    ~      40~      Accordingly, insofar as the submerged lands at issue here are concerned, it is of no moment that Congress ultimately ratified the 1887 and 1889 negotiations. See ante, at 16. Well before it took such action, Congress had given its assent to Idaho's entry into the Union as a sovereign State and thereby joined with the Executive to extinguish the Federal Government's right to withhold title to submerged lands. It follows that Congress' acceptance of the fact that \"the Coeur d'Alene Reservation shall be held forever as Indian land,\" ibid., does nothing to explain whether submerged lands were within that reservation at the time of-much less eight months after-Idaho's admission. By the same token, our inquiry is not illuminated by Congress' attempt in 1891 to affirm Chief Seltice's purported conveyance of certain lands to Frederick Post, see ante, at 7, 16, or by Congress' approval in 1894 of the so-called \"Harrison cession,\" see ante, at 16-17. Simply put, the consequences of admission are instantaneous, and it ignores the uniquely sovereign character of that event for the Court to suggest that subsequent events somehow can diminish what has already been bestowed.~    ~    ~      41~      Second, all agree (at least in theory) that the question before us is \"whether Congress intended to include land under navigable waters within the federal reservation and, if so, whether Congress intended to defeat the future State's title to the submerged land,\" ante, at 10 (emphasis added). But the Court proceeds to determine this \"intent\" by considering what obviously are not Acts of Congress. Congress itself did authorize negotiations with the Tribe in 1886 and 1889, but those Acts expressly provided that any resulting agreements were not binding \"until ratified by Congress.\" Act of May 15, 1886, 24 Stat. 44, App. 51; Act of Mar. 2, 1889, 25 Stat. 1002, App. 144. And it is undisputed that ratification did not occur before Idaho gained admission. The Court, however, is willing to divine congressional intent to withhold submerged lands from the State from what are best described as inchoate pre-statehood proceedings. In the Court's view it is sufficient that one house of Congress had acted to approve the agreements and that the other was in the process of considering similar legislation. See ante, at 15. The Court thus speaks of the \"final\" ratification of the 1887 and 1889 negotiations as if the official approval of both houses of Congress was but a mere formality. Ibid. But see U.S. Const., Art. I, 7, cl. 2. But the indisputable fact remains that, as of July 3, 1890, \"Congress\" had passed the Idaho Statehood Act but had not ratified the 1887 and 1889 agreements.~    ~    ~      42~      Nor do our prior decisions in this area support the Court's decision to wander so far afield. In Alaska, we evaluated the impact of an express provision in the Alaska Statehood Act, Pub. L. 85-508, 72 Stat. 347, reserving certain lands for the United States. 521 U.S., at 41-42. There the evidence that \"Congress expressed a clear intent to defeat state title\" to submerged lands came in the form of a duly passed federal statute rather than as inferences drawn from preludes to future congressional Acts. Id., 41. Indeed, that Statehood Act abounds in specificity, in 11(b) directly identifying the Reserve, and in 6(e) defining other reserved lands in some detail.2 So, too, in Utah Division of State Lands we evaluated prestatehood federal statutes without reference to inchoate proceedings lacking the force of law. 482 U.S., at 198-200 (discussing the impact on Utah's claim to certain submerged lands of the Sundry Appropriations Act of 1888, 25 Stat. 505, and the Sundry Appropriations Act of 1890, ch. 837, 26 Stat. 371). Cf. Montana, supra, at 550-555 (considering whether certain treaties vested property rights in the Crow Indians). We thus wisely have not relied on this sort of evidence in the past, and it is unfortunate that we embark upon that route today.~    ~    ~      43~      Third, despite the critical relationship between submerged lands and sovereignty, the Court makes the unwarranted assumption that any use granted with respect to navigable waters must necessarily include reserving title to the submerged lands below them. As the Court previously has explained, the purpose underlying a reservation of territorial lands is often probative of federal intent. See, e.g., Alaska, 521 U.S., at 39. Even accepting the District Court's conclusions regarding the Tribe's dietary habits, and further accepting this Court's inference that Congress was concerned with the Tribe's access to navigable waters,3 it does not necessarily follow that Congress intended to reserve title in submerged lands by authorizing negotiations leading to the cession of portions of the reservation established by the 1873 Executive Order.~    ~    ~      44~      It is perfectly consistent with the assumption that Congress wanted to preserve the Coeur d'Alene Indians' way of life to conclude that, if Congress meant to grant the Tribe any interest in Lake Coeur d'Alene, it was more likely a right to fish and travel the waters rather than withholding for the Tribe's benefit perpetual title in the underlying lands. See Montana, 450 U.S., at 554 ([Although the treaty] gave the Crow Indians the sole right to use and occupy the reserved land, and, implicitly, the power to exclude others from it, the respondents' reliance on that provision simply begs the question of the precise extent of the conveyed lands to which this exclusivity attaches\"); see also ibid. (\"The mere fact that the bed of a navigable water lies within the boundaries described in the treaty does not make the riverbed part of the conveyed land, especially when there is no express reference to the riverbed that might overcome the presumption against its conveyance\").~    ~    ~      45~      For this reason, Congress' decision in 1888 to grant a right-of-way to the Washington and Idaho Railroad Company across a part of the Coeur d'Alene Reservation is not clear evidence of Congress' intent with respect to submerged lands. All but a miniscule portion of the right-of-way passes along surface lands, and it crosses the lake only at one of its narrowest points. There is no mention of submerged lands in the authorizing resolution, and it seems obvious that Congress required the company to pay compensation to the Tribe because of the significant impact the railroad would have upon surface lands:~    ~    ~      46~      \"[T]he right of way hereby granted to said company shall be seventy-five feet in width on each side of the central line of said railroad as aforesaid[;] and said company shall also have the right to take from said lands adjacent to the line of said road material, stone, earth, and timber necessary for the construction of said railroad; also, ground adjacent to such right of way for station-buildings, depots, machine-shops, side-tracks, turnouts, and water-stations, not to exceed in amount three hundred feet in width and three thousand feet in length for each station, to the extent one station for each ten miles of road.\" App. 138.~    ~    ~      47~      Thus, I do not think it just to infer any intent regarding submerged lands from Congress' requirement of compensation for what was to be primarily an intrusion-and a significant one at that-upon surface lands.~    ~    ~      48~      In sum, the evidence of congressional intent properly before the Court today fails to rise to anywhere near the level of certainty our cases require. Congress' desire to divest an entering State of its sovereign interest in submerged lands must be \"definitely declared or otherwise made very plain,\" Montana, supra, at 552. That standard has not been met here.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~         The Court of Appeals stated that \"we are aware of no rule forbidding consideration of such [post-statehood] events. Indeed, the case law may suggest the contrary. See Alaska Pacific Fisheries v. United States, 248 U.S. 78, 89-90 (1918).\" United States v. Idaho, 210 F.3d 1067, 1079, n. 17 (CA9 2000). This citation is puzzling indeed, for Alaska was not admitted to the Union until some 40 years after the Court's decision in Alaska Pacific Fisheries.~      ~      ~        2~         Again, the Court's reliance on language contained in the Idaho Statehood Act affirming the Idaho Constitution is unavailing. See ante, at 7. Clauses indicating that the entering State \"forever disclaims all right and title to ... all lands ... owned or held by any Indians or Indian tribes\" were boilerplate formulations at the time, and the inclusion of this language hardly compares to the precision employed in the Alaska Statehood Act. Indeed, every State admitted between the years 1889 and 1912 entered with such a disclaimer. See N. D. Const., Art. 16, 2 (1889); S. D. Const., Art. XXII, 18 (1889); Mont. Const., Ordinance I (1889); Wash. Const., Art. XXVI, 2 (1889); Wyo. Const., Ordinance 3 (1889); Utah Const., Art. III (1894); Okla. Const., Art. I, 3 (1906); N. M. Const., Art. XXI, 2 (1910); Ariz. Const., Art. XX, par. 4 (1910). Tellingly, in each of these Constitutions save Oklahoma's, the relevant language is identical to that in the Idaho Constitution. This disclaimer, in any event, simply begs the question whether submerged lands were in fact \"owned or held\" by the Coeur d'Alene Tribe upon Idaho's admission.~      ~      ~        3~         This inference may not be justified. Although Idaho apparently has conceded that the 1873 Executive Order included submerged lands within the reservation, that fact hardly confirms that Congress made a similar statement in simply authorizing negotiations with the Tribe. United States v. Alaska, 521 U.S. 1 (1997), moreover, indicates that it is at best an open question whether Executive action alone is sufficient to withhold title to submerged lands. Id., at 43-45; cf. U.S. Const., Art. IV, 3, cl. 2 (\"The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States\" (emphasis added)). Thus, the majority rests far too much weight on Idaho's concession regarding the 1873 Reservation.~      ~    ~    ",

CYR~    No. 00-767~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued April 24, 2001June 25, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      Before the effective dates of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 was interpreted to give the Attorney General broad discretion to waive deportation of resident aliens. As relevant here, the large class of aliens depending on 212(c) relief was reduced in 1996 by 401 of AEDPA, which identified a broad set of offenses for which convictions would preclude such relief; and by IIRIRA, which repealed 212(c) and replaced it with a new section excluding from the class anyone \"convicted of an aggravated felony,\" 8 U.S.C.  1229b(a)(3). Respondent St. Cyr, a lawful permanent United States resident, pleaded guilty to a criminal charge that made him deportable. He would have been eligible for a waiver of deportation under the immigration law in effect when he was convicted, but his removal proceedings were commenced after AEDPA's and IIRIRA's effective dates. The Attorney General claims that those Acts withdrew his authority to grant St. Cyr a waiver. The Federal District Court accepted St. Cyr's habeas corpus application and agreed that the new restrictions do not apply to removal proceedings brought against an alien who pleaded guilty to a deportable crime before their enactment. The Second Circuit affirmed.~      Held:~      1. Courts have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  2241 to decide the legal issue raised by St. Cyr's habeas petition. Pp. 7-24.~      (a) To prevail on its claim that AEDPA and IIRIRA stripped federal courts of jurisdiction to decide a pure question of law, as in this case, petitioner Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) must overcome both the strong presumption in favor of judicial review of administrative action and the longstanding rule requiring a clear and unambiguous statement of congressional intent to repeal habeas jurisdiction. Here, that plain statement rule draws additional reinforcement from other canons of statutory construction: First, when a statutory interpretation invokes the outer limits of Congress' power, there must be a clear indication that Congress intended that result; and second, if an otherwise acceptable construction would raise serious constitutional problems and an alternative interpretation is fairly possible, the statute must be construed to avoid such problems. Pp. 7-9.~      (b) Construing the amendments at issue to preclude court review of a pure question of law would give rise to substantial constitutional questions. The Constitution's Suspension Clause, which protects the privilege of the habeas corpus writ, unquestionably requires some judicial intervention in deportation cases. Heikkila v. Barber, 345 U.S. 229, 235. Even assuming that the Clause protects only the writ as it existed in 1789, substantial evidence supports St. Cyr's claim that pure questions of law could have been answered in 1789 by a common-law judge with power to issue the writ. Thus, a serious Suspension Clause issue would arise if the 1996 statutes have withdrawn that power from federal judges and provided no adequate substitute. The need to resolve such a serious and difficult constitutional question and the desirability of avoiding that necessity reinforce the reasons for requiring a clear and unambiguous statement of constitutional intent. Pp. 9-14.~      (c) To conclude that the writ is no longer available in this context would also represent a marked departure from historical immigration law practice. The writ has always been available to review the legality of executive detention, see e.g., Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 663, and, until the 1952 Act, a habeas action was the sole means of challenging a deportation order's legality, see, e.g., Heikkila, 345 U.S., at 235. Habeas courts have answered questions of law in alien suits challenging Executive interpretations of immigration law and questions of law that arose in the discretionary relief context. Pp. 14-17.~      (d) Neither AEDPA 401(e) nor three IIRIRA provisions, 8 U.S.C.  1252(a)(1), (a)(2)(C), and (b)(9), express a clear and unambiguous statement of Congress' intent to bar 28 U.S.C.  2241 petitions. None of these sections even mentions 2241. Section 401(e)'s repeal of a subsection of the 1961 Act, which provided, inter alia, habeas relief for an alien in custody pursuant to a deportation order, is not sufficient to eliminate what the repealed section did not grant namely, habeas jurisdiction pursuant to 2241. See Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wall. 85, 105-106. The three IIRIRA provisions do not speak with sufficient clarity to bar habeas jurisdiction. They focus on \"judicial review\" or \"jurisdiction to review.\" In the immigration context, however, \"judicial review\" and \"habeas corpus\" have historically distinct meanings, with habeas courts playing a far narrower role. Pp. 17-24.~      2. Section 212(c) relief remains available for aliens, like St. Cyr, whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who, notwithstanding those convictions, would have been eligible for 212(c) relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect. Pp. 24-36.~      (a) A statute's language must require that it be applied retroactively. Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U.S. 204, 208. The first step in the impermissible-retroactive-effect determination is to ascertain whether Congress has directed with the requisite clarity that the law be applied retrospectively. Martin v. Hadix, 527 U.S. 343, 352. Such clarity is not shown by the comprehensiveness of IIRIRA's revision of federal immigration law, see Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 260-261, by the promulgation of IIRIRA's effective date, see id., at 257, or by IIRIRA 309(c)(1)'s \"saving provision.\" Pp. 24-30.~      (b) The second step is to determine whether IIRIRA attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment, a judgment informed and guided by considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations. Landgraf, 511 U.S., at 270. IIRIRA's elimination of 212(c) relief for people who entered into plea agreements expecting that they would be eligible for such relief clearly attaches a new disability to past transactions or considerations. Plea agreements involve a quid pro quo between a criminal defendant and the government, and there is little doubt that alien defendants considering whether to enter into such agreements are acutely aware of their convictions' immigration consequences. The potential for unfairness to people like St. Cyr is significant and manifest. Now that prosecutors have received the benefit of plea agreements, facilitated by the aliens' belief in their continued eligibility for 212(c) relief, it would be contrary to considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations to hold that IIRIRA deprives them of any possibility of such relief. The INS' argument that application of deportation law can never have retroactive effect because deportation proceedings are inherently prospective is not particularly helpful in undertaking Landgraf's analysis, and the fact that deportation is not punishment for past crimes does not mean that the Court cannot consider an alien's reasonable reliance on the continued availability of discretionary relief from deportation when deciding the retroactive effect of eliminating such relief. That 212(c) relief is discretionary does not affect the propriety of this Court's conclusion, for there is a clear difference between facing possible deportation and facing certain deportation. Pp. 30-36.229 F.3d 406, affirmed.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OFAPPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT~      Stevens, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Kennedy, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.~      Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      Both the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), enacted on April 24, 1996, 110 Stat. 1214, and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), enacted on September 30, 1996, 110 Stat. 3009-546, contain comprehensive amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 66 Stat. 163, as amended, 8 U.S.C.  1101 et seq. This case raises two important questions about the impact of those amendments. The first question is a procedural one, concerning the effect of those amendments on the availability of habeas corpus jurisdiction under 28 U.S. C. 2241. The second question is a substantive one, concerning the impact of the amendments on conduct that occurred before their enactment and on the availability of discretionary relief from deportation.~    ~    ~      2~      Respondent, Enrico St. Cyr, is a citizen of Haiti who was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in 1986. Ten years later, on March 8, 1996, he pled guilty in a state court to a charge of selling a controlled substance in violation of Connecticut law. That conviction made him deportable. Under pre-AEDPA law applicable at the time of his conviction, St. Cyr would have been eligible for a waiver of deportation at the discretion of the Attorney General. However, removal proceedings against him were not commenced until April 10, 1997, after both AEDPA and IIRIRA became effective, and, as the Attorney General interprets those statutes, he no longer has discretion to grant such a waiver.~    ~    ~      3~      In his habeas corpus petition, respondent has alleged that the restrictions on discretionary relief from deportation contained in the 1996 statutes do not apply to removal proceedings brought against an alien who pled guilty to a deportable crime before their enactment. The District Court accepted jurisdiction of his application and agreed with his submission. In accord with the decisions of four other Circuits, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.1 229 F.3d 406 (2000). The importance of both questions warranted our grant of certiorari. 531 U.S. 1107 (2001).~    ~    ~      4~      * The character of the prenbhyph;AEDPA and pre-IIRIRA law that gave the Attorney General discretion to waive deportation in certain cases is relevant to our appraisal of both the substantive and the procedural questions raised by the petition of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). We shall therefore preface our discussion of those questions with an overview of the sources, history, and scope of that law.~    ~    ~      5~      Subject to certain exceptions, 3 of the Immigration Act of 1917 excluded from admission to the United States several classes of aliens, including, for example, those who had committed crimes \"involving moral turpitude.\" 39 Stat. 875. The seventh exception provided \"[t]hat aliens returning after a temporary absence to an unrelinquished United States domicile of seven consecutive years may be admitted in the discretion of the Secretary of Labor, and under such conditions as he may prescribe.\" Id., at 878.2 Although that provision applied literally only to exclusion proceedings, and although the deportation provisions of the statute did not contain a similar provision, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) relied on 3 to grant relief in deportation proceedings involving aliens who had departed and returned to this country after the ground for deportation arose. See, e.g., Matter of L, 1 I.  N. Dec. 1, 2 (1940).3~    ~    ~      6~      Section 212 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which replaced and roughly paralleled 3 of the 1917 Act, excluded from the United States several classes of aliens, including those convicted of offenses involving moral turpitude or the illicit traffic in narcotics. See 66 Stat. 182-187. As with the prior law, this section was subject to a proviso granting the Attorney General broad discretion to admit excludable aliens. See id., at 187. That proviso, codified at 8 U.S.C.  1182(c), stated:~    ~    ~      7~      \"Aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation, and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years, may be admitted in the discretion of the Attorney General   .\"Like 3 of the 1917 Act, 212(c) was literally applicable only to exclusion proceedings, but it too has been interpreted by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) to authorize any permanent resident alien with \"a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years\" to apply for a discretionary waiver from deportation. See Matter of Silva, 16 I.  N. Dec. 26, 30 (1976) (adopting position of Francis v. INS, 532 F.2d 268 (CA2 1976)). If relief is granted, the deportation proceeding is terminated and the alien remains a permanent resident.~    ~    ~      8~      The extension of 212(c) relief to the deportation context has had great practical importance, because deportable offenses have historically been defined broadly. For example, under the Immigration and Nationality Act, aliens are deportable upon conviction for two crimes of \"moral turpitude\" (or for one such crime if it occurred within five years of entry into the country and resulted in a jail term of at least one year). See 8 U.S.C.  1227(a)(2)(A)(i)-(ii) (1994 ed., Supp. V). In 1988, Congress further specified that an alien is deportable upon conviction for any \"aggravated felony,\" Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, 102 Stat. 4469-4470, 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), which was defined to include numerous offenses without regard to how long ago they were committed.4 Thus, the class of aliens whose continued residence in this country has depended on their eligibility for 212(c) relief is extremely large, and not surprisingly, a substantial percentage of their applications for 212(c) relief have been granted.5 Consequently, in the period between 1989 and 1995 alone, 212(c) relief was granted to over 10,000 aliens.6~    ~    ~      9~      Three statutes enacted in recent years have reduced the size of the class of aliens eligible for such discretionary relief. In 1990, Congress amended 212(c) to preclude from discretionary relief anyone convicted of an aggravated felony who had served a term of imprisonment of at least five years. 511, 104 Stat. 5052 (amending 8 U.S.C.  1182(c)). In 1996, in 440(d) of AEDPA, Congress identified a broad set of offenses for which convictions would preclude such relief. See 110 Stat. 1277 (amending 8 U.S.C.  1182(c)).7 And finally, that same year, Congress passed IIRIRA. That statute, inter alia, repealed 212(c), see 304(b), 110 Stat. 3009-597, and replaced it with a new section that gives the Attorney General the authority to cancel removal for a narrow class of inadmissible or deportable aliens, see id., at 3009-594 (creating 8 U.S.C.  1229b). So narrowed, that class does not include anyone previously \"convicted of any aggravated felony.\" 1229b(a)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. V).~    ~    ~      10~      In the Attorney General's opinion, these amendments have entirely withdrawn his 212(c) authority to waive deportation for aliens previously convicted of aggravated felonies. Moreover, as a result of other amendments adopted in AEDPA and IIRIRA, the Attorney General also maintains that there is no judicial forum available to decide whether these statutes did, in fact, deprive him of the power to grant such relief. As we shall explain below, we disagree on both points. In our view, a federal court does have jurisdiction to decide the merits of the legal question, and the District Court and the Court of Appeals decided that question correctly in this case.~    ~    II~    ~      11~      The first question we must consider is whether the District Court retains jurisdiction under the general habeas corpus statute, 28 U.S.C.  2241 to entertain St. Cyr's challenge. His application for a writ raises a pure question of law. He does not dispute any of the facts that establish his deportability or the conclusion that he is deportable. Nor does he contend that he would have any right to have an unfavorable exercise of the Attorney General's discretion reviewed in a judicial forum. Rather, he contests the Attorney General's conclusion that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, he is not eligible for discretionary relief.~    ~    ~      12~      The District Court held, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that it had jurisdiction to answer that question in a habeas corpus proceeding.8 The INS argues, however, that four sections of the 1996 statutes specifically, 401(e) of AEDPA and three sections of IIRIRA (8 U.S.C.  1252(a)(1), 1252(a)(2)(C), and 1252(b)(9) (1994 ed., Supp. V)) stripped the courts of jurisdiction to decide the question of law presented by respondent's habeas corpus application.~    ~    ~      13~      For the INS to prevail it must overcome both the strong presumption in favor of judicial review of administrative action9 and the longstanding rule requiring a clear statement of congressional intent to repeal habeas jurisdiction. See Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wall. 85, 102 (1869) (\"We are not at liberty to except from [habeas corpus jurisdiction] any cases not plainly excepted by law\"); Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 660-661 (1996) (noting that \"[n]o provision of Title I mentions our authority to entertain original habeas petitions,\" and the statute \"makes no mention of our authority to hear habeas petitions filed as original matters in this Court\").10 Implications from statutory text or legislative history are not sufficient to repeal habeas jurisdiction; instead, Congress must articulate specific and unambiguous statutory directives to effect a repeal. Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wall., at 105 (\"Repeals by implication are not favored. They are seldom admitted except on the ground of repugnancy; and never, we think, when the former act can stand together with the new act\").11~    ~    ~      14~      In this case, the plain statement rule draws additional reinforcement from other canons of statutory construction. First, as a general matter, when a particular interpretation of a statute invokes the outer limits of Congress' power, we expect a clear indication that Congress intended that result. See Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building  Constr. Trades Council, 485 U.S. 568, 575 (1988). Second, if an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems, and where an alternative interpretation of the statute is \"fairly possible,\" see Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 62 (1932), we are obligated to construe the statute to avoid such problems. See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288, 341, 345-348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring); United States ex rel. Attorney General v. Delaware  Hudson Co., 213 U.S. 366, 408 (1909).12~    ~    ~      15~      A construction of the amendments at issue that would entirely preclude review of a pure question of law by any court would give rise to substantial constitutional questions. Article I, 9, cl. 2, of the Constitution provides: \"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\" Because of that Clause, some \"judicial intervention in deportation cases\" is unquestionably \"required by the Constitution.\" Heikkila v. Barber, 345 U.S. 229, 235 (1953).~    ~    ~      16~      Unlike the provisions of AEDPA that we construed in Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651 (1996), this case involves an alien subject to a federal removal order rather than a person confined pursuant to a state-court conviction. Accordingly, regardless of whether the protection of the Suspension Clause encompasses all cases covered by the 1867 Amendment extending the protection of the writ to state prisoners, cf. id., at 663-664, or by subsequent legal developments, see LaGuerre v. Reno, 164 F.3d 1035 (CA7 1998), at the absolute minimum, the Suspension Clause protects the writ \"as it existed in 1789.\"13 Felker, 518 U.S., at 663-664.~    ~    ~      17~      At its historical core, the writ of habeas corpus has served as a means of reviewing the legality of executive detention, and it is in that context that its protections have been strongest.14 See, e.g., Swain v. Pressley, 430 U.S. 372, 380, n. 13 (1977); id., at 385-386 (Burger, C. J., concurring) (noting that \"the traditional Great Writ was largely a remedy against executive detention\"); Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 533 (1953) (Jackson, J., concurring in result) (\"The historic purpose of the writ has been to relieve detention by executive authorities without judicial trial\"). In England prior to 1789, in the Colonies,15 and in this Nation during the formative years of our Government, the writ of habeas corpus was available to nonenemy aliens as well as to citizens.16 It enabled them to challenge executive and private detention in civil cases as well as criminal.17 Moreover, the issuance of the writ was not limited to challenges to the jurisdiction of the custodian, but encompassed detentions based on errors of law, including the erroneous application or interpretation of statutes.18 It was used to command the discharge of seamen who had a statutory exemption from impressment into the British Navy,19 to emancipate slaves,20 and to obtain the freedom of apprentices21 and asylum inmates.22 Most important, for our purposes, those early cases contain no suggestion that habeas relief in cases involving executive detention was only available for constitutional error.23~    ~    ~      18~      Notwithstanding the historical use of habeas corpus to remedy unlawful executive action, the INS argues that this case falls outside the traditional scope of the writ at common law. It acknowledges that the writ protected an individual who was held without legal authority, but argues that the writ would not issue where \"an official had statutory authorization to detain the individual but   the official was not properly exercising his discretionary power to determine whether the individual should be released.\" Brief for Respondent, O. T. 2000, No. 00-1011, p. 33. In this case, the INS points out, there is no dispute that the INS had authority in law to hold St. Cyr, as he is eligible for removal. St. Cyr counters that there is historical evidence of the writ issuing to redress the improper exercise of official discretion. See n. 23, supra; Hafetz, The Untold Story of Noncriminal Habeas Corpus and the 1996 Immigration Acts, 107 Yale L. J. 2509 (1998).~    ~    ~      19~      St. Cyr's constitutional position also finds some support in our prior immigration cases. In Heikkila v. Barber, the Court observed that the then-existing statutory immigration scheme \"had the effect of precluding judicial intervention in deportation cases except insofar as it was required by the Constitution,\" 345 U.S., at 234-235 (emphasis added) and that scheme, as discussed below, did allow for review on habeas of questions of law concerning an alien's eligibility for discretionary relief. Therefore, while the INS' historical arguments are not insubstantial, the ambiguities in the scope of the exercise of the writ at common law identified by St. Cyr, and the suggestions in this Court's prior decisions as to the extent to which habeas review could be limited consistent with the Constitution, convince us that the Suspension Clause questions that would be presented by the INS' reading of the immigration statutes before us are difficult and significant.24~    ~    ~      20~      In sum, even assuming that the Suspension Clause protects only the writ as it existed in 1789, there is substantial evidence to support the proposition that pure questions of law like the one raised by the respondent in this case could have been answered in 1789 by a common law judge with power to issue the writ of habeas corpus. It necessarily follows that a serious Suspension Clause issue would be presented if we were to accept the INS's submission that the 1996 statutes have withdrawn that power from federal judges and provided no adequate substitute for its exercise. See Hart, The Power of Congress to Limit the Jurisdiction of Federal Courts: An Exercise in Dialectic, 66 Harv. L. Rev. 1362, 1395-1397 (1953). The necessity of resolving such a serious and difficult constitutional issue and the desirability of avoiding that necessity simply reinforce the reasons for requiring a clear and unambiguous statement of constitutional intent.~    ~    ~      21~      Moreover, to conclude that the writ is no longer available in this context would represent a departure from historical practice in immigration law. The writ of habeas corpus has always been available to review the legality of executive detention. See Felker, 518 U.S., at 663; Swain v. Pressley, 430 U.S., at 380, n. 13; id., at 385-386 (Burger, C. J., concurring); Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S., at 533 (Jackson, J., concurring in result). Federal courts have been authorized to issue writs of habeas corpus since the enactment of the Judiciary Act of 1789, and 2241 of the Judicial Code provides that federal judges may grant the writ of habeas corpus on the application of a prisoner held \"in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\"25 28 U.S.C.  2241. Before and after the enactment in 1875 of the first statute regulating immigration, 18 Stat. 477, that jurisdiction was regularly invoked on behalf of noncitizens, particularly in the immigration context. See, e.g., In re Kaine, 14 How. 103 (1853); United States v. Jung Ah Lung, 124 U.S. 621, 626-632 (1888).~    ~    ~      22~      Until the enactment of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, the sole means by which an alien could test the legality of his or her deportation order was by bringing a habeas corpus action in district court.26 See, e.g., United States v. Jung Ah Lung, 124 U.S. 621 (1888); Heikkila, 345 U.S., at 235; Chin Yow v. United States, 208 U.S. 8 (1908); Ng Fung Ho v. White, 259 U.S. 276, 284 (1922). In such cases, other than the question whether there was some evidence to support the order,27 the courts generally did not review factual determinations made by the Executive. See Ekiu v. United States, 142 U.S. 651, 659 (1892). However, they did review the Executive's legal determinations. See Gegiow v. Uhl, 239 U.S. 3, 9 (1915) (\"The statute by enumerating the conditions upon which the allowance to land may be denied, prohibits the denial in other cases. And when the record shows that a commissioner of immigration is exceeding his power, the alien may demand his release upon habeas corpus\"); see also Neuman, Jurisdiction and the Rule of Law after the 1996 Immigration Act, 113 Harv. L. Rev. 1963, 1965-1969 (2000).28 In case after case, courts answered questions of law in habeas corpus proceedings brought by aliens challenging Executive interpretations of the immigration laws.29~    ~    ~      23~      Habeas courts also regularly answered questions of law that arose in the context of discretionary relief. See, e.g., United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260 (1954); United States ex rel. Hintopoulos v. Shaughnessy, 353 U.S. 72, 77 (1957).30 Traditionally, courts recognized a distinction between eligibility for discretionary relief, on the one hand, and the favorable exercise of discretion, on the other hand. See Neuman, 113 Harv. L. Rev., at 1991 (noting the \"strong tradition in habeas corpus law . . . that subjects the legally erroneous failure to exercise discretion, unlike a substantively unwise exercise of discretion, to inquiry on the writ\"). Eligibility that was \"governed by specific statutory standards\" provided \"a right to a ruling on an applicant's eligibility,\" even though the actual granting of relief was \"not a matter of right under any circumstances, but rather is in all cases a matter of grace.\" Jay v. Boyd, 351 U.S. 345, 353-354 (1956). Thus, even though the actual suspension of deportation authorized by 19(c) of the Immigration Act of 1917 was a matter of grace, in United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaugnessy, 347 U.S. 260 (1954), we held that a deportable alien had a right to challenge the Executive's failure to exercise the discretion authorized by the law. The exercise of the District Court's habeas corpus jurisdiction to answer a pure question of law in this case is entirely consistent with the exercise of such jurisdiction in Accardi. See also United States ex rel. Hintopoulos v. Shaughnessy, 353 U.S., at 77.~    ~    ~      24~      Thus, under the pre-1996 statutory scheme and consistent with its common-law antecedents it is clear that St. Cyr could have brought his challenge to the Board of Immigration Appeals' legal determination in a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S. C. 2241. The INS argues, however, that AEDPA and IIRIRA contain four provisions that express a clear and unambiguous statement of Congress' intent to bar petitions brought under 2241, despite the fact that none of them mention that section. The first of those provisions is AEDPA's 401(e).~    ~    ~      25~      While the title of 401(e) \"Elimination of Custody Review by Habeas Corpus\" would seem to support the INS' submission, the actual text of that provision does not.31 As we have previously noted, a title alone is not controlling. Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998) (\" '[T]he title of a statute . . . cannot limit the plain meaning of the text. For interpretive purposes [it is] of use only when [it] shed[s] light on some ambiguous word or phrase' \" (quoting Trainmen v. Baltimore  Ohio R. Co., 331 U.S. 519, 528-529 (1947))). The actual text of 401(e), unlike its title, merely repeals a subsection of the 1961 statute amending the judicial review provisions of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act. See n. 31, supra. Neither the title nor the text makes any mention of 28 U.S.C.  2241.~    ~    ~      26~      Under the 1952 Act, district courts had broad authority to grant declaratory and injunctive relief in immigration cases, including orders adjudicating deportability and those denying suspensions of deportability. See Foti v. INS, 375 U.S. 217, 225-226 (1963). The 1961 Act withdrew that jurisdiction from the district courts and provided that the procedures set forth in the Hobbs Act would be the \"sole and exclusive procedure\" for judicial review of final orders of deportation, subject to a series of exceptions. See 75 Stat. 651. The last of those exceptions stated that \"any alien held in custody pursuant to an order of deportation may obtain review thereof by habeas corpus proceedings.\" See id., at 652, codified at 8 U.S.C.  1105a(10) (repealed Sept. 30, 1996).~    ~    ~      27~      The INS argues that the inclusion of that exception in the 1961 Act indicates that Congress must have believed that it would otherwise have withdrawn the pre-existing habeas corpus jurisdiction in deportation cases, and that, as a result, the repeal of that exception in AEDPA in 1996 implicitly achieved that result. It seems to us, however, that the 1961 exception is best explained as merely confirming the limited scope of the new review procedures. In fact, the 1961 House Report provides that this section \"in no way disturbs the Habeas Corpus Act.\"32 H. R. Rep. No. 1086, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., 29 (1961). Moreover, a number of the courts that considered the interplay between the general habeas provision and INA 106(a)(10) after the 1961 Act and before the enactment of AEDPA did not read the 1961 Act's specific habeas provision as supplanting jurisdiction under 2241. Orozco v. INS, 911 F.2d 539, 541 (CA11 1990); United States ex rel. Marcello v. INS, 634 F.2d 964, 967 (CA5 1981); Sotelo Mondragon v. Ilchert, 653 F.2d 1254, 1255 (CA9 1980).~    ~    ~      28~      In any case, whether 106(a)(10) served as an independent grant of habeas jurisdiction or simply as an acknowledgement of continued jurisdiction pursuant to 2241, its repeal cannot be sufficient to eliminate what it did not originally grant namely, habeas jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S. C. 2241.(FN33 See Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wall., at 105-106 (concluding that the repeal of \"an additional grant of jurisdiction\" does not \"operate as a repeal of jurisdiction theretofore allowed\"); Ex parte McCardle, 7 Wall. 506, 515 (1869) (concluding that the repeal of portions of the 1867 statute conferring appellate jurisdiction on the Supreme Court in habeas proceedings did \"not affect the jurisdiction which was previously exercised\").~    ~    ~      29~      The INS also relies on three provisions of IIRIRA, now codified at 8 U.S.C.  1252(a)(1), 1252(a)(2)(C), and 1252(b)(9). As amended by 306 of IIRIRA, 8 U.S.C.  1252(a)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. V) now provides that, with certain exceptions, including those set out in subsection (b) of the same statutory provision, \"[j]udicial review of a final order of removal   is governed only by\" the Hobbs Act's procedures for review of agency orders in the courts of appeals. Similarly, 1252(b)(9), which addresses the \"[c]onsolidation of questions for judicial review,\" provides that \"[j]udicial review of all questions of law and fact, including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions, arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States under this subchapter shall be available only in judicial review of a final order under this section.\"34 Finally, 1252(a)(2)(C), which concerns \"[m]atters not subject to judicial review,\" states: \"Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed\" certain enumerated criminal offenses.~    ~    ~      30~      The term \"judicial review\" or \"jurisdiction to review\" is the focus of each of these three provisions. In the immigration context, \"judicial review\" and \"habeas corpus\" have historically distinct meanings. See Heikkila v. Barber, 345 U.S. 229 (1953). In Heikkila, the Court concluded that the finality provisions at issue \"preclud[ed] judicial review\" to the maximum extent possible under the Constitution, and thus concluded that the APA was inapplicable. Id., at 235. Nevertheless, the Court reaffirmed the right to habeas corpus. Ibid. Noting that the limited role played by the courts in habeas corpus proceedings was far narrower than the judicial review authorized by the APA, the Court concluded that \"it is the scope of inquiry on habeas corpus that differentiates\" habeas review from \"judicial review.\" Id., at 236; see also, e.g., Terlinden v. Ames, 184 U.S. 270, 278 (1902) (noting that under the extradition statute then in effect there was \"no right of review to be exercised by any court or judicial officer,\" but that limited review on habeas was nevertheless available); Ekiu, 142 U.S., at 663 (observing that while a decision to exclude an alien was subject to inquiry on habeas, it could not be \"impeached or reviewed\"). Both 1252(a)(1) and (a)(2)(C) speak of \"judicial review\" that is, full, nonhabeas review. Neither explicitly mentions habeas,35 or 28 U.S.C.  2241.36 Accordingly, neither provision speaks with sufficient clarity to bar jurisdiction pursuant to the general habeas statute.~    ~    ~      31~      The INS also makes a separate argument based on 8 U.S.C.  1252(b)(9) (1994 ed., Supp. V). We have previously described 1252(b)(9) as a \"zipper clause.\" Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, 525 U.S. 471, 483 (1999). Its purpose is to consolidate \"judicial review\" of immigration proceedings into one action in the court of appeals, but it applies only \"[w]ith respect to review of an order of removal under subsection (a)(1).\" 8 U.S.C.  1252(b) (1994 ed., Supp. V).37 Accordingly, this provision, by its own terms, does not bar habeas jurisdiction over removal orders not subject to judicial review under 1252(a)(1) including orders against aliens who are removable by reason of having committed one or more criminal offenses. Subsection (b)(9) simply provides for the consolidation of issues to be brought in petitions for \"[j]udicial review,\" which, as we note above, is a term historically distinct from habeas. See Mahadeo v. Reno, 226 F.3d 3, 12 (CA1 2000); Flores-Miramontes v. INS, 212 F.3d 1133, 1140 (CA9 2000). It follows that 1252(b)(9) does not clearly apply to actions brought pursuant to the general habeas statute, and thus cannot repeal that statute either in part or in whole.~    ~    ~      32~      If it were clear that the question of law could be answered in another judicial forum, it might be permissible to accept the INS' reading of 1252. But the absence of such a forum, coupled with the lack of a clear, unambiguous, and express statement of congressional intent to preclude judicial consideration on habeas of such an important question of law, strongly counsels against adopting a construction that would raise serious constitutional questions.38 Cf. Felker, 518 U.S., at 660-661. Accordingly, we conclude that habeas jurisdiction under 2241 was not repealed by AEDPA and IIRIRA.~    ~    III~    ~      33~      The absence of a clearly expressed statement of congressional intent also pervades our review of the merits of St. Cyr's claim. Two important legal consequences ensued from respondent's entry of a guilty plea in March 1996: (1) He became subject to deportation, and (2) he became eligible for a discretionary waiver of that deportation under the prevailing interpretation of 212(c). When IIRIRA went into effect in April 1997, the first consequence was unchanged except for the fact that the term \"removal\" was substituted for \"deportation.\" The issue that remains to be resolved is whether IIRIRA 304(b) changed the second consequence by eliminating respondent's eligibility for a waiver.~    ~    ~      34~      The INS submits that the statute resolves the issue because it unambiguously communicates Congress' intent to apply the provisions of IIRIRA's Title III-A to all removals initiated after the effective date of the statute, and, in any event, its provisions only operate prospectively and not retrospectively. The Court of Appeals, relying primarily on the analysis in our opinion in Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244 (1994), held, contrary to the INS' arguments, that Congress' intentions concerning the application of the \"Cancellation of Removal\" procedure are ambiguous and that the statute imposes an impermissible retroactive effect on aliens who, in reliance on the possibility of 212(c) relief, pled guilty to aggravated felonies. See 229 F.3d, at 416, 420. We agree.~    ~    ~      35~      Retroactive statutes raise special concerns. See Landgraf, 511 U.S., at 266. \"The Legislature's unmatched powers allow it to sweep away settled expectations suddenly and without individualized consideration. Its responsivity to political pressures poses a risk that it may be tempted to use retroactive legislation as a means of retribution against unpopular groups or individuals.\"39 Ibid. Accordingly, \"congressional enactments   will not be construed to have retroactive effect unless their language requires this result.\" Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U.S. 204, 208 (1988).~    ~    ~      36~      \"[This] presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence, and embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our Republic. Elementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should have an opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly; settled expectations should not be lightly disrupted. For that reason, the 'principle that the legal effect of conduct should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the conduct took place has timeless and universal human appeal.' Kaiser, 494 U.S., at 855 (Scalia, J., concurring). In a free, dynamic society, creativity in both commercial and artistic endeavors is fostered by a rule of law that gives people confidence about the legal consequences of their actions.\" Landgraf, 511 U.S., at 265-266 (footnote omitted).~    ~    ~      37~      Despite the dangers inherent in retroactive legislation, it is beyond dispute that, within constitutional limits, Congress has the power to enact laws with retrospective effect. See id., at 268. A statute may not be applied retroactively, however, absent a clear indication from Congress that it intended such a result. \"Requiring clear intent assures that Congress itself has affirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive application and determined that it is an acceptable price to pay for the countervailing benefits.\" Id., at 272-273. Accordingly, the first step in determining whether a statute has an impermissible retroactive effect is to ascertain whether Congress has directed with the requisite clarity that the law be applied retrospectively. Martin v. Hadix, 527 U.S. 343, 352 (1999).~    ~    ~      38~      The standard for finding such unambiguous direction is a demanding one. \"[C]ases where this Court has found truly 'retroactive' effect adequately authorized by statute have involved statutory language that was so clear that it could sustain only one interpretation.\" Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320, 328, n. 4 (1997). The INS makes several arguments in favor of its position that IIRIRA achieves this high level of clarity.~    ~    ~      39~      First, the INS points to the comprehensive nature of IIRIRA's revision of federal immigration law. \"Congress's comprehensive establishment of a new immigration framework,\" the INS argues, \"shows its intent that, after a transition period, the provisions of the old law should no longer be applied at all.\" Brief for Petitioner 33-34. We rejected a similar argument, however, in Landgraf, a case that, like this one, involved Congress' comprehensive revision of an important federal statute. 511 U.S., at 260-261. By itself, the comprehensiveness of a congressional enactment says nothing about Congress' intentions with respect to the retroactivity of the enactment's individual provisions.40~    ~    ~      40~      The INS also points to the effective date for Title III-A as providing a clear statement of congressional intent to apply IIRIRA's repeal of 212(c) retroactively. See IIRIRA 309(a). But the mere promulgation of an effective date for a statute does not provide sufficient assurance that Congress specifically considered the potential unfairness that retroactive application would produce. For that reason, a \"statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.\" Landgraf, 511 U.S., at 257.~    ~    ~      41~      The INS further argues that any ambiguity in Congress' intent is wiped away by the \"saving provision\" in IIRIRA 309(c)(1). Brief for Petitioner 34-36. That provision states that, for aliens whose exclusion or deportation proceedings began prior to the Title III-A effective date, \"the amendments made by [Title III-A] shall not apply, and   the proceedings (including judicial review thereof) shall continue to be conducted without regard to such amendments.\"41 This rule, however, does not communicate with unmistakable clarity Congress' intention to apply its repeal of 212(c) retroactively. Nothing in either 309(c)(1) or the statute's legislative history even discusses the effect of the statute on proceedings based on pre-IIRIRA convictions that are commenced after its effective date.42 Section 309(c)(1) is best read as merely setting out the procedural rules to be applied to removal proceedings pending on the effective date of the statute. Because \"[c]hanges in procedural rules may often be applied in suits arising before their enactment without raising concerns about retroactivity,\" Landgraf, 511 U.S., at 275, it was necessary for Congress to identify which set of procedures would apply in those circumstances. As the Conference Report expressly explained, \"[Section 309(c)] provides for the transition to new procedures in the case of an alien already in exclusion or deportation proceedings on the effective date.\" H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-828, p. 222 (1996) (emphasis added).~    ~    ~      42~      Another reason for declining to accept the INS' invitation to read 309(c)(1) as dictating the temporal reach of IIRIRA 304(b) is provided by Congress' willingness, in other sections of IIRIRA, to indicate unambiguously its intention to apply specific provisions retroactively. IIRIRA's amendment of the definition of \"aggravated felony,\" for example, clearly states that it applies with respect to \"conviction[s]   entered before, on, or after\" the statute's enactment date. 321(b).43 As the Court of Appeals noted, the fact that Congress made some provisions of IIRIRA expressly applicable to prior convictions, but did not do so in regard to 304(b), is an indication \"that Congress did not definitively decide the issue of 304(b)'s retroactive application to pre-enactment convictions.\" See 229 F.3d, at 415. The \"saving provision\" is therefore no more significant than the specification of an effective date.~    ~    ~      43~      The presumption against retroactive application of ambiguous statutory provisions, buttressed by \"the longstanding principle of construing any lingering ambiguities in deportation statutes in favor of the alien,\" INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 449 (1987), forecloses the conclusion that, in enacting 304(b), \"Congress itself has affirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive application and determined that it is an acceptable price to pay for the countervailing benefits.\"44 Landgraf, 511 U.S., at 272-273. We therefore proceed to the second step of Landgraf's retroactivity analysis in order to determine whether depriving removable aliens of consideration for 212(c) relief produces an impermissible retroactive effect for aliens who, like respondent, were convicted pursuant to a plea agreement at a time when their plea would not have rendered them ineligible for 212(c) relief.45~    ~    ~      44~      \"The inquiry into whether a statute operates retroactively demands a commonsense, functional judgment about 'whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment.' \" Martin, 527 U.S., at 357-358 (quoting Landgraf, 511 U.S., at 270). A statute has retroactive effect when it \" 'takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability, in respect to transactions or considerations already past . . . .' \"46 Landgraf, 511 U.S., at 269 (quoting Society for Propagation of the Gospel v. Wheeler, 22 F. Cas. 756, 767 (No. 13,156) (CCNH 1814) (Story, J.)). As we have repeatedly counseled, the judgment whether a particular statute acts retroactively \"should be informed and guided by 'familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations.' \" Martin, 527 U.S., at 358 (quoting Landgraf, 511 U.S., at 270).~    ~    ~      45~      IIRIRA's elimination of any possibility of 212(c) relief for people who entered into plea agreements with the expectation that they would be eligible for such relief clearly \" 'attaches a new disability, in respect to transactions or considerations already past.' \" Landgraf, 511 U.S., at 269. Plea agreements involve a quid pro quo between a criminal defendant and the government. See Newton v. Rumery, 480 U.S. 386, 393, n. 3 (1987). In exchange for some perceived benefit, defendants waive several of their constitutional rights (including the right to a trial) and grant the government numerous \"tangible benefits, such as promptly imposed punishment without the expenditure of prosecutorial resources.\"47 Ibid. There can be little doubt that, as a general matter, alien defendants considering whether to enter into a plea agreement are acutely aware of the immigration consequences of their convictions.48 See Magana-Pizano v. INS, 200 F.3d 603, 612 (CA9 1999) (\"That an alien charged with a crime   would factor the immigration consequences of conviction in deciding whether to plead or proceed to trial is well-documented.\"); see also 3 Bender, Criminal Defense Techniques 60A.01, 60A.02[2] (1999) (\"Preserving the client's right to remain in the United States may be more important to the client than any potential jail sentence\"). Given the frequency with which 212(c) relief was granted in the years leading up to AEDPA and IIRIRA,49 preserving the possibility of such relief would have been one of the principal benefits sought by defendants deciding whether to accept a plea offer or instead to proceed to trial.50~    ~    ~      46~      The case of Charles Jideonwo, a petitioner in a parallel litigation in the Seventh Circuit, is instructive. Charged in 1994 with violating federal narcotics law, Jideonwo entered into extensive plea negotiations with the government, the sole purpose of which was to ensure that \" 'he got less than five years to avoid what would have been a statutory bar on 212(c) relief.' \" Jideonwo v. INS, 224 F.3d 692, 699 (CA7 2000) (quoting the Immigration Judge's findings of fact). The potential for unfairness in the retroactive application of IIRIRA 304(b) to people like Jideonwo and St. Cyr is significant and manifest. Relying upon settled practice, the advice of counsel, and perhaps even assurances in open court that the entry of the plea would not foreclose 212(c) relief, a great number of defendants in Jideonwo's and St. Cyr's position agreed to plead guilty.51 Now that prosecutors have received the benefit of these plea agreements, agreements that were likely facilitated by the aliens' belief in their continued eligibility for 212(c) relief, it would surely be contrary to \"familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations,\" Landgraf, 511 U.S., at 270, to hold that IIRIRA's subsequent restrictions deprive them of any possibility of such relief.52~    ~    ~      47~      The INS argues that deportation proceedings (and the Attorney General's discretionary power to grant relief from deportation) are \"inherently prospective\" and that, as a result, application of the law of deportation can never have a retroactive effect. Such categorical arguments are not particularly helpful in undertaking Landgraf's commonsense, functional retroactivity analysis. See Martin, 527 U.S., at 359. Moreover, although we have characterized deportation as \"look[ing] prospectively to the respondent's right to remain in this country in the future,\" INS v. Lopeznbhyph;Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1038 (1984), we have done so in order to reject the argument that deportation is punishment for past behavior and that deportation proceedings are therefore subject to the \"various protections that apply in the context of a criminal trial.\" Ibid. As our cases make clear, the presumption against retroactivity applies far beyond the confines of the criminal law. See Landgraf, 511 U.S., at 272. And our mere statement that deportation is not punishment for past crimes does not mean that we cannot consider an alien's reasonable reliance on the continued availability of discretionary relief from deportation when deciding whether the elimination of such relief has a retroactive effect.53~    ~    ~      48~      Finally, the fact that 212(c) relief is discretionary does not affect the propriety of our conclusion. There is a clear difference, for the purposes of retroactivity analysis, between facing possible deportation and facing certain deportation. Cf. Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Schumer, 520 U.S. 939, 949 (1997) (an increased likelihood of facing a qui tam action constitutes an impermissible retroactive effect for the defendant); Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U.S. 397, 401 (1937) (\"Removal of the possibility of a sentence of less than fifteen years   operates to [defendants'] detriment\" (emphasis added)). Prior to AEDPA and IIRIRA, aliens like St. Cyr had a significant likelihood of receiving 212(c) relief.54 Because respondent, and other aliens like him, almost certainly relied upon that likelihood in deciding whether to forgo their right to a trial, the elimination of any possibility of 212(c) relief by IIRIRA has an obvious and severe retroactive effect.55~    ~    ~      49~      We find nothing in IIRIRA unmistakably indicating that Congress considered the question whether to apply its repeal of 212(c) retroactively to such aliens. We therefore hold that 212(c) relief remains available for aliens, like respondent, whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who, notwithstanding those convictions, would have been eligible for 212(c) relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.~    ~    ~      50~      The judgment is affirmed.~    ~    ~      51~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      52~      O'Connor, J., filed a dissenting opinion.~    ~    ~      53~      Scalia, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and Thomas, J., joined, and in which O'Connor, J., joined, as to Parts I and III.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~          See Mahadeo v.

Reno, 180 F.3d 1311 (CA11 1999).~      ~      ~        2~          The INS was subsequently transferred to the Department of Justice. See Matter of L, 1 I.  N. Dec., at 2, n. 1. As a result, the powers previously delegated to the Secretary of Labor were transferred to the Attorney General. See id., at 2.~      ~      ~        3~         The exercise of discretion was deemed a nunc pro tunc correction of the record of reentry. In approving of this construction, the Attorney General concluded that strictly limiting the seventh exception to exclusion proceedings would be \"capricious and whimsical.\" Id., at 5.~      ~      ~        4~          See 8 U.S.C.  1101(a)(43) (1994 ed. and Supp. V). While the term has always been defined expansively, it was broadened substantially by IIRIRA. For example, as amended by that statute, the term includes all convictions for theft or burglary for which a term of imprisonment of at least one year is imposed (as opposed to five years pre-IIRIRA), compare 1101(a)(43)(G) (1994 ed., Supp. V) with 1101(a)(43)(G) (1994 ed.), and all convictions involving fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim exceeds $10,000 (as opposed to $200,000 pre-IIRIRA), compare 1101(a)(43)(M)(i) (1994 ed., Supp. V) with 1101(a)(43)(M)(i) (1994 ed.). In addition, the term includes any \"crime of violence\" resulting in a prison sentence of at least one year (as opposed to five years pre-IIRIRA), compare 8 U.S.C.  1101(a)(43)(F) (1994 ed., Supp. V) with 1101(a)(43)(F) (1994 ed.), and that phrase is itself broadly defined. See 18 U.S.C.  16 (\"[A]n offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,\" or \"any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense\").~      ~      ~        5~          See, e.g., Rannik, The Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996: A Death Sentence for the 212(c) Waiver, 28 Miami Inter-Am. L. Rev. 123, 150, n. 80 (providing statistics indicating that 51.5% of the applications for which a final decision was reached between 1989 and 1995 were granted); see also Mattis v. Reno, 212 F.3d 31, 33 (CA1 2000) (\"[I]n the years immediately preceding the statute's passage, over half the applications were granted\"); Tasios, 204 F.3d, at 551 (same).     In developing these changes, the Board developed criteria, comparable to common-law rules, for deciding when deportation is appropriate. Those criteria, which have been set forth in several Board opinions, see, e.g., Matter of Marin, 16 I.  N. Dec. 581 (1978), include the seriousness of the offense, evidence of either rehabilitation or recidivism, the duration of the alien's residence, the impact of deportation on the family, the number of citizens in the family, and the character of any service in the Armed Forces.~      ~      ~        6~         See Rannik, at 150, n. 80. However, based on these statistics, one cannot form a reliable estimate of the number of individuals who will be affected by today's decision. Since the 1996 statutes expanded the definition of \"aggravated felony\" substantially and retroactively the number of individuals now subject to deportation absent 212(c) relief is significantly higher than these figures would suggest. In addition, the nature of the changes (bringing under the definition more minor crimes which may have been committed many years ago) suggests that an increased percentage of applicants will meet the stated criteria for 212(c) relief.~      ~      ~        7~          The new provision barred review for individuals ordered deported because of a conviction for an aggravated felony, for a drug conviction, for certain weapons or national security violations, and for multiple convictions involving crimes of moral turpitude.

The dissent, however, relies on Chalacombe's Case as its sole support for the proposition that courts treated executive discretion as \"lying entirely beyond the judicial ken.\" See post, at 18.

The case ultimately became moot when the Admiralty discharged Chalacombe, but it is significant that, despite some initial hesitation, the court decided to proceed.~      ~      ~        24~          The dissent reads into Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75 (1807), support for a proposition that the Chief Justice did not endorse, either explicitly or implicitly. See post, at 14-15. He did note that \"the first congress of the United States\" acted under \"the immediate influence\" of the injunction provided by the Suspension Clause when it gave \"life and activity\" to \"this great constitutional privilege\" in the Judiciary Act of 1789, and that the writ could not be suspended until after the statute was enacted. 4 Cranch, at 95. That statement, however, surely does not imply that Marshall believed the Framers had drafted a Clause that would proscribe a temporary abrogation of the writ, while permitting its permanent suspension. Indeed, Marshall's comment expresses the far more sensible view that the Clause was intended to preclude any possibility that \"the privilege itself would be lost\" by either the inaction or the action of Congress. See, e.g., ibid. (noting that the Founders \"must have felt, with peculiar force, the obligation\" imposed by the Suspension Clause).~      ~      ~        25~          In fact, 2241 descends directly from 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 and the 1867 Act. See Act of Sept. 24, 1789, ch. 20, 14, 1 Stat. 82; Act of Feb. 5, 1867, ch. 28, 14 Stat. 385. Its text remained undisturbed by either AEDPA or IIRIRA.~      ~      ~        26~          After 1952, judicial review of deportation orders could also be obtained by declaratory judgment actions brought in federal district court. Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, 349 U.S. 48 (1955). However, in 1961, Congress acted to consolidate review in the courts of appeals. See Foti v.

See, e.g., United States ex rel. Devenuto v. Curran, 299 F. 206 (CA2 1924); Hee Fuk Yuen v. White, 273 F. 10 (CA9 1921); United States ex rel. Patti v. Curran, 22 F.2d 314 (SDNY 1926); Gabriel v. Johnson, 29 F.2d 347 (CA1 1928). During the same period, habeas was also used to review legal questions that arose in the context of the Government's exercise of other forms of discretionary relief under the 1917 Act. See, e.g., United States ex rel. Adel v. Shaughnessy, 183 F.2d 371 (CA2 1950); United States ex rel. Kaloudis v. Shaughnessy, 180 F.2d 489 (CA2 1950); Mastrapasqua v.

Curran, 13 F.2d 96 (CA3 1926).~      ~      ~        31~          The section reads as follows: \"(e) Elimination of Custody Review by Habeas Corpus. Section 106(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1105a(a)) is amended      \"(1) in paragraph (8), by adding 'and' at the end;     \"(2) in paragraph (9), by striking '; and' at the end and inserting a period; and     \"(3) by striking paragraph (10).\" 110 Stat. 1268.~      ~      ~        32~          Moreover, the focus of the 1961 amendments appears to have been the elimination of Administrative Procedure Act (APA) suits that were brought in the district court and that sought declaratory relief. See, e.g., H. R. No. 2478, 85th Cong., 2d Sess., 9 (1958) (\"[H]abeas corpus is a far more expeditious judicial remedy than that of declaratory judgment\"); 104 Cong. Rec. 17173 (1958) (statement of Rep. Walter) (stating that courts would be \"relieved of a great burden\" once declaratory actions were eliminated and noting that habeas corpus was an \"expeditious\" means of review).~      ~      ~        33~          As the INS acknowledges, the overwhelming majority of Circuit Courts concluded that district courts retained habeas jurisdiction under 2241 after AEDPA. See Goncalves v. Reno, 144 F.3d 110 (CA1 1998); Henderson v. INS, 157 F.3d 106 (CA2 1998); Sandoval v. Reno, 166 F.3d 225 (CA3 1999); Bowrin v. INS, 194 F.3d 483 (CA4 1999); Requena-Rodriguez v.

Greene, 190 F.3d 1135 (CA10 1999); Mayers v. INS, 175 F.3d 1289 (CA11 1999). But see LaGuerre v. Reno, 164 F.3d 1035 (CA7 1998).~      ~      ~        34~          8 U.S.C.  1252(g) (1994 ed., Supp. V), entitled \"Exclusive jurisdiction,\" is not relevant to our analysis of the jurisdictional issue. In Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471 (1991) (AADC), we explained that that provision applied only to three types of discretionary decisions by the Attorney General specifically, to commence proceedings, to adjudicate cases, or to execute removal orders none of which are at issue here.~      ~      ~        35~          Contrary to the dissent, see post, at 4, we do not think, given the longstanding distinction between \"judicial review\" and \"habeas,\" that 1252(e)(2)'s mention of habeas in the subsection governing \"[j]udicial review of orders under section 1225(b)(1)\" is sufficient to establish that Congress intended to abrogate the historical distinction between two terms of art in the immigration context when enacting IIRIRA.     \"[W]here Congress borrows terms of art in which are accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of centuries of practice, it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in the body of learning from which it was taken and the meaning its use will convey to the judicial mind unless otherwise instructed. In such case, absence of contrary direction may be taken as satisfaction with widely accepted definitions, not as a departure from them.\" Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 263 (1952). At most, 1252(e)(2) introduces additional statutory ambiguity, but ambiguity does not help the INS in this case. As we noted above, only the clearest statement of congressional intent will support the INS' position. See supra, at 14.~      ~      ~        36~          It is worth noting that in enacting the provisions of AEDPA and IIRIRA that restricted or altered judicial review, Congress did refer specifically to several different sources of jurisdiction. See, e.g., 381, 110 Stat. 3009-650 (adding to grant of jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C.  1329 (1994 ed., Supp. V) a provision barring jurisdiction under that provision for suits against the United States or its officers or agents). Section 401(e), which eliminated supplemental habeas jurisdiction under the INA, expressly strikes paragraph 10 of 106(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, not 28 U.S.C.  2241. Similarly, 306 of IIRIRA, which enacted the new INA 242, specifically precludes reliance on the provisions of the APA providing for the taking of additional evidence, and imposes specific limits on the availability of declaratory relief. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C.  1535(e)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. V) (explicitly barring aliens detained under \"alien terrorist removal\" procedures from seeking \"judicial review, including application for a writ of habeas corpus, except for a claim by the alien that continued detention violates the alien's rights under the Constitution\"). At no point, however, does IIRIRA make express reference to 2241. Given the historic use of 2241 jurisdiction as a means of reviewing deportation and exclusion orders, Congress' failure to refer specifically to 2241 is particularly significant. Cf. Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U.S. 380, 396, n. 23 (1991).~      ~      ~        37~          As we noted in AADC, courts construed the 1961 amendments as channeling review of final orders to the courts of appeals, but still permitting district courts to exercise their traditional jurisdiction over claims that were viewed as being outside of a \"final order.\" 525 U.S., at 485. Read in light of this history, 1252(b)(9) ensures that review of those types of claims will now be consolidated in a petition for review and considered by the courts of appeals.~      ~      ~        38~          The dissent argues that our decision will afford more rights to criminal aliens than to noncriminal aliens. However, as we have noted, the scope of review on habeas is considerably more limited than on APA-style review. Moreover, this case raises only a pure question of law as to respondent's statutory eligibility for discretionary relief, not, as the dissent suggests, an objection to the manner in which discretion was exercised. As to the question of timing and congruent means of review, we note that Congress could, without raising any constitutional questions, provide an adequate substitute through the courts of appeals. See, e.g., Swain v. Pressley, 430 U.S. 372, 381 (1977) (\"[T]he substitution of a collateral remedy which is neither inadequate nor ineffective to test the legality of a person's detention\" does not violate the Suspension Clause).~      ~      ~        39~          The INS appears skeptical of the notion that immigrants might be considered an \" 'unpopular group.' \" See Brief for Petitioner 15, n. 8. But see Legomsky, Fear and Loathing in Congress and the Courts: Immigration and Judicial Review, 78 Texas L. Rev. 1615, 1626 (2000) (observing that, because noncitizens cannot vote, they are particularly vulnerable to adverse legislation).~      ~      ~        40~          The INS' argument that refusing to apply 304(b) retroactively creates an unrecognizable hybrid of old and new is, for the same reason, unconvincing.~      ~      ~        41~          \"(c) Transition For Aliens In Proceedings.  \"(1) General Rule That New Rules Do Not Apply. Subject to the succeeding provisions of this subsection, in the case of an alien who is in exclusion or deportation proceedings as of the title III A effective date      \"(A) the amendments made by this subtitle shall not apply, and     \"(B) the proceedings (including judicial review thereof) shall continue to be conducted without regard to such amendments.\" 309, 101 Stat. 3009-626.~      ~      ~        42~          The INS' reliance, see Reply Brief for Petitioner 12, on INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 420 (1999), is beside the point because that decision simply observed that the new rules would not apply to a proceeding filed before IIRIRA's effective date.~      ~      ~        43~          See also IIRIRA 321(c) (\"The amendments made by this section shall apply to actions taken on or after the date of the enactment of this Act, regardless of when the conviction occurred  \"); 322(c) (\"The amendments made by subsection (a) shall apply to convictions and sentences entered before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this Act\"); 342(b) (the amendment adding incitement of terrorist activity as a ground for exclusion \"shall apply to incitement regardless of when it occurs\"); 344(c) (the amendment adding false claims of U.S. citizenship as ground for removal \"shall apply to representations made on or after the date\" of enactment); 347(c) (amendments rendering alien excludable or deportable any alien who votes unlawfully \"shall apply to voting occurring before, on, or after the date\" of enactment); 348(b) (amendment providing for automatic denial of discretionary waiver from exclusion \"shall be effective on the date of the enactment   and shall apply in the case of any alien who is in exclusion or deportation proceedings as of such date unless a final administrative order in such proceedings has been entered as of such date\"); 350(b) (amendment adding domestic violence and stalking as grounds for deportation \"shall apply to convictions, or violations of court orders, occurring after the date\" of enactment); 351(c) (discussing deportation for smuggling and providing that amendments \"shall apply to applications for waivers filed before, on, or after the date\" of enactment); 352(b) (amendments adding renouncement of citizenship to avoid taxation as a ground for exclusion \"shall apply to individuals who renounce United States citizenship on or after the date\" of enactment); 380(c) (amendment imposing civil penalties on aliens for failure to depart \"shall apply to actions occurring on or after\" effective date); 384(d)(2) (amendments adding penalties for disclosure of information shall apply to \"offenses occurring on or after the date\" of enactment); 531(b) (public charge considerations as a ground for exclusion \"shall apply to applications submitted on or after such date\"); 604(c) (new asylum provision \"shall apply to applications for asylum filed on or after the first day of the first month beginning more than 180 days after the date\" of enactment). The INS argues that the Title III-B amendments containing such express temporal provisions are unrelated to the subject matter of 304(b). Brief for Petitioner 37-38. But it is clear that provisions such as IIRIRA 321(b), which addresses IIRIRA's redefinition of \"aggravated felony,\" deal with subjects quite closely related to 304(b)'s elimination of 212(c) relief for aliens convicted of aggravated felonies.~      ~      ~        44~          The legislative history is significant because, despite its comprehensive character, it contains no evidence that Congress specifically considered the question of the applicability of IIRIRA 304(b) to pre-IIRIRA convictions. Cf. Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., 446 U.S. 578, 602 (1980) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (\"In a case where the construction of legislative language such as this makes so sweeping and so relatively unorthodox a change as that made here, I think judges as well as detectives may take into consideration the fact that a watchdog did not bark in the night\"), cited in Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U.S. 380, 396, n. 23. (1991) (citing A. Doyle, Silver Blaze, in The Complete Sherlock Holmes 335 (1927)).~      ~      ~        45~          The INS argues that we should extend deference under Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), to the BIA's interpretation of IIRIRA as applying to all deportation proceedings initiated after IIRIRA's effective date. We only defer, however, to agency interpretations of statutes that, applying the normal \"tools of statutory construction,\" are ambiguous. Id., at 843, n. 9; INS v. Cardozanbhyph;Fonseca, 480 U.S., at 447-448. Because a statute that is ambiguous with respect to retroactive application is construed under our precedent to be unambiguously prospective, Landgraf, 511 U.S., at 264, there is, for Chevron purposes, no ambiguity in such a statute for an agency to resolve.~      ~      ~        46~          As we noted in Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Schumer, 520 U.S. 939 (1997), this language by Justice Story \"does not purport to define the outer limit of impermissible retroactivity.\" Id., at 947. Instead, it simply describes several \"sufficient,\" as opposed to \"necessary,\" conditions for finding retroactivity.

See In re Soriano, 16 Immig. Rptr. B1-227, B1-238 to B1-239 (BIA 1996) (Lory D. Rosenberg, Board Member, concurring and dissenting) (\"I find compelling policy and practical reasons to go beyond such a limited interpretation as the one the majority proposes in this case. All of these people, and no doubt many others, had settled expectations to which they conformed their conduct\").~      ~      ~        53~          We are equally unconvinced by the INS' comparison of the elimination of 212(c) relief for people like St. Cyr with the Clayton Act's elimination of federal courts' power to enjoin peaceful labor actions. In American Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trades Council, 257 U.S. 184 (1921), and Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, 254 U.S. 443, 464 (1921), we applied the Clayton Act's limitations on injunctive relief to cases pending at the time of the statute's passage. But unlike the elimination of 212(c) relief in this case, which depends upon an alien's decision to plead guilty to an \"aggravated felony,\" the deprivation of the District Court's power to grant injunctive relief at issue in Duplex Printing did not in any way result from or depend on the past action of the party seeking the injunction. Thus, it could not plausibly have been argued that the Clayton Act attached a \" 'new disability, in respect to transactions or considerations already past.' \" Landgraf, 511 U.S., at 269.~      ~      ~        54~          See n. 5, supra.~      ~      ~        55~          The INS cites several cases affirming Congress' power to retroactively unsettle such expectations in the immigration context. See Brief for Petitioner 40-41, and n. 21. But our recognition that Congress has the power to act retrospectively in the immigration context sheds no light on the question at issue at this stage of the Landgraf analysis: whether a particular statute in fact has such a retroactive effect. Moreover, our decision today is fully consistent with a recognition of Congress' power to act retrospectively. We simply assert, as we have consistently done in the past, that in legislating retroactively, Congress must make its intention plain. Similarly, the fact that Congress has the power to alter the rights of resident aliens to remain in the United States is not determinative of the question whether a particular statute has a retroactive effect. See Chew Heong v. United States, 112 U.S. 536 (1884). Applying a statute barring Chinese nationals from reentering the country without a certificate prepared when they left to people who exited the country before the statute went into effect would have retroactively unsettled their reliance on the state of the law when they departed. See id., at 559. So too, applying IIRIRA 304(b) to aliens who pled guilty or nolo contendere to crimes on the understanding that, in so doing, they would retain the ability to seek discretionary 212(c) relief would retroactively unsettle their reliance on the state of the law at the time of their plea agreement.~      ~    ~    ~      54~      Justice O'Connor, dissenting.~    ~    ~      55~      I join Parts I and III of Justice Scalia's dissenting opinion in this case. I do not join Part II because I believe that, assuming, arguendo, that the Suspension Clause guarantees some minimum extent of habeas review, the right asserted by the alien in this case falls outside the scope of that review for the reasons explained by Justice Scalia in Part II-B of his dissenting opinion. The question whether the Suspension Clause assures habeas jurisdiction in this particular case properly is resolved on this ground alone, and there is no need to say more.~    ~    ~      56~      Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Thomas join, and with whom Justice O'Connor joins as to Parts I and III, dissenting.~    ~    ~      57~      The Court today finds ambiguity in the utterly clear language of a statute that forbids the district court (and all other courts) to entertain the claims of aliens such as respondent St. Cyr, who have been found deportable by reason of their criminal acts. It fabricates a superclear statement, \"magic words\" requirement for the congressional expression of such an intent, unjustified in law and unparalleled in any other area of our jurisprudence. And as the fruit of its labors, it brings forth a version of the statute that affords criminal aliens more opportunities for delay-inducing judicial review than are afforded to non-criminal aliens, or even than were afforded to criminal aliens prior to this legislation concededly designed to expedite their removal. Because it is clear that the law deprives us of jurisdiction to entertain this suit, I respectfully dissent.~    ~    ~      58~      * In categorical terms that admit of no exception, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), 110 Stat. 3009-546, unambiguously repeals the application of 28 U.S.C.  2241 (the general habeas corpus provision), and of all other provisions for judicial review, to deportation challenges brought by certain kinds of criminal aliens. This would have been readily apparent to the reader, had the Court at the outset of its opinion set forth the relevant provisions of IIRIRA and of its statutory predecessor, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214. I will begin by supplying that deficiency, and explaining IIRIRA's jurisdictional scheme. It begins with what we have called a channeling or \" 'zipper' clause,\" Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 483 (1999) namely, 8 U.S.C.  1252(b)(9) (1994 ed., Supp. V). This provision, entitled \"Consolidation of questions for judicial review,\" provides as follows:~    ~    ~      59~      \"Judicial review of all questions of law and fact, including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions, arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States under this subchapter shall be available only in judicial review of a final order under this section.\" (Emphases added.)~    ~    ~      60~      In other words, if any review is available of any \"questio[n] of law   arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States under this subchapter,\" it is available \"only in judicial review of a final order under this section [1252].\" What kind of review does that section provide? That is set forth in 1252(a)(1), which states:~    ~    ~      61~      \"Judicial review of a final order of removal (other than an order of removal without a hearing pursuant to [the expedited-removal provisions for undocumented aliens arriving at the border found in] section 1225(b)(1) of this title) is governed only by chapter 158 of title 28 [the Hobbs Act], except as provided in subsection (b) of this section [which modifies some of the Hobbs Act provisions] and except that the court may not order the taking of additional evidence under section 2347(c) of [Title 28].\" (Emphasis added.)~    ~    ~      62~      In other words, if judicial review is available, it consists only of the modified Hobbs Act review specified in 1252(a)(1).~    ~    ~      63~      In some cases (including, as it happens, the one before us), there can be no review at all, because IIRIRA categorically and unequivocally rules out judicial review of challenges to deportation brought by certain kinds of criminal aliens. Section 1252(a)(2)(C) provides:~    ~    ~      64~      \"Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed [one or more enumerated] criminal offense[s] [including drug-trafficking offenses of the sort of which respondent had been convicted].\" (Emphases added).~    ~    ~      65~      Finally, the pre-IIRIRA antecedent to the foregoing provisions AEDPA 401(e) and the statutory background against which that was enacted, confirm that 2241 habeas review, in the district court or elsewhere, has been unequivocally repealed. In 1961, Congress amended the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (INA), 66 Stat. 163, by directing that the procedure for Hobbs Act review in the courts of appeals \"shall apply to, and shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for, the judicial review of all final orders of deportation\" under the INA. 8 U.S.C.  1105a(a) (repealed Sept. 30, 1996) (emphasis added). Like 8 U.S.C.  1252(a)(2)(C) (1994 ed., Supp. V), this provision squarely prohibited 2241 district-court habeas review. At the same time that it enacted this provision, however, the 1961 Congress enacted a specific exception: \"any alien held in custody pursuant to an order of deportation may obtain judicial review thereof by habeas corpus proceedings,\" 8 U.S.C.  1105a(a)(10) (1994 ed.). (This would of course have been surplusage had 2241 habeas review not been covered by the \"sole and exclusive procedure\" provision.) Section 401(e) of AEDPA repealed this narrow exception, and there is no doubt what the repeal was thought to accomplish: the provision was entitled \"Elimination of Custody Review by Habeas Corpus.\" It gave universal preclusive effect to the \"sole and exclusive procedure\" language of 1105a(a). And it is this regime that IIRIRA has carried forward.~    ~    ~      66~      The Court's efforts to derive ambiguity from this utmost clarity are unconvincing. First, the Court argues that 1252(a)(2)(C) and 1252(b)(9) are not as clear as one might think that, even though they are sufficient to repeal the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals, see Calcano-Martinez v. INS, post, at 3-4,1 they do not cover habeas jurisdiction in the district court, since, \"[i]n the immigration context, 'judicial review' and 'habeas corpus' have historically distinct meanings,\" ante, at 21, and 22, n. 35. Of course 1252(a)(2)(C) does not even use the term \"judicial review\" (it says \"jurisdiction to review\") but let us make believe it does. The Court's contention that in this statute it does not include habeas corpus is decisively refuted by the language of 1252(e)(2), enacted along with 1252(a)(2)(C) and 1252(b)(9): \"Judicial review of any determination made under section 1225(b)(1) of this title [governing review of expedited removal orders against undocumented aliens arriving at the border] is available in habeas corpus proceedings   .\" (Emphases added.) It is hard to imagine how Congress could have made it any clearer that, when it used the term \"judicial review\" in IIRIRA, it included judicial review through habeas corpus. Research into the \"historical\" usage of the term \"judicial review\" is thus quite beside the point.~    ~    ~      67~      But the Court is demonstrably wrong about that as well. Before IIRIRA was enacted, from 1961 to 1996, the governing immigration statutes unquestionably treated \"judicial review\" as encompassing review by habeas corpus. As discussed earlier, 8 U.S.C.  1105a (1994 ed.) made Hobbs Act review \"the sole and exclusive procedure for, the judicial review of all final orders of deportation\" (emphasis added), but created (in subsection (a)(10)) a limited exception for habeas corpus review. Section 1105a was entitled \"Judicial review of orders of deportation and exclusion\" (emphasis added), and the exception for habeas corpus stated that \"any alien held in custody pursuant to an order of deportation may obtain judicial review thereof by habeas corpus proceedings,\" ibid. (emphases added). Apart from this prior statutory usage, many of our own immigration cases belie the Court's suggestion that the term \"judicial review,\" when used in the immigration context, does not include review by habeas corpus. See, e.g., United States v. Mendozanbhyph;Lopez, 481 U.S. 828, 836-837 (1987) (\"[A]ny alien held in custody pursuant to an order of deportation may obtain judicial review of that order in a habeas corpus proceeding\" (emphases added)); Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, 349 U.S. 48, 52 (1955) (\"Our holding is that there is a right of judicial review of deportation orders other than by habeas corpus  \" (emphases added)); see also id., at 49.~    ~    ~      68~      The only support the Court offers in support of the asserted \"longstanding distinction between 'judicial review' and 'habeas,' \" ante, at 22, n. 35, is language from a single opinion of this Court, Heikkila v. Barber, 345 U.S. 229 (1953).2 There, we \"differentiate[d]\" \"habeas corpus\" from \"judicial review as that term is used in the Administrative Procedure Act.\" Id., at 236 (emphasis added). But that simply asserts that habeas corpus review is different from ordinary APA review, which no one doubts. It does not assert that habeas corpus review is not judicial review at all. Nowhere does Heikkila make such an implausible contention.3~    ~    ~      69~      The Court next contends that the zipper clause, 1252(b)(9), \"by its own terms, does not bar\" 2241 district-court habeas review of removal orders, ante, at 23, because the opening sentence of subsection (b) states that \"[w]ith respect to review of an order of removal under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the following requirements apply   .\" (Emphasis added.) But in the broad sense, 1252(b)(9) does \"apply\" \"to review of an order of removal under subsection (a)(1),\" because it mandates that \"review of all questions of law and fact   arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States under this subchapter\" must take place in connection with such review. This is \"application\" enough  and to insist that subsection (b)(9) be given effect only within the review of removal orders that takes place under subsection (a)(1), is to render it meaningless. Moreover, other of the numbered subparagraphs of subsection (b) make clear that the introductory sentence does not at all operate as a limitation upon what follows. Subsection (b)(7) specifies the procedure by which \"a defendant in a criminal proceeding\" charged with failing to depart after being ordered to do so may contest \"the validity of [a removal] order\" before trial; and subsection (b)(8) prescribes some of the prerogatives and responsibilities of the Attorney General and the alien after entry of a final removal order. These provisions have no effect if they must apply (even in the broad sense that subsection (b)(9) can be said to apply) \"to review of an order of removal under subsection (a)(1).\"~    ~    ~      70~      Unquestionably, unambiguously, and unmistakably, IIRIRA expressly supersedes 2241's general provision for habeas jurisdiction. The Court asserts that Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651 (1996), and Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wall. 85 (1869), reflect a \"longstanding rule requiring a clear statement of congressional intent to repeal habeas jurisdiction,\" ante, at 7. They do no such thing. Those cases simply applied the general principle not unique to habeas that \"[r]epeals by implication are not favored.\" Felker, supra, at 660; Yerger, supra, at 105. Felker held that a statute which by its terms prohibited only further review by this Court (or by an en banc court of appeals) of a court-of-appeals panel's \" 'grant or denial of   authorization   to file a second or successive [habeas] application,' \" 518 U.S., at 657 (quoting 28 U.S.C.  2244(b)(3)(E) (1994 ed., Supp. II)), should not be read to imply the repeal of this Court's separate and distinct \"authority [under 28 U.S.C.  2241 and 28 U.S.C.  2254 (1994 ed. and Supp. V)] to hear habeas petitions filed as original matters in this Court,\" 518 U.S., at 661. Yerger held that an 1868 Act that by its terms \"repeal[ed] only so much of the act of 1867 as authorized appeals, or the exercise of appellate jurisdiction by this court,\" should be read to \"reach no [further than] the act of 1867,\" and did not repeal by implication the appellate jurisdiction conferred by the Judiciary Act of 1789 and other pre-1867 enactments. 8 Wall., at 105. In the present case, unlike in Felker and Yerger, none of the statutory provisions relied upon 1252(a)(2)(C), 1252(b)(9), or 8 U.S.C.  1105a(a) (1994 ed.) requires us to imply from one statutory provision the repeal of another. All by their terms prohibit the judicial review at issue in this case.~    ~    ~      71~      The Court insists, however, that since \"[n]either [1252(a)(1) nor 1252(a)(2)(C)] explicitly mentions habeas, or 28 U.S.C.  2241\" \"neither provision speaks with sufficient clarity to bar jurisdiction pursuant to the general habeas statute.\" Ante, at 22-23. Even in those areas of our jurisprudence where we have adopted a \"clear statement\" rule (notably, the sovereign immunity cases to which the Court adverts, ante, at 8, n. 10), clear statement has never meant the kind of magic words demanded by the Court today explicit reference to habeas or to 2241 rather than reference to \"judicial review\" in a statute that explicitly calls habeas corpus a form of judicial review. In Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 467 (1991), we said:~    ~    ~      72~      \"This [the Court's clear-statement requirement] does not mean that the [Age Discrimination in Employment] Act must mention [state] judges explicitly, though it does not. Cf. Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U.S. 223, 233 (1989) (Scalia, J., concurring). Rather, it must be plain to anyone reading the Act that it covers judges.\"~    ~    ~      73~      In Gregory, as in United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U.S. 30, 34-35 (1992), and Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 241, 246 (1985), we held that the clear-statement requirement was not met, not because there was no explicit reference to the Eleventh Amendment, but because the statutory intent to eliminate state sovereign immunity was not clear. For the reasons discussed above, the intent to eliminate habeas jurisdiction in the present case is entirely clear, and that is all that is required.~    ~    ~      74~      It has happened before too frequently, alas that courts have distorted plain statutory text in order to produce a \"more sensible\" result. The unique accomplishment of today's opinion is that the result it produces is as far removed from what is sensible as its statutory construction is from the language of the text. One would have to study our statute books for a long time to come up with a more unlikely disposition. By authorizing 2241 habeas review in the district court but foreclosing review in the court of appeals, see Calcano-Martinez, post, at 3-4, the Court's interpretation routes all legal challenges to removal orders brought by criminal aliens to the district court, to be adjudicated under that court's 2241 habeas authority, which specifies no time limits. After review by that court, criminal aliens will presumably have an appeal as of right to the court of appeals, and can then petition this Court for a writ of certiorari. In contrast, noncriminal aliens seeking to challenge their removal orders for example, those charged with having been inadmissible at the time of entry, with having failed to maintain their nonimmigrant status, with having procured a visa through a marriage that was not bona fide, or with having become, within five years after the date of entry, a public charge, see 8 U.S.C.  1227(a)(1)(A), (a)(1)(C), (a)(1)(G), (a)(5) (1994 ed., Supp. V) will still presumably be required to proceed directly to the court of appeals by way of petition for review, under the restrictive modified Hobbs Act review provisions set forth in 1252(a)(1), including the 30-day filing deadline, see 1252(b)(1). In fact, prior to the enactment of IIRIRA, criminal aliens also had to follow this procedure for immediate modified Hobbs Act review in the court of appeals. See 8 U.S.C.  1105a(a) (1994 ed.). The Court has therefore succeeded in perverting a statutory scheme designed to expedite the removal of criminal aliens into one that now affords them more opportunities for (and layers of) judicial review (and hence more opportunities for delay) than are afforded non-criminal aliens and more than were afforded criminal aliens prior to the enactment of IIRIRA.4 This outcome speaks for itself; no Congress ever imagined it.~    ~    ~      75~      To excuse the violence it does to the statutory text, the Court invokes the doctrine of constitutional doubt, which it asserts is raised by the Suspension Clause, U.S. Const., Art. I, 9, cl. 2. This uses one distortion to justify another, transmogrifying a doctrine designed to maintain \"a just respect for the legislature,\" Ex parte Randolph, 20 F. Cas. 242, 254 (No. 11,558) (CC Va. 1833) (Marshall, on circuit), into a means of thwarting the clearly expressed intent of the legislature. The doctrine of constitutional doubt is meant to effectuate, not to subvert, congressional intent, by giving ambiguous provisions a meaning that will avoid constitutional peril, and that will conform with Congress's presumed intent not to enact measures of dubious validity. The condition precedent for application of the doctrine is that the statute can reasonably be construed to avoid the constitutional difficulty. See, e.g., Miller v. French, 530 U.S. 327, 341 (2000) (\" 'We cannot press statutory construction \"to the point of disingenuous evasion\" even to avoid a constitutional question ' \" (quoting United States v. Locke, 471 U.S. 84, 96 (1985), in turn quoting George Moore Ice Cream Co. v. Rose, 289 U.S. 373, 379 (1933))); Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 60 (1997) (quoting Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 57, n. 9 (1996)). It is a device for interpreting what the statute says not for ignoring what the statute says in order to avoid the trouble of determining whether what it says is unconstitutional. For the reasons I have set forth above, it is crystal clear that the statute before us here bars criminal aliens from obtaining judicial review, including 2241 district-court review, of their removal orders. It is therefore also crystal clear that the doctrine of constitutional doubt has no application.~    ~    ~      76~      In the remainder of this opinion I address the question the Court should have addressed: Whether these provisions of IIRIRA are unconstitutional.~    ~    II~    ~      77~      * The Suspension Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, 9, cl. 2, provides as follows:~    ~    ~      78~      \"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\"A straightforward reading of this text discloses that it does not guarantee any content to (or even the existence of) the writ of habeas corpus, but merely provides that the writ shall not (except in case of rebellion or invasion) be suspended. See R. Fallon, D. Meltzer,  D. Shapiro, Hart  Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System 1369 (4th ed. 1996) (\"[T]he text [of the Suspension Clause] does not confer a right to habeas relief, but merely sets forth when the 'Privilege of the Writ' may be suspended\"). Indeed, that was precisely the objection expressed by four of the state ratifying conventions that the Constitution failed affirmatively to guarantee a right to habeas corpus. See Collings, Habeas Corpus for Convicts Constitutional Right or Legislative Grace?, 40 Calif. L. Rev. 335, 340, and nn. 39-41 (1952) (citing 1 J. Elliott, Debates on the Federal Constitution 328 (2d ed. 1836) (New York); 3 id., at 658 (Virginia); 4 id., at 243 (North Carolina); 1 id., at 334 (Rhode Island)).~    ~    ~      79~      To \"suspend\" the writ was not to fail to enact it, much less to refuse to accord it particular content. Noah Webster, in his American Dictionary of the English Language, defined it with patriotic allusion to the constitutional text as \"[t]o cause to cease for a time from operation or effect; as, to suspend the habeas corpus act.\" Vol. 2, p. 86 (1828 ed.). See also N. Bailey, An Universal Etymological English Dictionary (1789) (\"To Suspend [in Law] signifies a temporal stop of a man's right\"); 2 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language 1958 (1773) (\"to make to stop for a time\"). This was a distinct abuse of majority power, and one that had manifested itself often in the Framers' experience: temporarily but entirely eliminating the \"Privilege of the Writ\" for a certain geographic area or areas, or for a certain class or classes of individuals. Suspension Acts had been adopted (and many more proposed) both in this country and in England during the late 18th century, see B. Mian, American Habeas Corpus: Law, History, and Politics 109-127 (1984) including a 7-month suspension by the Massachusetts Assembly during Shay's Rebellion in 1787, id., at 117. Typical of the genre was the prescription by the Statute of 1794, 34 Geo. 3, c. 54, 2, that \" '  [An Act for preventing wrongous imprisonment, and against undue delays in trials], insofar as the same may be construed to relate to the cases of Treason and suspicion of Treason, be suspended [for one year]   .' \" Mian, supra, at 110. See also 16 Annals of Congress 44, 402-425 (1852) (recording the debate on a bill, reported to the House of Representatives from the Senate on January 26, 1807, and ultimately rejected, to \"suspen[d], for and during the term of three months,\" \"the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus\" for \"any person or persons, charged on oath with treason, misprision of treason,\" and other specified offenses arising out of the Aaron Burr conspiracy).~    ~    ~      80~      In the present case, of course, Congress has not temporarily withheld operation of the writ, but has permanently altered its content. That is, to be sure, an act subject to majoritarian abuse, as is Congress's framing (or its determination not to frame) a habeas statute in the first place. But that is not the majoritarian abuse against which the Suspension Clause was directed. It is no more irrational to guard against the common and well known \"suspension\" abuse, without guaranteeing any particular habeas right that enjoys immunity from suspension, than it is, in the Equal Protection Clause, to guard against unequal application of the laws, without guaranteeing any particular law which enjoys that protection. And it is no more acceptable for this Court to write a habeas law, in order that the Suspension Clause might have some effect, than it would be for this Court to write other laws, in order that the Equal Protection Clause might have some effect.~    ~    ~      81~      The Court cites many cases which it says establish that it is a \"serious and difficult constitutional issue,\" ante, at 14, whether the Suspension Clause prohibits the elimination of habeas jurisdiction effected by IIRIRA. Every one of those cases, however, pertains not to the meaning of the Suspension Clause, but to the content of the habeas corpus provision of the United States Code, which is quite a different matter. The closest the Court can come is a statement in one of those cases to the effect that the Immigration Act of 1917 \"had the effect of precluding judicial intervention in deportation cases except insofar as it was required by the Constitution,\" Heikkila, 345 U.S., at 234-235. That statement (1) was pure dictum, since the Court went on to hold that the judicial review of petitioner's deportation order was unavailable; (2) does not specify to what extent judicial review was \"required by the Constitution,\" which could (as far as the Court's holding was concerned) be zero; and, most important of all, (3) does not refer to the Suspension Clause, so could well have had in mind the due process limitations upon the procedures for determining deportability that our later cases establish, see Part III, infra.~    ~    ~      82~      There is, however, another Supreme Court dictum that is unquestionably in point an unusually authoritative one at that, since it was written by Chief Justice Marshall in 1807. It supports precisely the interpretation of the Suspension Clause I have set forth above. In Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75, one of the cases arising out of the Burr conspiracy, the issue presented was whether the Supreme Court had the power to issue a writ of habeas corpus for the release of two prisoners held for trial under warrant of the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia. Counsel for the detainees asserted not only statutory authority for issuance of the writ, but inherent power. See id., at 77-93. The Court would have nothing to do with that, whether under Article III or any other provision. While acknowledging an inherent power of the courts \"over their own officers, or to protect themselves, and their members, from being disturbed in the exercise of their functions,\" Marshall says that \"the power of taking cognizance of any question between individuals, or between the government and individuals, must be given by written law.\"~    ~    ~      83~      \"The inquiry, therefore, on this motion will be, whether by any statute compatible with the constitution of the United States, the power to award a writ of habeas corpus, in such a case as that of Erik Bollman and Samuel Swartwout, has been given to this court.\" Id., at 94.~    ~    ~      84~      In the ensuing discussion of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the opinion specifically addresses the Suspension Clause not invoking it as a source of habeas jurisdiction, but to the contrary pointing out that without legislated habeas jurisdiction the Suspension Clause would have no effect.~    ~    ~      85~      \"It may be worthy of remark, that this act was passed by the first congress of the United States, sitting under a constitution which had declared 'that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus should not be suspended, unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety might require it.'~    ~    ~      86~      \"Acting under the immediate influence of this injunction, they must have felt, with peculiar force, the obligation of providing efficient means by which this great constitutional privilege should receive life and activity; for if the means be not in existence, the privilege itself would be lost, although no law for its suspension should be enacted. Under the impression of this obligation, they give to all the courts the power of awarding writs of habeas corpus.\" Id., at 95.5~    ~    ~      87~      There is no more reason for us to believe, than there was for the Marshall Court to believe, that the Suspension Clause means anything other than what it says.~    ~    B~    ~      88~      Even if one were to assume that the Suspension Clause, despite its text and the Marshall Court's understanding, guarantees some constitutional minimum of habeas relief, that minimum would assuredly not embrace the rarified right asserted here: the right to judicial compulsion of the exercise of Executive discretion (which may be exercised favorably or unfavorably) regarding a prisoner's release. If one reads the Suspension Clause as a guarantee of habeas relief, the obvious question presented is: What habeas relief? There are only two alternatives, the first of which is too absurd to be seriously entertained. It could be contended that Congress \"suspends\" the writ whenever it eliminates any prior ground for the writ that it adopted. Thus, if Congress should ever (in the view of this Court) have authorized immediate habeas corpus without the need to exhaust administrative remedies for a person arrested as an illegal alien, Congress would never be able (in the light of sad experience) to revise that disposition. The Suspension Clause, in other words, would be a one-way ratchet that enshrines in the Constitution every grant of habeas jurisdiction. This is, as I say, too absurd to be contemplated, and I shall contemplate it no further.~    ~    ~      89~      The other alternative is that the Suspension Clause guarantees the common-law right of habeas corpus, as it was understood when the Constitution was ratified. There is no doubt whatever that this did not include the right to obtain discretionary release. The Court notes with apparent credulity respondent's contention \"that there is historical evidence of the writ issuing to redress the improper exercise of official discretion,\" ante, at 13. The only Framing-era or earlier cases it alludes to in support of that contention, see ante, at 12, n. 23, referred to ante, at 13, establish no such thing. In Ex parte Boggin, 104 Eng. Rep. 484 (K. B. 1811), the court did not even bother calling for a response from the custodian, where the applicant failed to show that he was statutorily exempt from impressment under any statute then in force. In Chalacombe's Case, reported in a footnote in Ex parte Boggin, the court did \"let the writ go\" i.e., called for a response from the Admiralty to Chalacombe's petition even though counsel for the Admiralty had argued that the Admiralty's general policy of not impressing \"seafaring persons of [Chalacombe's] description\" was \"a matter of grace and favour, [and not] of right.\" But the court never decided that it had authority to grant the relief requested (since the Admiralty promptly discharged Chalacombe of its own accord); in fact, it expressed doubt whether it had that authority. See 104 Eng. Rep., at 484, n.(a)2 (Lord Ellenborough, C. J.) (\"Considering it merely as a question of discretion, is it not more fit that this should stand over for the consideration of the Admiralty, to whom the matter ought to be disclosed?\"). And in Hollingshead's Case, 91 Eng. Rep. 307 (K. B. 1702), the \"warrant of commitment\" issued by the \"commissioners of bankrupt\" was \"held naught,\" since it authorized the bankrupt's continued detention by the commissioners until \"otherwise discharged by due course of law,\" whereas the statute authorized commitment only \"till [the bankrupt] submit himself to be examined by the commissioners.\" (Emphasis deleted.) There is nothing pertaining to executive discretion here.~    ~    ~      90~      All the other Framing-era or earlier cases cited in the Court's opinion indeed, all the later Supreme Court cases until United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, in 1954 provide habeas relief from executive detention only when the custodian had no legal authority to detain. See 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 1333, p. 206 (1833) (the writ lies to ascertain whether a \"sufficient ground of detention appears\"). The fact is that, far from forming a traditional basis for issuance of the writ of habeas corpus, the whole \"concept of 'discretion' was not well developed at common law,\" Hafetz, The Untold Story of Noncriminal Habeas Corpus and the 1996 Immigration Acts, 107 Yale L. J. 2509, 2534 (1998), quoted in Brief for Respondent in Calcano-Martinez v. INS, O. T. 2000, No. 00-1011, p. 37. An exhaustive search of cases antedating the Suspension Clause discloses few instances in which courts even discussed the concept of executive discretion; and on the rare occasions when they did, they simply confirmed what seems obvious from the paucity of such discussions namely, that courts understood executive discretion as lying entirely beyond the judicial ken. See, e.g., Chalacombe's Case, supra, at ___. That is precisely what one would expect, since even the executive's evaluation of the facts a duty that was a good deal more than discretionary was not subject to review on habeas. Both in this country, until passage of the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867, and in England, the longstanding rule had been that the truth of the custodian's return could not be controverted. See, e.g., Opinion on the Writ of Habeas Corpus, 97 Eng. Rep. 29, 43 (H. L. 1758); Note, Developments in the Law Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv. L. Rev. 1038, 1113-1114, and nn. 9-11 (1970) (quoting Act of Feb. 5, 1867, ch. 28, 1, 14 Stat. 385); Oaks, Legal History in the High Court Habeas Corpus, 64 Mich. L. Rev. 451, 453 (1966). And, of course, going beyond inquiry into the legal authority of the executive to detain would have been utterly incompatible with the well-established limitation upon habeas relief for a convicted prisoner: \"[O]nce a person had been convicted by a superior court of general jurisdiction, a court disposing of a habeas corpus petition could not go behind the conviction for any purpose other than to verify the formal jurisdiction of the committing court.\" Id., at 468, quoted in Swain v. Pressley, 430 U.S. 372, 384-385 (1977) (Burger, C. J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).~    ~    ~      91~      In sum, there is no authority whatever for the proposition that, at the time the Suspension Clause was ratified or, for that matter, even for a century and a half thereafter habeas corpus relief was available to compel the Executive's allegedly wrongful refusal to exercise discretion. The striking proof of that proposition is that when, in 1954, the Warren Court held that the Attorney General's alleged refusal to exercise his discretion under the Immigration Act of 1917 could be reviewed on habeas, see United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, supra, it did so without citation of any supporting authority, and over the dissent of Justice Jackson, joined by three other Justices, who wrote:~    ~    ~      92~      \"Of course, it may be thought that it would be better government if even executive acts of grace were subject to judicial review. But the process of the Court seems adapted only to the determination of legal rights, and here the decision is thrusting upon the courts the task of reviewing a discretionary and purely executive function. Habeas corpus, like the currency, can be debased by over-issue quite as certainly as by too niggardly use. We would . . . leave the responsibility for suspension or execution of this deportation squarely on the Attorney General, where Congress has put it.\" Id., at 271.III~    ~    ~      93~      Given the insubstantiality of the due process and Article III arguments against barring judicial review of respondent's claim (the Court does not even bother to mention them, and the Court of Appeals barely acknowledges them), I will address them only briefly.~    ~    ~      94~      The Due Process Clause does not \"[r]equir[e] [j]udicial [d]etermination [o]f\" respondent's claim, Brief for Petitioners in Calcano-Martinez, v. INS, O. T. 2000, No. 00-1011, p. 34. Respondent has no legal entitlement to suspension of deportation, no matter how appealing his case. \"[T]he Attorney General's suspension of deportation [is] ''an act of grace'' which is accorded pursuant to her 'unfettered discretion,' Jay v. Boyd, 351 U.S. 345, 354 (1956)   , and [can be likened, as Judge Learned Hand observed,] to ''a judge's power to suspend the execution of a sentence, or the President's to pardon a convict,'' 351 U.S., at 354, n. 16   .\" INS v. Yueh-Shaio Yang, 519 U.S. 26, 30 (1996). The furthest our cases have gone in imposing due process requirements upon analogous exercises of executive discretion is the following. (1) We have required \"minimal procedural safeguards\" for death-penalty clemency proceedings, to prevent them from becoming so capricious as to involve \"a state official flipp[ing] a coin to determine whether to grant clemency,\" Ohio Adult Parole Authority v. Woodard, 523 U.S. 272, 289 (1998) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Even assuming that this holding is not part of our \"death-is-different\" jurisprudence, Shafer v. South Carolina, 532 U.S. ___, ___ (2001) (slip op., at 1) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (citation omitted), respondent here is not complaining about the absence of procedural safeguards; he disagrees with the Attorney General's judgment on a point of law. (2) We have recognized the existence of a due process liberty interest when a State's statutory parole procedures prescribe that a prisoner \"shall\" be paroled if certain conditions are satisfied, see Board of Pardons v. Allen, 482 U.S. 369, 370-371, 381 (1987); Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Correctional Complex, 442 U.S. 1, 12 (1979). There is no such statutory entitlement to suspension of deportation, no matter what the facts. Moreover, in neither Woodard, nor Allen, nor Greenholtz did we intimate that the Due Process Clause conferred jurisdiction of its own force, without benefit of statutory authorization. All three cases were brought under 42 U.S.C.  1983.~    ~    ~      95~      Article III, 1's investment of the \"judicial Power of the United States\" in the federal courts does not prevent Congress from committing the adjudication of respondent's legal claim wholly to \"non-Article III federal adjudicative bodies,\" Brief for Petitioners in Calcano-Martinez v. INS, O. T. 2000, No. 00-1011, p. 38. The notion that Article III requires every Executive determination, on a question of law or of fact, to be subject to judicial review has no support in our jurisprudence. Were it correct, the doctrine of sovereign immunity would not exist, and the APA's general permission of suits challenging administrative action, see 5 U.S.C.  702 would have been superfluous. Of its own force, Article III does no more than commit to the courts matters that are \"the stuff of the traditional actions at common law tried by the courts at Westminster in 1789,\" Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. 50, 90 (1982) (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment) which (as I have discussed earlier) did not include supervision of discretionary executive action.~    ~    ~      96~      * * *~    ~    ~      97~      The Court has created a version of IIRIRA that is not only unrecognizable to its framers (or to anyone who can read) but gives the statutory scheme precisely the opposite of its intended effect, affording criminal aliens more opportunities for delay-inducing judicial review than others have, or even than criminal aliens had prior to the enactment of this legislation. Because 2241's exclusion of judicial review is unmistakably clear, and unquestionably constitutional, both this Court and the courts below were without power to entertain respondent's claims. I would set aside the judgment of the court below and remand with instructions to have the District Court dismiss for want of jurisdiction. I respectfully dissent from the judgment of the Court.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~          In the course of this opinion I shall refer to some of the Court's analysis in this companion case; the two opinions are intertwined.~      ~      ~        2~          The recent Circuit authorities cited by the Court, which postdate IIRIRA, see Mahadeo v. Reno, 226 F.3d 3, 12 (CA1 2000); and Flores-Miramontes v. INS, 212 F.3d 1133, 1140 (CA9 2000)), cited ante, at 23, hardly demonstrate any historical usage upon which IIRIRA was based. Anyway, these cases rely for their analysis upon a third circuit-court decision Sandoval v. Reno, 166 F.3d 225, 235 (CA3 1999) which simply relies on the passage from Heikkila under discussion.~      ~      ~        3~          The older, pre-1961 judicial interpretations relied upon by the Court, see ante, at 21-22, are similarly unavailing. Ekiu v. United States, 142 U.S. 651 (1892), never purported to distinguish \"judicial review\" from habeas, and the Court's attempt to extract such a distinction from the opinion is unpersuasive. Ekiu did state that the statute \"prevent[ed] the question of an alien immigrant's right to land, when once decided adversely by an inspector, acting within the jurisdiction conferred upon him, from being impeached or reviewed,\" id., at 663 (emphasis added), italicized words quoted ante, at 22; but the clear implication was that the question whether the inspector was \"acting within the jurisdiction conferred upon him\" was reviewable. The distinction pertained, in short, to the scope of judicial review on habeas not to whether judicial review was available. Terlinden v. Ames, 184 U.S. 270, 278 (1902), likewise drew no distinction between \"judicial review\" and habeas; it simply stated that the extradition statute \"gives no right of review to be exercised by any court or judicial officer, and what cannot be done directly [under the extradition statute] cannot be done indirectly through the writ of habeas corpus.\" Far from saying that habeas is not a form of judicial review, it says that habeas is an indirect means of review.~      ~      ~        4~          The Court disputes this conclusion by observing that \"the scope of review on habeas is considerably more limited than on APA-style review,\" ante, at 24, n. 38 (a statement, by the way, that confirms our contention that habeas is, along with the APA, one form of judicial review). It is more limited, to be sure but not \"considerably more limited\" in any respect that would disprove the fact that criminal aliens are much better off than others. In all the many cases that (like the present one) involve \"question[s] of law,\" ibid., the Court's statutory misconstruction gives criminal aliens a preferred position.~      ~      ~        5~          The Court claims that I \"rea[d] into Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in Ex parte Bollman   support for a proposition that the Chief Justice did not endorse, either explicitly or implicitly,\" ante, at 13, n. 24. Its support for this claim is a highly selective quotation from the opinion, see ibid. There is nothing \"implici[t]\" whatsoever about Chief Justice Marshall's categorical statement that \"the power to award the writ [of habeas corpus] by any of the courts of the United States, must be given by written law,\" 4 Cranch, at 94. See also ibid., quoted supra, at 15 (\"[T]he power of taking cognizance of any question between individuals, or between the government and individuals   must be given by written law\"). If, as the Court concedes, \"the writ could not be suspended,\" ante, at 13, n. 24, within the meaning of the Suspension Clause until Congress affirmatively provided for habeas by statute, then surely Congress may subsequently alter what it had initially provided for, lest the Clause become a one-way ratchet, see supra, at __. The Court's position that a permanent repeal of habeas jurisdiction is unthinkable (and hence a violation of the Suspension Clause) is simply incompatible with its (and Marshall's) belief that a failure to confer habeas jurisdiction is not unthinkable.~      ~    ~    ",

After petitioner state game wardens executed state-court and tribal-court search warrants to search Hicks's home for evidence of an off-reservation crime, he filed suit in the Tribal Court against, inter alios, the wardens in their individual capacities and petitioner Nevada, alleging trespass, abuse of process, and violation of constitutional rights remediable under 42 U.S.C.  1983. The Tribal Court held that it had jurisdiction over the tribal tort and federal civil rights claims, and the Tribal Appeals Court affirmed. Petitioners then sought, in Federal District Court, a declaratory judgment that the Tribal Court lacked jurisdiction over the claims. The District Court granted respondents summary judgment on that issue and held that the wardens would have to exhaust their qualified immunity claims in the Tribal Court. In affirming, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the fact that Hicks's home is on tribe-owned reservation land is sufficient to support tribal jurisdiction over civil claims against nonmembers arising from their activities on that land.~      Held:~      1. The Tribal Court did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate the wardens' alleged tortious conduct in executing a search warrant for an off-reservation crime. Pp. 3-12.~      (a) As to nonmembers, a tribal court's inherent adjudicatory authority is at most as broad as the tribe's regulatory authority. Strate v. A-1 Contractors, 520 U.S. 438, 453. Pp. 3-4.~      (b) The rule that, where nonmembers are concerned, \"the exercise of tribal power beyond what is necessary to protect tribal self-government or to control internal relations   cannot survive without express congressional delegation,\" Montana v. United States, 450 U.S. 544, 564, applies to both Indian and non-Indian land. The land's ownership status is only one factor to be considered, and while that factor may sometimes be dispositive, tribal ownership is not alone enough to support regulatory jurisdiction over nonmembers. Pp. 4-6.~      (c) Tribal authority to regulate state officers in executing process related to the off-reservation violation of state laws is not essential to tribal self-government or internal relations. The State's interest in executing process is considerable, and it no more impairs the Tribes' self-government than federal enforcement of federal law impairs state government. The State's interest is not diminished because this suit is against officials in their individual capacities. Pp. 6-11.~      (d) Congress has not stripped the States of their inherent jurisdiction on reservations with regard to off-reservation violations of state law. The federal statutory scheme neither prescribes nor suggests that state officers cannot enter a reservation to investigate or prosecute such violations. Pp. 11-12.~      2. The Tribal Court had no jurisdiction over the 1983 claims. Tribal courts are not courts of \"general jurisdiction.\" The historical and constitutional assumption of concurrent state-court jurisdiction over cases involving federal statutes is missing with respect to tribal courts, and their inherent adjudicative jurisdiction over nonmembers is at most only as broad as their legislative jurisdiction. Congress has not purported to grant tribal courts jurisdiction over 1983 claims, and such jurisdiction would create serious anomalies under 28 U.S.C.  1441. Pp. 12-15.~      3. Petitioners were not required to exhaust their claims in the Tribal Court before bringing them in the Federal District Court. Because the rule that tribal courts lack jurisdiction over state officials for causes of action relating to their performance of official duties is clear, adherence to the tribal exhaustion requirement would serve no purpose other than delay and is therefore unnecessary. Pp. 15-16.~      4. Various arguments to the contrary lack merit. Pp. 16-21.196 F.3d 1020, reversed and remanded.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OFAPPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT~      Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, and Ginsburg, JJ., joined.~      Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      This case presents the question whether a tribal court may assert jurisdiction over civil claims against state officials who entered tribal land to execute a search warrant against a tribe member suspected of having violated state law outside the reservation.~    ~    ~      2~      * Respondent Hicks1 is one of about 900 members of the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribes of western Nevada. He resides on the Tribes' reservation of approximately 8000 acres, established by federal statute in 1908, ch. 53, 35 Stat. 85. In 1990 Hicks came under suspicion of having killed, off the reservation, a California bighorn sheep, a gross misdemeanor under Nevada law, see Nev. Rev. Stat. 501.376 (1999). A state game warden obtained from state court a search warrant \"SUBJECT TO OBTAINING APPROVAL FROM THE FALLON TRIBAL COURT IN AND FOR THE FALLON PAIUTE-SHOSHONE TRIBES.\" According to the issuing judge, this tribal-court authorization was necessary because \"[t]his Court has no jurisdiction on the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Indian Reservation.\" App. G to Pet. for Cert. 1. A search warrant was obtained from the tribal court, and the warden, accompanied by a tribal police officer, searched respondent's yard, uncovering only the head of a Rocky Mountain bighorn, a different (and unprotected) species of sheep.~    ~    ~      3~      Approximately one year later, a tribal police officer reported to the warden that he had observed two mounted bighorn sheep heads in respondent's home. The warden again obtained a search warrant from state court; though this warrant did not explicitly require permission from the Tribes, see App. F to Pet. for Cert. 2, a tribal-court warrant was nonetheless secured, and respondent's home was again (unsuccessfully) searched by three wardens and additional tribal officers.~    ~    ~      4~      Respondent, claiming that his sheep-heads had been damaged, and that the second search exceeded the bounds of the warrant, brought suit against the Tribal Judge, the tribal officers, the state wardens in their individual and official capacities, and the State of Nevada in the Tribal Court in and for the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribes. (His claims against all defendants except the state wardens and the State of Nevada were dismissed by directed verdict and are not at issue here.) Respondent's causes of action included trespass to land and chattels, abuse of process, and violation of civil rights specifically, denial of equal protection, denial of due process, and unreasonable search and seizure, each remediable under 42 U.S.C.  1983. See App. 8-21, 25-29. Respondent later voluntarily dismissed his case against the State and against the state officials in their official capacities, leaving only his suit against those officials in their individual capacities. See id., at 32-35.~    ~    ~      5~      The Tribal Court held that it had jurisdiction over the claims, a holding affirmed by the Tribal Appeals Court. The state officials and Nevada then filed an action in federal district court seeking a declaratory judgment that the Tribal Court lacked jurisdiction. The District Court granted summary judgment to respondent on the issue of jurisdiction, and also held that the state officials would have to exhaust any claims of qualified immunity in the tribal court. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding that the fact that respondent's home is located on tribe-owned land within the reservation is sufficient to support tribal jurisdiction over civil claims against nonmembers arising from their activities on that land. 196 F.3d 1020 (1999). We granted certiorari, 531 U.S. 923 (2000).~    ~    II~    ~      6~      In this case, which involves claims brought under both tribal and federal law, it is necessary to determine, as to the former, whether the Tribal Court in and for the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribes has jurisdiction to adjudicate the alleged tortious conduct of state wardens executing a search warrant for evidence of an off-reservation crime; and, as to the latter, whether the Tribal Court has jurisdiction over claims brought under 42 U.S.C.  1983. We address the former question first.~    ~    ~      7~      * The principle of Indian law central to this aspect of the case is our holding in Strate v. A-1 Contractors, 520 U.S. 438, 453 (1997): \"As to nonmembers   a tribe's adjudicative jurisdiction does not exceed its legislative jurisdiction   .\" That formulation leaves open the question whether a tribe's adjudicative jurisdiction over nonmember defendants equals its legislative jurisdiction.2 We will not have to answer that open question if we determine that the Tribes in any event lack legislative jurisdiction in this case. We first inquire, therefore, whether the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribes either as an exercise of their inherent sovereignty, or under grant of federal authority can regulate state wardens executing a search warrant for evidence of an off-reservation crime.~    ~    ~      8~      Indian tribes' regulatory authority over nonmembers is governed by the principles set forth in Montana v. United States, 450 U.S. 544 (1981), which we have called the \"pathmarking case\" on the subject, Strate, supra, at 445. In deciding whether the Crow Tribe could regulate hunting and fishing by nonmembers on land held in fee simple by nonmembers, Montana observed that, under our decision in Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe, 435 U.S. 191 (1978), tribes lack criminal jurisdiction over nonmembers. Although, it continued, \"Oliphant only determined inherent tribal authority in criminal matters, the principles on which it relied support the general proposition that the inherent sovereign powers of an Indian tribe do not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe.\" 450 U.S., at 565 (footnote omitted). Where nonmembers are concerned, the \"exercise of tribal power beyond what is necessary to protect tribal self-government or to control internal relations is inconsistent with the dependent status of the tribes, and so cannot survive without express congressional delegation.\" Id., at 564 (emphasis added).3~    ~    ~      9~      Both Montana and Strate rejected tribal authority to regulate nonmembers' activities on land over which the tribe could not \"assert a landowner's right to occupy and exclude,\" Strate, supra, at 456; Montana, supra, at 557, 564. Respondents and the United States argue that since Hicks's home and yard are on tribe-owned land within the reservation, the Tribe may make its exercise of regulatory authority over nonmembers a condition of nonmembers' entry. Not necessarily. While it is certainly true that the non-Indian ownership status of the land was central to the analysis in both Montana and Strate, the reason that was so was not that Indian ownership suspends the \"general proposition\" derived from Oliphant that \"the inherent sovereign powers of an Indian tribe do not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe\" except to the extent \"necessary to protect tribal self-government or to control internal relations.\" 450 U.S., at 564-565. Oliphant itself drew no distinctions based on the status of land. And Montana, after announcing the general rule of no jurisdiction over nonmembers, cautioned that \"[t]o be sure, Indian tribes retain inherent sovereign power to exercise some forms of civil jurisdiction over non-Indians on their reservations, even on non-Indian fee lands,\" 450 U.S., at 565 clearly implying that the general rule of Montana applies to both Indian and non-Indian land. The ownership status of land, in other words, is only one factor to consider in determining whether regulation of the activities of nonmembers is \"necessary to protect tribal self-government or to control internal relations.\" It may sometimes be a dispositive factor. Hitherto, the absence of tribal ownership has been virtually conclusive of the absence of tribal civil jurisdiction; with one minor exception, we have never upheld under Montana the extension of tribal civil authority over nonmembers on non-Indian land. Compare, e.g., Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U.S. 130, 137, 142 (1982) (tribe has taxing authority over tribal lands leased by nonmembers), with Atkinson Trading Co. v. Shirley, 532 U.S. ___ (2001) (slip op. at 13) (tribe has no taxing authority over nonmembers' activities on land held by nonmembers in fee); but see Brendale v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 492 U.S. 408, 443-444, 458-459 (1989) (opinions of Stevens, J., and Blackmun, J.) (tribe can impose zoning regulation on that 3.1% of land within reservation area closed to public entry that was not owned by the tribe). But the existence of tribal ownership is not alone enough to support regulatory jurisdiction over nonmembers.~    ~    ~      10~      We proceed to consider, successively, the following questions: whether regulatory jurisdiction over state officers in the present context is \"necessary to protect tribal self-government or to control internal relations,\" and, if not, whether such regulatory jurisdiction has been congressionally conferred.~    ~    B~    ~      11~      In Strate, we explained that what is necessary to protect tribal self-government and control internal relations can be understood by looking at the examples of tribal power to which Montana referred: tribes have authority \"[to punish tribal offenders,] to determine tribal membership, to regulate domestic relations among members, and to prescribe rules of inheritance for members,\" 520 U.S., at 459 (brackets in original), quoting Montana, supra, at 564. These examples show, we said, that Indians have \" 'the right   to make their own laws and be ruled by them,' \" 520 U.S., at 459, quoting Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S. 217, 220 (1959). See also Fisher v. District Court of Sixteenth Judicial Dist. of Mont., 424 U.S. 382, 386 (1976) (per curiam) (\"In litigation between Indians and non-Indians arising out of conduct on an Indian reservation, resolution of conflicts between the jurisdiction of state and tribal courts has depended, absent a governing Act of Congress, on whether the state action infringed on the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Tribal assertion of regulatory authority over nonmembers must be connected to that right of the Indians to make their own laws and be governed by them. See Merrion, supra, at 137, 142 (\"The power to tax is an essential attribute of Indian sovereignty because it is a necessary instrument of self-government,\" at least as to \"tribal lands\" on which the tribe \"has   authority over a nonmember\").~    ~    ~      12~      Our cases make clear that the Indians' right to make their own laws and be governed by them does not exclude all state regulatory authority on the reservation. State sovereignty does not end at a reservation's border. Though tribes are often referred to as \"sovereign\" entities, it was \"long ago\" that \"the Court departed from Chief Justice Marshall's view that 'the laws of [a State] can have no force' within reservation boundaries. Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 561 (1832),\" White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U.S. 136, 141 (1980).4 \"Ordinarily,\" it is now clear, \"an Indian reservation is considered part of the territory of the State.\" U.S. Dept. of Interior, Federal Indian Law 510, and n. 1 (1958), citing Utah  Northern R. Co. v. Fisher, 116 U.S. 28 (1885); see also Organized Village of Kake v. Egan, 369 U.S. 60, 72 (1962).~    ~    ~      13~      That is not to say that States may exert the same degree of regulatory authority within a reservation as they do without. To the contrary, the principle that Indians have the right to make their own laws and be governed by them requires \"an accommodation between the interests of the Tribes and the Federal Government, on the one hand, and those of the State, on the other.\" Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation, 447 U.S. 134, 156 (1980); see also id., at 181 (opinion of Rehnquist, J.). \"When on-reservation conduct involving only Indians is at issue, state law is generally inapplicable, for the State's regulatory interest is likely to be minimal and the federal interest in encouraging tribal self-government is at its strongest.\" Bracker, supra, at 144. When, however, state interests outside the reservation are implicated, States may regulate the activities even of tribe members on tribal land, as exemplified by our decision in Confederated Tribes. In that case, Indians were selling cigarettes on their reservation to nonmembers from off-reservation, without collecting the state cigarette tax. We held that the State could require the Tribes to collect the tax from nonmembers, and could \"impose at least 'minimal' burdens on the Indian retailer to aid in enforcing and collecting the tax,\" 447 U.S., at 151. It is also well established in our precedent that States have criminal jurisdiction over reservation Indians for crimes committed (as was the alleged poaching in this case) off the reservation. See Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U.S. 145, 148-149 (1973).~    ~    ~      14~      While it is not entirely clear from our precedent whether the last mentioned authority entails the corollary right to enter a reservation (including Indian-fee lands) for enforcement purposes, several of our opinions point in that direction. In Confederated Tribes, we explicitly reserved the question whether state officials could seize cigarettes held for sale to nonmembers in order to recover the taxes due. See 447 U.S., at 162. In Utah  Northern R. Co., however, we observed that \"[i]t has   been held that process of [state] courts may run into an Indian reservation of this kind, where the subject-matter or controversy is otherwise within their cognizance,\" 116 U.S., at 31.5 Shortly thereafter, we considered, in United States v. Kagama, 118 U.S. 375 (1886), whether Congress could enact a law giving federal courts jurisdiction over various common-law, violent crimes committed by Indians on a reservation within a State. We expressed skepticism that the Indian Commerce Clause could justify this assertion of authority in derogation of state jurisdiction, but ultimately accepted the argument that the law~    ~    ~      15~      \"does not interfere with the process of the State courts within the reservation, nor with the operation of State laws upon white people found there. Its effect is confined to the acts of an Indian of some tribe, of a criminal character, committed within the limits of the reservation.~    ~    ~      16~      \"It seems to us that this is within the competency of Congress.\" Id., at 383.~    ~    ~      17~      The Court's references to \"process\" in Utah  Northern R. Co. and Kagama, and the Court's concern in Kagama over possible federal encroachment on state prerogatives, suggest state authority to issue search warrants in cases such as the one before us. (\"Process\" is defined as \"any means used by a court to acquire or exercise its jurisdiction over a person or over specific property,\" Black's Law Dictionary 1084 (5th ed. 1979), and is equated in criminal cases with a warrant, id., at 1085.) It is noteworthy that Kagama recognized the right of state laws to \"operat[e]   upon [non-Indians] found\" within a reservation, but did not similarly limit to non-Indians or the property of non-Indians the scope of the process of state courts. This makes perfect sense, since, as we explained in the context of federal enclaves, the reservation of state authority to serve process is necessary to \"prevent [such areas] from becoming an asylum for fugitives from justice.\" Fort Leavenworth R. Co. v. Lowe, 114 U.S. 525, 533 (1885).6~    ~    ~      18~      We conclude today, in accordance with these prior statements, that tribal authority to regulate state officers in executing process related to the violation, off reservation, of state laws is not essential to tribal self-government or internal relations to \"the right to make laws and be ruled by them.\" The State's interest in execution of process is considerable, and even when it relates to Indian-fee lands it no more impairs the tribe's self-government than federal enforcement of federal law impairs state government. Respondents argue that, even conceding the State's general interest in enforcing its off-reservation poaching law on the reservation, Nevada's interest in this suit is minimal, because it is a suit against state officials in their individual capacities. We think, however, that the distinction between individual and official capacity suits is irrelevant. To paraphrase our opinion in Tennessee v. Davis, 100 U.S. 257, 263 (1880), which upheld a federal statute permitting federal officers to remove to federal court state criminal proceedings brought against them for their official actions, a State \"can act only through its officers and agents,\" and if a tribe can \"affix penalties to acts done under the immediate direction of the [state] government, and in obedience to its laws,\" \"the operations of the [state] government may at any time be arrested at the will of the [tribe].\" Cf. Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 638 (1987) (\"Permitting damages suits against government officials can entail substantial social costs, including the risk that fear of personal monetary liability and harassing litigation will unduly inhibit officials in the discharge of their duties\").~    ~    C~    ~      19~      The States' inherent jurisdiction on reservations can of course be stripped by Congress, see Draper v. United States, 164 U.S. 240, 242-243 (1896). But with regard to the jurisdiction at issue here that has not occurred. The Government's assertion that \"[a]s a general matter, although state officials have jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute crimes on a reservation that exclusively involve non-Indians, . . . they do not have jurisdiction with respect to crimes involving Indian perpetrators or Indian victims,\" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12-13, n. 7, is misleading. The statutes upon which it relies, see id., at 18-19 show that the last half of the statement, like the first, is limited to \"crimes on a reservation.\" Sections 1152 and 1153 of Title 18, which give United States and tribal criminal law generally exclusive application, apply only to crimes committed in Indian Country; Public Law 280, codified at 18 U.S.C.  1162 which permits some state jurisdiction as an exception to this rule, is similarly limited. And 25 U.S.C.  2804 which permits federal-state agreements enabling state law-enforcement agents to act on reservations, applies only to deputizing them for the enforcement of federal or tribal criminal law. Nothing in the federal statutory scheme prescribes, or even remotely suggests, that state officers cannot enter a reservation (including Indian-fee land) to investigate or prosecute violations of state law occurring off the reservation. To the contrary, 25 U.S.C.  2806 affirms that \"the provisions of this chapter alter neither . . . the law enforcement, investigative, or judicial authority of any . . . State, or political subdivision or agency thereof . . . .\"~    ~    III~    ~      20~      We turn next to the contention of respondent and the Government that the tribal court, as a court of general jurisdiction, has authority to entertain federal claims under 1983.(FN7 It is certainly true that state courts of \"general jurisdiction\" can adjudicate cases invoking federal statutes, such as 1983, absent congressional specification to the contrary. \"Under [our] system of dual sovereignty, we have consistently held that state courts have inherent authority, and are thus presumptively competent, to adjudicate claims arising under the laws of the United States,\" Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U.S. 455, 458 (1990). That this would be the case was assumed by the Framers, see The Federalist No. 82, pp. 492-493 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). Indeed, that state courts could enforce federal law is presumed by Article III of the Constitution, which leaves to Congress the decision whether to create lower federal courts at all. This historical and constitutional assumption of concurrent state-court jurisdiction over federal-law cases is completely missing with respect to tribal courts.~    ~    ~      21~      Respondents' contention that tribal courts are courts of \"general jurisdiction\" is also quite wrong. A state court's jurisdiction is general, in that it \"lays hold of all subjects of litigation between parties within its jurisdiction, though the causes of dispute are relative to the laws of the most distant part of the globe.\" Id., at 493. Tribal courts, it should be clear, cannot be courts of general jurisdiction in this sense, for a tribe's inherent adjudicative jurisdiction over nonmembers is at most only as broad as its legislative jurisdiction. See supra, at 3-4.(FN8 It is true that some statutes proclaim tribal-court jurisdiction over certain questions of federal law. See, e.g., 25 U.S.C.  1911(a) (authority to adjudicate child custody disputes under the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978); 12 U.S.C.  1715z-13(g)(5) (jurisdiction over mortgage foreclosure actions brought by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development against reservation homeowners). But no provision in federal law provides for tribal-court jurisdiction over 1983 actions.~    ~    ~      22~      Furthermore, tribal-court jurisdiction would create serious anomalies, as the Government recognizes, because the general federal-question removal statute refers only to removal from state court, see 28 U.S.C.  1441. Were 1983 claims cognizable in tribal court, defendants would inexplicably lack the right available to state-court 1983 defendants to seek a federal forum. The Government thinks the omission of reference to tribal courts in 1441 unproblematic. Since, it argues, \"[i]t is doubtful . . . that Congress intended to deny tribal court defendants the right given state court defendants to elect a federal forum for the adjudication of causes of action under federal law,\" we should feel free to create that right by permitting the tribal-court defendant to obtain a federal-court injunction against the action, effectively forcing it to be refiled in federal court. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25-26. The sole support for devising this extraordinary remedy is El Paso Natural Gas Co. v. Neztsosie, 526 U.S. 473 (1999), where we approved a similar procedure with regard to claims under the Price-Anderson Act brought in tribal court. In Neztsosie, however, the claims were not initially federal claims, but Navajo tort claims that the Price-Anderson Act provided \"shall be deemed to be . . . action[s] arising under\"42 U.S.C.  2210; there was little doubt that the tribal court had jurisdiction over such tort claims, see id., at 482, n. 4. And for the propriety of the injunction in Neztsosie, we relied not on 1441, but on the removal provision of the Price-Anderson Act, 42 U.S.C.  2210(n)(2). Although, like 1441, that provision referred only to removal from state courts, in light of the Act's detailed and distinctive provisions for the handling of \"nuclear incident\" cases in federal court, see 526 U.S., at 486, we thought it clear Congress envisioned the defendant's ability to get into federal court in all instances. Not only are there missing here any distinctive federal-court procedures, but in order even to confront the question whether an unspecified removal power exists, we must first attribute to tribal courts jurisdiction that is not apparent. Surely the simpler way to avoid the removal problem is to conclude (as other indications suggest anyway) that tribal courts cannot entertain 1983 suits.~    ~    IV~    ~      23~      The last question before us is whether petitioners were required to exhaust their jurisdictional claims in Tribal Court before bringing them in Federal District Court. See National Farmers Union Ins. Cos. v. Crow Tribe, 471 U.S. 845, 856-857 (1985). In National Farmers Union we recognized exceptions to the exhaustion requirement, where \"an assertion of tribal jurisdiction is motivated by a desire to harass or is conducted in bad faith, . . . or where the action is patently violative of express jurisdictional prohibitions, or where exhaustion would be futile because of the lack of an adequate opportunity to challenge the court's jurisdiction,\" id., at 856, n. 21 (internal quotation marks omitted). None of these exceptions seems applicable to this case, but we added a broader exception in Strate: \"[w]hen . . . it is plain that no federal grant provides for tribal governance of nonmembers' conduct on land covered by Montana's main rule,\" so the exhaustion requirement \"would serve no purpose other than delay.\" 520 U.S., at 459-460, and n. 14. Though this exception too is technically inapplicable, the reasoning behind it is not. Since it is clear, as we have discussed, that tribal courts lack jurisdiction over state officials for causes of action relating to their performance of official duties, adherence to the tribal exhaustion requirement in such cases \"would serve no purpose other than delay,\" and is therefore unnecessary.~    ~    V~    ~      24~      Finally, a few words in response to the concurring opinion of Justice O'Connor, which is in large part a dissent from the views expressed in this opinion.9~    ~    ~      25~      The principal point of the concurrence is that our reasoning \"gives only passing consideration to the fact that the state officials' activities in this case occurred on land owned and controlled by the Tribe,\" post, at 6. According to Justice O'Connor, \"that factor is not prominent in the Court's analysis,\" post, at 9. Even a cursory reading of our opinion demonstrates that this is not so. To the contrary, we acknowledge that tribal ownership is a factor in the Montana analysis, and a factor significant enough that it \"may sometimes be . . . dispositive,\" supra, at 6. We simply do not find it dispositive in the present case, when weighed against the State's interest in pursuing off-reservation violations of its laws. See supra, at 10 (concluding that \"[t]he State's interest in execution of process is considerable\" enough to outweigh the tribal interest in self-government \"even when it relates to Indian-fee lands\"). The concurrence is of course free to disagree with this judgment; but to say that failure to give tribal ownership determinative effect \"fails to consider adequately the Tribe's inherent sovereign interests in activities on their land,\" post, at 16 (opinion of O'Connor, J.), is an exaggeration.~    ~    ~      26~      The concurrence marshals no authority and scant reasoning to support its judgment that tribal authority over state officers pursuing, on tribe-owned land, off-reservation violations of state law may be \"necessary to protect tribal self-government or to control internal relations.\" Montana, 450 U.S., at 564-565. Self-government and internal relations are not directly at issue here, since the issue is whether the Tribes' law will apply, not to their own members, but to a narrow category of outsiders. And the concurrence does not try to explain how allowing state officers to pursue off-reservation violation of state law \"threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe,\" id., at 566. That the actions of these state officers cannot threaten or affect those interests is guaranteed by the limitations of federal constitutional and statutory law to which the officers are fully subject.~    ~    ~      27~      The concurrence exaggerates and distorts the consequences of our conclusion, supra, at 5, n. 3, that the term \"other arrangements\" in a passage from Montana referred to other \"private consensual\" arrangements so that it did not include the state officials' obtaining of tribal warrants in the present case. That conclusion is correct, as a fuller exposition of the passage from Montana makes clear:~    ~    ~      28~      \"To be sure, Indian tribes retain inherent sovereign power to exercise some forms of civil jurisdiction over non-Indians on their reservations, even on non-Indian fee lands. A tribe may regulate, through taxation, licensing, or other means, the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members, through commercial dealing, contracts, leases, or other arrangements.\" 450 U.S., at 565.~    ~    ~      29~      The Court (this is an opinion, bear in mind, not a statute) obviously did not have in mind States or state officers acting in their governmental capacity; it was referring to private individuals who voluntarily submitted themselves to tribal regulatory jurisdiction by the arrangements that they (or their employers) entered into. This is confirmed by the fact that all four of the cases in the immediately following citation involved private commercial actors. See Confederated Tribes, 447 U.S., at 152 (nonmember purchasers of cigarettes from tribal outlet); Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S., at 217 (general store on the Navajo reservation); Morris v. Hitchcock, 194 U.S. 384 (1904) (ranchers grazing livestock and horses on Indian lands \"under contracts with individual members of said tribes\"); Buster v. Wright, 135 F. 947, 950 (CA8 1905) (challenge to the \"permit tax\" charged by a tribe to nonmembers for \"the privilege . . . of trading within the borders\").~    ~    ~      30~      The concurrence concludes from this brief footnote discussion that we would invalidate express or implied cessions of regulatory authority over nonmembers contained in state-tribal cooperative agreements, including those pertaining to mutual law-enforcement assistance, tax administration assistance, and child support and paternity matters. See post, at 7-8 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). This is a great overreaching. The footnote does not assert that \"a consensual relationship [between a tribe and a State] could never exist,\" post, at 8 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). It merely asserts that \"other arrangements\" in the passage from Montana does not include state officers' obtaining of an (unnecessary) tribal warrant. Whether contractual relations between State and tribe can expressly or impliedly confer tribal regulatory jurisdiction over nonmembers and whether such conferral can be effective to confer adjudicative jurisdiction as well are questions that may arise in another case, but are not at issue here.~    ~    ~      31~      Another exaggeration is the concurrence's contention that we \"give nonmembers freedom to act with impunity on tribal land based solely on their status as state law enforcement officials,\" post, at 16 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). We do not say state officers cannot be regulated; we say they cannot be regulated in the performance of their law-enforcement duties. Action unrelated to that is potentially subject to tribal control depending on the outcome of Montana analysis. Moreover, even where the issue is whether the officer has acted unlawfully in the performance of his duties, the tribe and tribe members are of course able to invoke the authority of the Federal Government and federal courts (or the state government and state courts) to vindicate constitutional or other federal- and state-law rights.~    ~    ~      32~      We must comment upon the final paragraphs of Part II of the concurrence's opinion which bring on stage, in classic fashion, a deus ex machina to extract, from the seemingly insoluble difficulties that the prior writing has created, a happy ending. The concurrence manages to have its cake and eat it too to hand over state law-enforcement officers to the jurisdiction of tribal courts and yet still assure that the officers' traditional immunity (and hence the State's law-enforcement interest) will be protected by simply announcing \"that in order to protect government officials, immunity defenses should be considered in reviewing tribal court jurisdiction.\" Post, at 16 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). What wonderful magic. Without so much as a citation (none is available) the concurrence declares the qualified immunity inquiry to be part of the jurisdictional inquiry, thus bringing it within the ken of the federal court at the outset of the case. There are two problems with this declaration. The first is that it is not true. There is no authority whatever for the proposition that absolute- and qualified-immunity defenses pertain to the court's jurisdiction much less to the tribe's regulatory jurisdiction, which is what is at issue here. (If they did pertain to the court's jurisdiction, they would presumably be nonwaivable. Cf. Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U.S. 261, 267 (1997)). And the second problem is, that without first determining whether the tribe has regulatory jurisdiction, it is impossible to know which \"immunity defenses\" the federal court is supposed to consider. The tribe's law on this subject need not be the same as the State's; indeed, the tribe may decide (as did the common law until relatively recently) that there is no immunity defense whatever without a warrant. See California v. Acevedo, 500 U.S. 565, 581 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). One wonders whether, deprived of its deus ex machina, the concurrence would not alter the conclusion it reached in Part I of its opinion, and agree with us that a proper balancing of state and tribal interests would give the Tribes no jurisdiction over state officers pursuing off-reservation violations of state law.~    ~    ~      33~      Finally, it is worth observing that the concurrence's resolution would, for the first time, hold a non-Indian subject to the jurisdiction of a tribal court. The question (which we have avoided) whether tribal regulatory and adjudicatory jurisdiction are coextensive is simply answered by the concurrence in the affirmative. As Justice Souter's separate opinion demonstrates, it surely deserves more considered analysis.~    ~    ~      34~      * * *~    ~    ~      35~      Because the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribes lacked legislative authority to restrict, condition, or otherwise regulate the ability of state officials to investigate off-reservation violations of state law, they also lacked adjudicative authority to hear respondent's claim that those officials violated tribal law in the performance of their duties. Nor can the Tribes identify any authority to adjudicate respondent's 1983 claim. And since the lack of authority is clear, there is no need to exhaust the jurisdictional dispute in tribal court. State officials operating on a reservation to investigate off-reservation violations of state law are properly held accountable for tortious conduct and civil rights violations in either state or federal court, but not in tribal court.~    ~    ~      36~      The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.~    ~    ~      37~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      38~      Souter, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Kennedy and Thomas, JJ., joined.~    ~    ~      39~      Ginsburg, J., filed a concurring opinion.~    ~    ~      40~      O'Connor, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, in which Stevens and Breyer, JJ., joined.~    ~    ~      41~      Stevens, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Breyer, J., joined.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~          Hereinafter, Hicks will be referred to as \"respondent.\" The Tribal Court and Judge are also respondents, however, and are included when the term \"respondents\" is used.~      ~      ~        2~          In National Farmers Union Ins. Cos. v. Crow Tribe, 471 U.S. 845, 855-856 (1985), we avoided the question whether tribes may generally adjudicate against nonmembers claims arising from on-reservation transactions, and we have never held that a tribal court had jurisdiction over a nonmember defendant. Typically, our cases have involved claims brought against tribal defendants. See, e.g., Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S. 217 (1959). In Strate v. A-1 Contractors, 520 U.S. 438, 453 (1997), however, we assumed that \"where tribes possess authority to regulate the activities of nonmembers, civil jurisdiction over disputes arising out of such activities presumably lies in the tribal courts,\" without distinguishing between nonmember plaintiffs and nonmember defendants. See also Iowa Mut. Ins. Co. v. LaPlante, 480 U.S. 9, 18 (1987). Our holding in this case is limited to the question of tribal-court jurisdiction over state officers enforcing state law. We leave open the question of tribal-court jurisdiction over nonmember defendants in general.~      ~      ~        3~          Montana recognized an exception to this rule for tribal regulation of \"the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members, through commercial dealing, contracts, leases, or other arrangements.\" 450 U.S., at 565. Though the wardens in this case \"consensually\" obtained a warrant from the Tribal Court before searching respondent's home and yard, we do not think this qualifies as an \"other arrangement\" within the meaning of this passage. Read in context, an \"other arrangement\" is clearly another private consensual relationship, from which the official actions at issue in this case are far removed.~      ~      ~        4~          Our holding in Worcester must be considered in light of the fact that \"[t]he 1828 treaty with the Cherokee nation . . . guaranteed the Indians their lands would never be subjected to the jurisdiction of any State or Territory.\" Organized Village of Kake v. Egan, 369 U.S. 60, 71 (1962); cf. Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S. 217, 221-222 (1959) (comparing Navajo treaty to the Cherokee treaty in Worcester).~      ~      ~        5~          Though Utah  Northern R. Co. did not state what it meant by a \"reservation of this kind,\" the context makes clear that it meant a reservation not excluded from the territory of a State by treaty. See, e.g., Harkness v. Hyde, 98 U.S. 476, 478 (1879); The Kansas Indians, 5 Wall. 737, 739-741 (1867).~      ~      ~        6~          That this risk is not purely hypothetical is demonstrated by Arizona ex rel. Merrill v. Turtle, 413 F.2d 683 (CA9 1969), a case in which the Navajo Tribal Court refused to extradite a member to Oklahoma because tribal law forbade extradition except to three neighboring States. The Ninth Circuit held that Arizona (where the reservation was located) could not enter the reservation to seize the suspect for extradition since (among other reasons) this would interfere with tribal self-government, id., at 685-686.~      ~      ~        7~          Justice Stevens questions why it is necessary to consider tribal-court jurisdiction over 1983 claims, since we have already determined that \"tribal courts lack . . . jurisdiction over 'state wardens executing a search warrant for evidence of an off-reservation crime,' \" post, at 1, n. 1. It is because the latter determination is based upon Strate's holding that tribal-court jurisdiction does not exceed tribal regulatory jurisdiction; and because that holding contained a significant qualifier: \"[a]bsent congressional direction enlarging [tribal-court jurisdiction],\" 520 U.S., at 453. We conclude (as we must) that 1983 is not such an enlargement.~      ~      ~        8~          Justice Stevens argues that \"[a]bsent federal law to the contrary, the question whether tribal courts are courts of general jurisdiction is fundamentally a question of tribal law.\" Post, at 2 (emphasis omitted). The point of our earlier discussion is that Strate is \"federal law to the contrary.\" Justice Stevens thinks Strate cannot fill that role, because it \"merely concerned the circumstances under which tribal courts can exert jurisdiction over claims against nonmembers,\" post, at 2-3, n. 3. But Strate's limitation on jurisdiction over nonmembers pertains to subject-matter, rather than merely personal, jurisdiction, since it turns upon whether the actions at issue in the litigation are regulable by the tribe. One can of course say that even courts of limited subject-matter jurisdiction have general jurisdiction over those subjects that they can adjudicate (in the present case, jurisdiction over claims pertaining to activities by nonmembers that can be regulated) but that makes the concept of general jurisdiction meaningless, and is assuredly not the criterion that would determine whether these courts received authority to adjudicate 1983 actions.~      ~      ~        9~          Justice O'Connor claims we have gone beyond the scope of the Questions Presented in this case by determining whether the tribe could regulate the state game warden's actions on tribal land, because this is a case about tribal \"civil adjudicatory authority.\" See post, at 12. But the third Question Presented, see Petn. for Writ of Certiorari i, is as follows: \"Is the rule of [Montana], creating a presumption against tribal court jurisdiction over nonmembers, limited to cases in which a cause of action against a nonmember arises on lands within a reservation which are not controlled by the tribe?\" Montana dealt only with regulatory authority, and is tied to adjudicatory authority by Strate, which held that the latter at best tracks the former. As is made clear in the merits briefing, petitioners' argument is that the Tribes lacked adjudicatory authority because they lacked regulatory authority over the game wardens. See Brief for Petitioners 36-44.~      ~    ~    ~      42~      Justice Souter, with whom Justices Kennedy and Thomas join, concurring.~    ~    ~      43~      I agree that the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribal Court had no jurisdiction to entertain Hicks's claims against the petitioning state officers here, and I join the Court's opinion. While I agree with the Court's analysis as well as its conclusion, I would reach that point by a different route. Like the Court, I take Montana v. United States, 450 U.S. 544 (1981), to be the source of the first principle on tribal-court civil jurisdiction, see Atkinson Trading Co. v. Shirley, 532 U.S. ___, ___ (2001) (Souter, J., concurring). But while the Court gives emphasis to measuring tribal authority here in light of the State's interest in executing its own legal process to enforce state law governing off-reservation conduct, ante, at 6-11, I would go right to Montana's rule that a tribe's civil jurisdiction generally stops short of nonmember defendants, 450 U.S., at 565, subject only to two exceptions, one turning on \"consensual relationships,\" the other on respect for \"the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe,\" id., at 566.1~    ~    ~      44~      Montana applied this presumption against tribal jurisdiction to nonmember conduct on fee land within a reservation; I would also apply it where, as here, a nonmember acts on tribal or trust land, and I would thus make it explicit that land status within a reservation is not a primary jurisdictional fact, but is relevant only insofar as it bears on the application of one of Montana's exceptions to a particular case. Insofar as I rest my conclusion on the general jurisdictional presumption, it follows for me that, although the holding in this case is \"limited to the question of tribal-court jurisdiction over state officers enforcing state law,\" ante, at 4, n. 2, one rule independently supporting that holding (that as a general matter \"the inherent sovereign powers of an Indian tribe do not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe,\" ante, at 5) is not so confined.~    ~    ~      45~      * Petitioners are certainly correct that \"[t]ribal adjudicatory jurisdiction over nonmembers is   ill-defined,\" Reply Brief for Petitioners 16, since this Court's own pronouncements on the issue have pointed in seemingly opposite directions. Compare, e.g., Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49, 65 (1978) (\"Tribal courts have repeatedly been recognized as appropriate forums for the exclusive adjudication of disputes affecting important personal and property interests of both Indians and non-Indians\"), and United States v. Mazurie, 419 U.S. 544, 557 (1975) (\"Indian tribes are unique aggregations possessing attributes of sovereignty over both their members and their territory\"), with, e.g., Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe, 435 U.S. 191, 209 (1978) (\" '[T]he limitation upon [tribes'] sovereignty amounts to the right of governing every person within their limits except themselves' \") (quoting Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 147 (1810))). Oliphant, however, clarified tribal-courts' criminal jurisdiction (in holding that they had none as to non-Indians), and that decision is now seen as a significant step on the way to Montana, \"the pathmarking case concerning tribal civil authority over nonmembers,\" Strate v. A-1 Contractors, 520 U.S. 438, 445 (1997). The path marked best is the rule that, at least as a presumptive matter, tribal courts lack civil jurisdiction over nonmembers.2~    ~    ~      46~      To be sure, Montana does not of its own force resolve the jurisdictional issue in this case. There, while recognizing that the parties had \"raised broad questions about the power of the Tribe to regulate [the conduct of] non-Indians on the reservation,\" we noted that the issue before us was a \"narrow one.\" 450 U.S., at 557. Specifically, we said, the question presented concerned only the power of an Indian tribe to regulate the conduct of nonmembers \"on reservation land owned in fee by nonmembers of the Tribe.\" Ibid. Here, it is undisputed, the acts complained of occurred on reservation land \"controlled by a tribe.\" Pet. for Cert. 24. But although the distinction between tribal and fee land (and, accordingly, between Montana and this case) surely exists, it does not in my mind call for a different result. I see the legal principles that animated our presumptive preclusion of tribal jurisdiction in Montana as counseling a similar rule as to regulatory, and hence adjudicatory, jurisdiction here.~    ~    ~      47~      In Montana, the Court began its discussion of tribes' \"inherent authority\" by noting that \"the Indian tribes have lost many of the attributes of sovereignty.\" 450 U.S., at 563. In \"distinguish[ing] between those inherent powers retained by the tribe and those divested,\" id., at 564, the Court relied on a portion of the opinion in United States v. Wheeler, 435 U.S. 313, 326 (1978), from which it quoted at length:~    ~    ~      48~      \" 'The areas in which   implicit divestiture of sovereignty has been held to have occurred are those involving the relations between an Indian tribe and nonmembers of the tribe  .    These limitations rest on the fact that the dependent status of Indian tribes within our territorial jurisdiction is necessarily inconsistent with their freedom independently to determine their external relations. But the powers of self-government, including the power to prescribe and enforce internal criminal laws, are of a different type. They involve only the relations among members of a tribe. Thus, they are not such powers as would necessarily be lost by virtue of a tribe's dependent status.' \" Montana, supra, at 564.~    ~    ~      49~      The emphasis in these passages (supplied by the Montana Court, not by me) underscores the distinction between tribal members and nonmembers, and seems clearly to indicate, without restriction to the criminal law, that the inherent authority of the tribes has been preserved over the former but not the latter. In fact, after quoting Wheeler, the Court invoked Oliphant, supra, which (as already noted) had imposed a per se bar to tribal-court criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians, even with respect to conduct occurring on tribal land. The Montana Court remarked that, \"[t]hough Oliphant only determined inherent tribal authority in criminal matters, the principles on which it relied\" support a more \"general proposition\" applicable in civil cases as well, namely, that \"the inherent sovereign powers of an Indian tribe do not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe.\" 450 U.S., at 565. Accordingly, the Court in Montana repeatedly pressed the member-nonmember distinction, reiterating at one point, for example, that while \"the Indian tribes retain their inherent power to determine tribal membership, to regulate domestic relations among members, and to prescribe rules of inheritance for members,\" the \"exercise of tribal power beyond what is necessary to protect tribal self-government or to control internal relations is inconsistent with the dependent status of the tribes, and so cannot survive without express congressional delegation.\" Id., at 564; cf. Oliphant v. Schlie, 544 F.2d 1007, 1015 (CA9 1976) (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (\"The concept of sovereignty applicable to Indian tribes need not include the power to prosecute nonmembers. This power, unlike the ability to maintain law and order on the reservation and to exclude nondesireable nonmembers, is not essential to the tribe's identity or its self-governing status\"), rev'd sub nom. Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe, 435 U.S. 191 (1978).~    ~    ~      50~      To Montana's \"general proposition\" confining the subjects of tribal jurisdiction to tribal members, the Court appended two exceptions that could support tribal jurisdiction in some civil matters. First, a tribe may \"regulate   the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members, through commercial dealing, contracts, leases, or other arrangements.\" And second, a tribe may regulate nonmember conduct that \"threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe.\" Id., at 565-566.3 But unless one of these exceptions applies, the \"general proposition\" governs and the tribe's civil jurisdiction does \"not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe.\"~    ~    ~      51~      In Strate, we expressly extended the Montana framework, originally applied as a measure of tribes' civil regulatory jurisdiction, to limit tribes' civil adjudicatory jurisdiction. We repeated that \"absent express authorization by federal statute or treaty, tribal jurisdiction over the conduct of nonmembers exists only in limited circumstances.\" 520 U.S., at 445. Quoting Montana, we further explained that \"[i]n the main\" (that is, subject to the two exceptions outlined in the Montana opinion), \" 'the inherent sovereign powers of an Indian tribe' those powers a tribe enjoys apart from express provision by treaty or statute 'do not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe.' \" Id., at 445-446. Equally important for purposes here was our treatment of the following passage from Iowa Mut. Ins. Co. v. LaPlante, 480 U.S. 9 (1987), which seemed to state a more expansive jurisdictional position and which had been cited by the Tribal Court in Strate in support of broad tribal-court civil jurisdiction over nonmembers:~    ~    ~      52~      \"Tribal authority over the activities of non-Indians on reservation lands is an important part of tribal sovereignty. See Montana v. United States, 450 U.S. 544, 565-566 (1981); Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Indian Reservation, 447 U.S. 134, 152-153 (1980); Fisher v. District Court [of Sixteenth Judicial Dist. of Mont.], 424 U.S. [382,] 387-389 [(1976)]. Civil jurisdiction over such activities presumptively lies in the tribal courts unless affirmatively limited by a specific treaty provision or federal statute   .' \" Id., at 18.\" Strate, supra, at 452.~    ~    ~      53~      The Strate petitioners fastened upon the statement that \"civil jurisdiction over\" the activities of nonmembers on reservation lands \"presumptively lies in the tribal courts.\" But we resisted the overbreadth of the Iowa Mutual dictum. We said that the passage \"scarcely supports the view that the Montana rule does not bear on tribal-court adjudicatory authority in cases involving nonmember defendants,\" 520 U.S., at 451-452, and stressed the \"three informative citations\" accompanying the statement, which mark the true contours of inherent tribal authority over nonmembers:~    ~    ~      54~      \"The first citation points to the passage in Montana in which the Court advanced 'the general proposition that the inherent sovereign powers of an Indian tribe do not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe,' with two prime exceptions. The case cited second is Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation, a decision the Montana Court listed as illustrative of the first Montana exception   . The third case noted in conjunction with the Iowa Mutual statement is Fisher v. District Court of Sixteenth Judicial Dist. of Mont., a decision the Montana Court cited in support of the second Montana exception   .\" Strate, supra, at 452 (citations omitted).Accordingly, in explaining and distinguishing Iowa Mutual, we confirmed in Strate what we had indicated in Montana: that as a general matter, a tribe's civil jurisdiction does not extend to the \"activities of non-Indians on reservation lands,\" Iowa Mutual, supra, at 18, and that the only such activities that trigger civil jurisdiction are those that fit within one of Montana's two exceptions.~    ~    ~      55~      After Strate, it is undeniable that a tribe's remaining inherent civil jurisdiction to adjudicate civil claims arising out of acts committed on a reservation depends in the first instance on the character of the individual over whom jurisdiction is claimed, not on the title to the soil on which he acted. The principle on which Montana and Strate were decided (like Oliphant before them) looks first to human relationships, not land records, and it should make no difference per se whether acts committed on a reservation occurred on tribal land or on land owned by a nonmember individual in fee. It is the membership status of the unconsenting party, not the status of real property, that counts as the primary jurisdictional fact.4~    ~    II~    ~      56~      Limiting tribal-court civil jurisdiction this way not only applies the animating principle behind our precedents, but fits with historical assumptions about tribal authority and serves sound policy. As for history, Justice Stevens has observed that \"[i]n sharp contrast to the tribes' broad powers over their own members, tribal powers over nonmembers have always been narrowly confined.\" Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U.S. 130, 171 (1982) (dissenting opinion). His point is exemplified by the early treaties with those who became known as the five civilized Tribes, which treaties \"specifically granted the right of self-government to the tribes [but] specifically excluded jurisdiction over nonmembers.\" Id., at 171, n. 21 (citing Treaty with the Cherokees, Art. 5, 7 Stat. 481 (1835), Treaty with the Choctaws and Chickasaws, Art. 7, 11 Stat. 612 (1855), and Treaty with the Creeks and Seminoles, Art. 15, 11 Stat. 703 (1856)). In a similar vein, referring to 19th-century federal statutes setting the jurisdiction of the courts of those five Tribes, this Court said in In re Mayfield, 141 U.S. 107, 116 (1891), that the \"general object\" of such measures was \"to vest in the courts of the [Indian] nation jurisdiction of all controversies between Indians, or where a member of the nation is the only party to the proceeding, and to reserve to the courts of the United States jurisdiction of all actions to which its own citizens are parties on either side.\" And, in fact, to this very day, general federal law prohibits Courts of Indian Offenses (tribunals established by regulation for tribes that have not organized their own tribal court systems) from exercising jurisdiction over unconsenting nonmembers. Such courts have \"[c]ivil jurisdiction\" only of those actions arising within their territory \"in which the defendant is an Indian, and of all other suits between Indians and non-Indians which are brought before the court by stipulation of the parties.\" 25 CFR  11.103(a) (2000).~    ~    ~      57~      A rule generally prohibiting tribal courts from exercising civil jurisdiction over nonmembers, without looking first to the status of the land on which individual claims arise, also makes sense from a practical standpoint, for tying tribes' authority to land status in the first instance would produce an unstable jurisdictional crazy quilt. Because land on Indian reservations constantly changes hands (from tribes to nonmembers, from nonmembers to tribal members, and so on), a jurisdictional rule under which land status was dispositive would prove extraordinarily difficult to administer and would provide little notice to nonmembers, whose susceptibility to tribal-court jurisdiction would turn on the most recent property conveyances. Cf. Hodel v. Irving, 481 U.S. 704, 718 (1987) (noting the difficulties that attend the \"extreme fractionation of Indian lands\").~    ~    ~      58~      The ability of nonmembers to know where tribal jurisdiction begins and ends, it should be stressed, is a matter of real, practical consequence given \"[t]he special nature of [Indian] tribunals,\" Duro v. Reina, 495 U.S. 676, 693 (1990), which differ from traditional American courts in a number of significant respects. To start with the most obvious one, it has been understood for more than a century that the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment do not of their own force apply to Indian tribes. See Talton v. Mayes, 163 U.S. 376, 382-385 (1895); F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 664-665 (1982 ed.) (hereinafter Cohen) (\"Indian tribes are not states of the union within the meaning of the Constitution, and the constitutional limitations on states do not apply to tribes\"). Although the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 (ICRA) makes a handful of analogous safeguards enforceable in tribal courts, 25 U.S.C.  1302 \"the guarantees are not identical,\" Oliphant, 435 U.S., at 194,5 and there is a \"definite trend by tribal courts\" toward the view that they \"ha[ve] leeway in interpreting\" the ICRA's due process and equal protection clauses and \"need not follow the U.S. Supreme Court precedents 'jot-for-jot,' \" Newton, Tribal Court Praxis: One Year in the Life of Twenty Indian Tribal Courts, 22 Am. Indian L. Rev. 285, 344, n. 238 (1998). In any event, a presumption against tribal-court civil jurisdiction squares with one of the principal policy considerations underlying Oliphant, namely, an overriding concern that citizens who are not tribal members be \"protected   from unwarranted intrusions on their personal liberty,\" 435 U.S., at 210.~    ~    ~      59~      Tribal courts also differ from other American courts (and often from one another) in their structure, in the substantive law they apply, and in the independence of their judges. Although some modern tribal courts \"mirror American courts\" and \"are guided by written codes, rules, procedures, and guidelines,\" tribal law is still frequently unwritten, being based instead \"on the values, mores, and norms of a tribe and expressed in its customs, traditions, and practices,\" and is often \"handed down orally or by example from one generation to another.\" Melton, Indigenous Justice Systems and Tribal Society, 79 Judicature 126, 130-131 (1995). The resulting law applicable in tribal courts is a complex \"mix of tribal codes and federal, state, and traditional law,\" National American Indian Court Judges Assn., Indian Courts and the Future 43 (1978), which would be unusually difficult for an outsider to sort out.~    ~    ~      60~      Hence the practical importance of being able to anticipate tribal jurisdiction by reference to a fact more readily knowable than the title status of a particular plot of land. One further consideration confirms the point. It is generally accepted that there is no effective review mechanism in place to police tribal courts' decisions on matters of non-tribal law, since tribal-court judgments based on state or federal law can be neither removed nor appealed to state or federal courts. Cf., e.g., 28 U.S.C.  1441(a) (removal of \"any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction\"); 1257(a) (Supreme Court review of \"judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State\" where federal law implicated). The result, of course, is a risk of substantial disuniformity in the interpretation of state and federal law, a risk underscored by the fact that \"[t]ribal courts are often 'subordinate to the political branches of tribal governments,' \" Duro, supra, at 693 (quoting Cohen 334-335).~    ~    III~    ~      61~      There is one loose end. The panel majority in the Ninth Circuit held that \"the Montana presumption against tribal court jurisdiction does not apply in this case.\" 196 F.3d 1020, 1028 (1999). Since we have held otherwise, should we now remand for application of the correct law? There is room for reasonable disagreement on this point, see post, at 10 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), but on balance I think a remand is unnecessary. The Court's analysis of opposing state and tribal interests answers the opinion of the Ninth Circuit majority; in substance, the issues subject to the Court of Appeals's principal concern have been considered here. My own focus on the Montana presumption was, of course, addressed by the panel (albeit unsympathetically), and the only question that might now be considered by the Circuit on my separate approach to the case is the applicability of the second Montana exception. But as Judge Rymer indicated in her dissent, the uncontested fact that the Tribal Court itself authorized service of the state warrant here bars any serious contention that the execution of that warrant adversely affected the Tribes' political integrity. See 196 F.3d, at 1033-1034. Thus, even if my alternative rationale exclusively governed the outcome, remand would be pure formality.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~          The virtue of the Court's approach is in laying down a rule that would be unquestionably applicable even if in a future case the state officials issuing and executing state process happened to be tribal members (which they apparently are not here).~      ~      ~        2~          The Court in Montana v. United States, 450 U.S. 544 (1981), referred to \"nonmembers\" and \"non-Indians\" interchangeably. In response to our decision in Duro v. Reina, 495 U.S. 676 (1990), in which we extended the rule of Oliphant to deny tribal courts criminal jurisdiction over nonmember Indians (i.e., Indians who are members of other tribes), Congress passed a statute expressly granting tribal courts such jurisdiction, see 105 Stat. 646, 25 U.S.C.  1301(2). Because, here, we are concerned with the extent of tribes' inherent authority, and not with the jurisdiction statutorily conferred on them by Congress, the relevant distinction, as we implicitly acknowledged in Strate, is between members and nonmembers of the tribe. In this case, nonmembership means freedom from tribal court jurisdiction, since none of the petitioning state officers is identified as an Indian of any tribe.~      ~      ~        3~          Thus, it is true that tribal courts' \"civil subject-matter jurisdiction over non-Indians   is not automatically foreclosed, as an extension of Oliphant would require.\" National Farmers Union Ins. Co. v. Crow Tribe, 471 U.S. 845, 855 (1985). \"Montana did not extend the full Oliphant rationale to the civil jurisdictional question which would have completely prohibited civil jurisdiction over nonmembers.\" A-1 Contractors v. Strate, 76 F.3d 930, 937 (CA8 1996). Instead, \"the [Montana] Court found that the tribe retained some civil jurisdiction over nonmembers, which the Court went on to describe in the two Montana exceptions.\" Ibid.~      ~      ~        4~          Thus, it is not that land status is irrelevant to a proper Montana calculus, only that it is not determinative in the first instance. Land status, for instance, might well have an impact under one (or perhaps both) of the Montana exceptions. See Atkinson Trading Co. v. Shirley, 532 U.S. ___, ___ (2001) (Souter, J., concurring); cf. White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U.S. 136, 151 (1980) (\"[T]here is a significant geographic component to tribal sovereignty\").~      ~      ~        5~          See also Cohen 667 (\"Many significant constitutional limitations on federal and state governments are not included in the [ICRA]\").~      ~    ~    ~      62~      Justice Ginsburg, concurring.~    ~    ~      63~      I join the Court's opinion. As the Court plainly states, and as Justice Souter recognizes, the \"holding in this case is limited to the question of tribal-court jurisdiction over state officers enforcing state law.\" Ante, at 4, n. 2 (opinion of the Court); ante, at 2 (Souter, J., concurring). The Court's decision explicitly \"leave[s] open the question of tribal-court jurisdiction over nonmember defendants in general,\" ante, at 4, n. 2, including state officials engaged on tribal land in a venture or frolic of their own, see ante, at 19 (a state officer's conduct on tribal land \"unrelated to [performance of his law-enforcement duties] is potentially subject to tribal control\").~    ~    ~      64~      I write separately only to emphasize that Strate v. A-1 Contractors, 520 U.S. 438 (1997), similarly deferred larger issues. Strate concerned a highway accident on a right-of-way over tribal land. For nonmember governance purposes, the accident site was equivalent to alienated, non-Indian land. Id., at 456. We held that the nonmember charged with negligent driving in Strate was not amenable to the Tribe's legislative or adjudicatory authority. But we \"express[ed] no view on the governing law or proper forum\" for cases arising out of nonmember conduct on tribal land. Id., at 442. The Court's opinion, as I understand it, does not reach out definitively to answer the jurisdictional questions left open in Strate.~    ~    ~      65~      Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Stevens and Justice Breyer join, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.~    ~    ~      66~      The Court holds that a tribe has no power to regulate the activities of state officials enforcing state law on land owned and controlled by the tribe. The majority's sweeping opinion, without cause, undermines the authority of tribes to \" 'make their own laws and be ruled by them.' \" Strate v. A-1 Contractors, 520 U.S. 438, 459 (1997) (quoting Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S. 217, 220 (1959)). I write separately because Part II of the Court's decision is unmoored from our precedents.~    ~    ~      67~      * A~    ~    ~      68~      Today, the Court finally resolves that Montana v. United States, 450 U.S. 544 (1981), governs a tribe's civil jurisdiction over nonmembers regardless of land ownership. Ante, at 4-6. This is done with little fanfare, but the holding is significant because we have equivocated on this question in the past.~    ~    ~      69~      In Montana, we held that the Tribe in that case could not regulate the hunting and fishing activities of nonmembers on nontribal land located within the geographical boundaries of the reservation. 450 U.S., at 557. We explained that the Tribe's jurisdiction was limited to two instances where a consensual relationship exists between the tribe and nonmembers, or where jurisdiction was necessary to preserve tribal sovereignty and we concluded that neither instance applied. Id., at 565-567; ante, at 4-6.~    ~    ~      70~      Given the facts of Montana, it was not clear whether the status of the persons being regulated, or the status of the land where the hunting and fishing occurred, led the Court to develop Montana's jurisdictional rule and its exceptions. In subsequent cases, we indicated that the nonmember status of the person being regulated determined Montana's application, see, e.g., South Dakota v. Bourland, 508 U.S. 679, 694-695, and n. 15 (1993), while in other cases we indicated that the fee simple status of the land triggered application of Montana, see, e.g., Strate v. A-1 Contractors, supra, at 454, and n. 8. This is the Court's first opportunity in recent years to consider whether Montana applies to nonmember activity on land owned and controlled by the tribe. Cf. Atkinson Trading Co. v. Shirley, 532 U.S. ___ (2001).~    ~    ~      71~      The Court of Appeals concluded that Montana did not apply in this case because the events in question occurred on tribal land. 196 F.3d 1020, 1028 (CA9 1999). Because Montana is our best source of \"coherence in the various manifestations of the general law of tribal jurisdiction over non-Indians,\" Atkinson Trading Co. v. Shirley, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 1) (Souter, J., concurring), the majority is quite right that Montana should govern our analysis of a tribe's civil jurisdiction over nonmembers both on and off tribal land. I part company with the majority, however, because its reasoning is not faithful to Montana or its progeny.~    ~    B~    ~      72~      Montana's principles bear repeating. In Montana, the Court announced the \"general proposition that the inherent sovereign powers of an Indian tribe do not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe.\" 450 U.S., at 565. The Court further explained, however, that tribes do retain some attributes of sovereignty:~    ~    ~      73~      \"To be sure, Indian tribes retain inherent sovereign power to exercise some forms of civil jurisdiction over non-Indians on their reservations, even on non-Indian fee lands. A tribe may regulate, through taxation, licensing, or other means, the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members, through commercial dealing, contracts, leases, or other arrangements. A tribe may also retain inherent power to exercise civil authority over the conduct of non-Indians on fee lands within its reservation when that conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe.\" Id., at 565-566 (citations omitted).    We concluded in that case that hunting and fishing by nonmembers on reservation land held in fee by nonmembers of the Tribe did not fit within either of the \"Montana exceptions\" that permit jurisdiction over nonmembers. The hunting and fishing in that case did not involve a consensual relationship and did not threaten the security of the Tribe. 450 U.S., at 557. We \"readily agree[d]\" with the Court of Appeals in that case, however, that the Tribe \"may prohibit nonmembers from hunting or fishing on land belonging to the Tribe or held by the United States in trust for the Tribe,\" and that \"if the Tribe permits nonmembers to fish or hunt on such lands, it may condition their entry by charging a fee or establishing . . . limits.\" Ibid. In the cases that followed, we uniformly regarded land ownership as an important factor in determining the scope of a tribe's civil jurisdiction.~    ~    ~      74~      We have held that the tribe's power to impose taxes on nonmembers doing business on tribal or trust lands of the reservation is \"an essential attribute of Indian sovereignty because it is a necessary instrument of self-government and territorial management.\" Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U.S. 130, 137 (1982). We held that the tribe's power to tax derived from two distinct sources: the tribe's power of self-government and the tribe's power to exclude. Id., at 137, 149. Recognizing that tribes are \" 'unique aggregations possessing attributes of sovereignty,' \" however, we further explained that the power to tax was \"subject to constraints not imposed on other governmental entities\" in that the Federal Government could take away that power. Id., at 140-141.~    ~    ~      75~      At issue in Brendale v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 492 U.S. 408 (1989), was whether Tribes had the authority to zone particular tracts of land within the boundaries of the reservation owned by nonmembers. Although no opinion garnered a majority, Members of the Court determined the Tribes' zoning authority by considering the tribes' power to exclude and the Tribes' sovereign interests in preserving the Tribes' political integrity, economic security, and health and welfare. Id., at 423-425, 428-432 (White, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and Scalia and Kennedy, JJ.); id., at 433-435, 443-444 (Stevens, J., joined by O'Connor, J.); id., at 454-455 (Blackmun, J., joined by Brennan and Marshall, JJ.). In the end, the tribes' power to zone each parcel of land turned on the extent to which the tribes maintained ownership and control over the areas in which the parcels were located. Id., at 438-444, 444-447 (Stevens, J., joined by O'Connor, J.).~    ~    ~      76~      In South Dakota v. Bourland, supra, we were again confronted with a tribe's attempt to regulate hunting and fishing by nonmembers on lands located within the boundaries of the tribe's reservation, but not owned by the tribe. In Bourland, the United States had acquired the land at issue from the Tribe under the Flood Control Act and the Cheyenne River Act. Id., at 689-690. We concluded that these congressional enactments deprived the Tribe of \"any former right of absolute and exclusive use and occupation of the conveyed lands.\" Id., at 689. We considered that Montana's exceptions might support tribal jurisdiction over nonmembers, but decided to leave that issue for consideration on remand. 508 U.S., at 695-696.~    ~    ~      77~      We have also applied Montana to decide whether a tribal court had civil jurisdiction to adjudicate a lawsuit arising out of a traffic accident on a state highway that passed through a reservation. Strate v. A-1 Contractors, 520 U.S. 438 (1997). We explained that \"Montana delineated in a main rule and exceptions the bounds of power tribes retain to exercise forms of jurisdiction\" over nonmembers. Because our prior cases did not involve jurisdiction of tribal courts, we clarified that \"[a]s to nonmembers . . . a tribe's adjudicative jurisdiction does not exceed its legislative jurisdiction.\" Id., at 453. Again, we considered the status of the land where the nonmember activities occurred. In accord with Montana, we \"readily agree[d]\" \"that tribes retain considerable control over nonmember conduct on tribal land.\" 520 U.S., at 454. But we determined that the right-of-way acquired for the State's highway rendered that land equivalent to \"alienated, non-Indian land.\" Ibid. Applying Montana, we concluded that the defendant's allegedly tortious conduct did not constitute a consensual relationship that gave rise to tribal court jurisdiction. 520 U.S., at 456-457. We also found that \"[n]either regulatory nor adjudicatory authority over the state highway accident . . . is needed to preserve the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them.\" Id., at 459.~    ~    ~      78~      Just last month, we applied Montana in a case concerning a tribe's authority to tax nonmember activity occurring on non-Indian fee land. Atkinson Trading Co. v. Shirley, 523 U.S. ___ (2001). In that case, the Tribe argued that it had the power to tax under Merrion, supra. We disagreed, distinguishing Merrion on the ground that the Tribe's inherent power to tax \"only extended to 'transactions occurring on trust lands and significantly involving a tribe or its members.' \" 532 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (quoting Merrion, supra, at 137). We explained that \"Merrion involved a tax that only applied to activity occurring on the reservation, and its holding is therefore easily reconcilable with the Montana-Strate line of authority, which we deem to be controlling.\" 532 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 7).~    ~    ~      79~      Montana and our other cases concerning tribal civil jurisdiction over nonmembers occupy a middle ground between our cases that provide for nearly absolute tribal sovereignty over tribe members, see generally Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S. 217, 218-223 (1959), and our rule that tribes have no inherent criminal jurisdiction over nonmembers, see Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe, 435 U.S. 191 (1978). Montana recognizes that tribes retain sovereign interests in activities that occur on land owned and controlled by the tribe, and provides principles that guide our determination of whether particular activities by nonmembers implicate these sovereign interests to a degree that tribal civil jurisdiction is appropriate.~    ~    C~    ~      80~      In this case, the Court purports to apply Montana in keeping with the above line of cases to determine whether a tribe, \"as an exercise of [its] inherent sovereignty . . . can regulate state wardens executing a search warrant for evidence of an off-reservation crime.\" Ante, at 4. The Court's reasoning suffers from two serious flaws: It gives only passing consideration to the fact that the state officials' activities in this case occurred on land owned and controlled by the Tribes, and it treats as dispositive the fact that the nonmembers in this case are state officials.~    ~    ~      81~      Under the first Montana exception, a tribe may exercise regulatory jurisdiction where a nonmember enters into a consensual relationship with the tribe. 450 U.S., at 565. The majority in this case dismisses the applicability of this exception in a footnote, concluding that any consensual relationship between tribes and nonmembers \"clearly\" must be a \"private\" consensual relationship \"from which the official actions at issue in this case are far removed.\" Ante, at 5, n. 3.~    ~    ~      82~      The majority provides no support for this assertion. The Court's decision in Montana did not and could not have resolved the complete scope of the first exception. We could only apply the first exception to the activities presented in that case, namely, hunting and fishing by nonmembers on land owned in fee simple by nonmembers. 450 U.S., at 557. To be sure, Montana is \"an opinion . . . not a statute,\" and therefore it seems inappropriate to speak of what the Montana Court intended the first exception to mean in future cases. See ante, at 18.~    ~    ~      83~      State governments may enter into consensual relationships with tribes, such as contracts for services or shared authority over public resources. Depending upon the nature of the agreement, such relationships could provide official consent to tribal regulatory jurisdiction. Some States have formally sanctioned the creation of tribal-state agreements. See, e.g., Mont. Code Ann. 18-11-101 et seq. (1997) (State-Tribal Cooperative Agreements Act); Neb. Rev. Stat. 13-1502 et seq. (1997) (State-Tribal Cooperative Agreements Act); Okla. Stat., Tit. 74, 1221 (Supp. 2001) (authorizing Governor to enter into cooperative agreements on behalf of the State to address issues of mutual interest). In addition, there are a host of cooperative agreements between tribes and state authorities to share control over tribal lands, to manage public services, and to provide law enforcement. See, e.g., Cal. Health  Safety Code Ann. 25198.1 et seq. (West 1992 and Supp. 2001) (cooperative agreements for hazardous waste management); Cal. Pub. Res. Code Ann. 44201 et seq. (West 1996) (cooperative agreements for solid waste management); Minn. Stat. 626.90 et seq. (Supp. 2001) (authorizing cooperative agreements between state law enforcement and tribal peace officers); Nev. Rev. Stat. 277.058 (Supp. 1999) (cooperative agreements concerning sites of archeological or historical significance); N. M. Stat. Ann. 9-11-12.1 (Supp. 2000) (cooperative agreements for tax administration); Ore. Rev. Stat. 25.075 (1999) (cooperative agreements concerning child support and paternity matters); Wash. Rev. Code 26.25.010 et seq. (1999) (cooperative agreements for child welfare); 79.60.010 (cooperative agreements among federal, state, and tribal governments for timber and forest management).~    ~    ~      84~      Whether a consensual relationship between the Tribes and the State existed in this case is debatable, compare Brief for Petitioners 36-38, with Brief for Respondents Tribal Court in and for the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribes et al. 23-25, but our case law provides no basis to conclude that such a consensual relationship could never exist. Without a full understanding of the applicable relationships among tribal, state, and federal entities, there is no need to create a per se rule that forecloses future debate as to whether cooperative agreements, or other forms of official consent, could ever be a basis for tribal jurisdiction. Compare ante, at 5, n. 3, with ante, at 18-19.~    ~    ~      85~      The second Montana exception states that a tribe may regulate nonmember conduct where that conduct \"threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe.\" 450 U.S., at 566. The majority concentrates on this aspect of Montana, asking whether \"regulatory jurisdiction over state officers in the present context is 'necessary to protect tribal self-government or to control internal relations,' \" and concludes that it is not. Ante, at 6.~    ~    ~      86~      At the outset, the Court recites relatively uncontroversial propositions. A tribe's right to make its own laws and be governed by them \"does not exclude all state regulatory authority on the reservation\"; a reservation \" 'is considered part of the territory of a State' \"; \"States may regulate the activities even of tribe members on tribal land\"; and the \" 'process of [state] courts may run into [a] . . . reservation.' \" Ante, at 7, 8, 9 (citations omitted).~    ~    ~      87~      None of \"these prior statements,\" however, \"accord[s]\" with the majority's conclusion that \"tribal authority to regulate state officers in executing process related to [an off-reservation violation of state law] is not essential to tribal self-government or internal relations.\" Ante, at 10. Our prior decisions are informed by the understanding that tribal, federal, and state governments share authority over tribal lands. See, e.g., Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490 U.S. 163, 176-187 (1989) (concurrent jurisdiction of state and tribal governments to impose severance taxes on oil and gas production by nonmembers); Rice v. Rehner, 463 U.S. 713 (1983) (concurrent jurisdiction of Federal and State Governments to issue liquor licenses for transactions on reservations); Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation, 447 U.S. 134 (1980) (concurrent jurisdiction of state and tribal governments to tax cigarette purchases by nonmembers). Saying that tribal jurisdiction must \"accommodat[e]\" various sovereign interests does not mean that tribal interests are to be nullified through a per se rule. Id., at 156.~    ~    ~      88~      The majority's rule undermining tribal interests is all the more perplexing because the conduct in this case occurred on land owned and controlled by the Tribes. Although the majority gives a passing nod to land status at the outset of its opinion, ante, at 6, that factor is not prominent in the Court's analysis. This oversight is significant. Montana recognizes that tribes may retain inherent power to exercise civil jurisdiction when the nonmember conduct \"threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe.\" 450 U.S., at 566. These interests are far more likely to be implicated where, as here, the nonmember activity takes place on land owned and controlled by the tribe. If Montana is to bring coherence to our case law, we must apply it with due consideration to land status, which has always figured prominently in our analysis of tribal jurisdiction. See supra, at 2-6.~    ~    ~      89~      This case involves state officials acting on tribal land. The Tribes' sovereign interests with respect to nonmember activities on its land are not extinguished simply because the nonmembers in this case are state officials enforcing state law. Our cases concerning tribal power often involve the competing interests of state, federal, and tribal governments. See, e.g., Cotton Petroleum Corp., supra; Confederated Tribes, supra; Rehner, supra. The actions of state officials on tribal land in some instances may affect tribal sovereign interests to a greater, not lesser, degree than the actions of private parties. In this case for example, it is alleged that state officers, who gained access to Hicks' property by virtue of their authority as state actors, exceeded the scope of the search warrants and damaged Hicks' personal property.~    ~    ~      90~      Certainly, state officials should be protected from civil liability for actions undertaken within the scope of their duties. See infra, at 14-15. The majority, however, does not conclude that the officials in this case were acting within the scope of their duties. Moreover, the majority finds it \"irrelevant\" that Hicks' lawsuits are against state officials in their personal capacities. Ante, at 11. The Court instead announces the rule that state officials \"cannot be regulated in the performance of their law-enforcement duties,\" but \"[a]ction unrelated to that is potentially subject to tribal control.\" Ante, at 19. Here, Hicks alleges that state officials exceeded the scope of their authority under the search warrants. The Court holds that the state officials may not be held liable in Tribal Court for these actions, but never explains where these, or more serious allegations involving a breach of authority, would fall within its new rule of state official immunity.~    ~    ~      91~      The Court's reasoning does not reflect a faithful application of Montana and its progeny. Our case law does not support a broad per se rule prohibiting tribal jurisdiction over nonmembers on tribal land whenever the nonmembers are state officials. If the Court were to remain true to the principles that have governed in prior cases, the Court would reverse and remand the case to the Court of Appeals for a proper application of Montana to determine whether there is tribal jurisdiction. Compare 196 F.3d, at 1032-1034 (Rymer, J., dissenting) (concluding that there is no jurisdiction under Montana), with 944 F. Supp. 1455, 1466 (Nev. 1996) (assuming, arguendo, that Montana applies and concluding that there is jurisdiction). See also Bourland, 508 U.S., at 695-696.~    ~    II~    ~      92~      The Court's sweeping analysis gives the impression that this case involves a conflict of great magnitude between the State of Nevada and the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribes. That is not so. At no point did the Tribes attempt to exclude the State from the reservation. At no point did the Tribes attempt to obstruct state officials' efforts to secure or execute the search warrants. Quite the contrary, the record demonstrates that judicial and law enforcement officials from the State and the Tribes acted in full cooperation to investigate an off-reservation crime. Ante, at 1-3; 944 F. Supp., at 1458-1459.~    ~    ~      93~      In this case, Hicks attempts to hold state officials (and tribal officials) liable for allegedly exceeding the scope of the search warrants and damaging his personal property. This case concerns the Tribes' civil adjudicatory jurisdiction over state officials. The Court concludes that it cannot address adjudicatory jurisdiction without first addressing the Tribes' regulatory jurisdiction. Ante, at 3-4. But there is no need for the Court to decide the precise scope of a tribe's regulatory jurisdiction, or to decide in this case whether a tribe's adjudicatory jurisdiction equals its regulatory jurisdiction. Cf. ante, at 4, 20-21.~    ~    ~      94~      To resolve this case, it suffices to answer the questions presented, which concern the civil adjudicatory jurisdiction of tribal courts. See Pet. for Cert. i. Petitioners contend that tribal court jurisdiction over state officials should be determined with reference to officials' claims of immunity. I agree and would resolve this case by applying basic principles of official and qualified immunity.~    ~    ~      95~      The state officials raised immunity defenses to Hicks' claims in Tribal Court. The Tribal Court acknowledged the officials' claims, but did not consider the immunity defenses in determining its jurisdiction. App. to Pet. for Cert. C1-C8. The Federal District Court ruled that because the Tribal Court had not decided the immunity issues, the federal court should stay its hand and not decide the immunity issues while reviewing the Tribal Court's jurisdiction. 944 F. Supp., at 1468-1469, and n. 26. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding that the District Court correctly applied the exhaustion requirement to the immunity issues. 196 F.3d, at 1029-1031. In my view, the Court of Appeals misunderstood our precedents when it refused to consider the state officials' immunity claims as it reviewed the Tribal Court's civil jurisdiction.~    ~    ~      96~      In determining the relationship between tribal courts and state and federal courts, we have developed a doctrine of exhaustion based on principles of comity. See, e.g., Iowa Mut. Ins. Co. v. LaPlante, 480 U.S. 9 (1987); National Farmers Union Ins. Cos. v. Crow Tribe, 471 U.S. 845 (1985). In National Farmers Union, a member of the Tribe sued the local school district, an arm of the State, in a personal injury action. Id., at 847. The defendants sued in federal court challenging the Tribal Court's jurisdiction. The District Court concluded that the Tribal Court lacked jurisdiction and enjoined the Tribal Court proceedings. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to enter the injunction.~    ~    ~      97~      We reversed the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over the federal action. We explained that the \"extent to which Indian tribes have retained the power to regulate the affairs of non-Indians\" is governed by federal law. Id., at 851-852. Likewise, \"[t]he question whether an Indian tribe retains the power to compel a non-Indian property owner to submit to the civil jurisdiction of a tribal court is one that must be answered by reference to federal law,\" and therefore district courts may determine under 28 U.S.C.  1331 whether a tribal court has exceeded the lawful limits of its jurisdiction. 471 U.S., at 852.~    ~    ~      98~      We refused to foreclose entirely the civil jurisdiction of tribal courts over nonmembers as we had foreclosed inherent criminal jurisdiction over nonmembers in Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe, 435 U.S. 191 (1978). See National Farmers, 471 U.S., at 854-855. Instead, we reasoned that \"the existence and extent of a tribal court's jurisdiction will require a careful examination of tribal sovereignty, the extent to which that sovereignty has been altered, divested, or diminished, as well as a detailed study of relevant statutes, Executive Branch policy as embodied in treaties and elsewhere, and administrative or judicial decisions.\" Id., at 855-856. We concluded that this \"examination should be conducted in the first instance in the Tribal Court itself,\" and that a federal court should \"sta[y] its hand\" until after the tribal court has had opportunity to determine its own jurisdiction. Id., at 856-857.~    ~    ~      99~      In Iowa Mutual, an insurance company sued members of a Tribe in federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction; at the same time, a civil lawsuit by the tribal members was pending against the nonmember insurance company in Tribal Court. 480 U.S., at 11-13. The District Court granted the tribe members' motion to dismiss the federal action for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that the Tribal Court should have had the first opportunity to determine its jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals affirmed.~    ~    ~      100~      We reversed and remanded. We made clear that the Tribal Court should be given the first opportunity to determine its jurisdiction, but emphasized that \"[e]xhaustion is required as a matter of comity, not as a jurisdictional prerequisite.\" Id., at 16-17, and n. 8. We explained that tribal court remedies must be exhausted, but the tribal court's \"determination of tribal jurisdiction is ultimately subject to review,\" and may be challenged in district court. Id., at 19.~    ~    ~      101~      Later, in Strate, \"we reiterate[d] that National Farmers and Iowa Mutual enunciate only an exhaustion requirement, a prudential rule, based on comity.\" 520 U.S., at 453 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). See also El Paso Natural Gas Co. v. Neztsosie, 526 U.S. 473, 482-487 (1999). Application of that principle in this case leads me to conclude that the District Court and the Court of Appeals should have considered the state officials' immunity claims as they determined the Tribal Court's jurisdiction.~    ~    ~      102~      The doctrines of official immunity, see, e.g., Westfall v. Erwin, 484 U.S. 292, 296-300 (1988), and qualified immunity, see, e.g., Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 813-819 (1982), are designed to protect state and federal officials from civil liability for conduct that was within the scope of their duties or conduct that did not violate clearly established law. These doctrines short circuit civil litigation for officials who meet these standards so that these officials are not subjected to the costs of trial or the burdens of discovery. 457 U.S., at 817-818. For example, the Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988, commonly known as the Westfall Act, allows the United States to substitute itself for a federal employee as defendant upon certifying that the employee was acting within the scope of his duties. 28 U.S.C.  2679(d). Nevada law contains analogous provisions. See Nev. Rev. Stat. 41.032, 41.0335-41.0339 (1996 and Supp. 1999). The employee who successfully claims official immunity therefore invokes the immunity of the sovereign. When a state or federal official asserts qualified immunity, he claims that his actions were reasonable in light of clearly established law. Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635 (1987). In those cases, we allow that official to take an immediate interlocutory appeal from an adverse ruling to ensure that the civil proceedings do not continue if immunity should be granted. Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 524-530 (1985).~    ~    ~      103~      In this case, the state officials raised their immunity defenses in Tribal Court as they challenged that court's subject matter jurisdiction. App. to Pet. for Cert. J5-J6, K8, K11-K13; 196 F.3d, at 1029-1031. Thus the Tribal Court and the Appellate Tribal Court had a full opportunity to address the immunity claims. These defendants, like other officials facing civil liability, were entitled to have their immunity defenses adjudicated at the earliest stage possible to avoid needless litigation. It requires no \"magic\" to afford officials the same protection in tribal court that they would be afforded in state or federal court. Ante, at 20. I would therefore reverse the Court of Appeals in this case on the ground that it erred in failing to address the state officials' immunity defenses. It is possible that Hicks' lawsuits would have been easily disposed of on the basis of official and qualified immunity.~    ~    ~      104~      * * *~    ~    ~      105~      The Court issues a broad holding that significantly alters the principles that govern determinations of tribal adjudicatory and regulatory jurisdiction. While I agree that Montana guides our analysis, I do not believe that the Court has properly applied Montana. I would not adopt a per se rule of tribal jurisdiction that fails to consider adequately the Tribes' inherent sovereign interests in activities on their land, nor would I give nonmembers freedom to act with impunity on tribal land based solely on their status as state law enforcement officials. I would hold that Montana governs a tribe's civil jurisdiction over nonmembers, and that in order to protect government officials, immunity claims should be considered in reviewing tribal court jurisdiction. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      106~      Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Breyer joins, concurring in the judgment.~    ~    ~      107~      While I join the Court's disposition of the case for the reasons stated by Justice O'Connor, I do not agree with the Court's conclusion that tribal courts may not exercise their jurisdiction over claims seeking the relief authorized by 42 U.S.C.  1983.1 I agree instead with the Solicitor General's submission that a tribal court may entertain such a claim unless enjoined from doing so by a federal court. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae24-30.~    ~    ~      108~      The majority's analysis of this question is exactly backwards. It appears to start from the assumption that tribal courts do not have jurisdiction to hear federal claims unless federal law expressly grants them the power, see ante, at 13, and then concludes that, because no such express grant of power has occurred with respect to 1983, tribal courts must lack the authority to adjudicate those claims. Ibid. (\"[N]o provision in federal law provides for tribal-court jurisdiction over 1983 actions\"). But the Court's initial assumption is deeply flawed. Absent federal law to the contrary, the question whether tribal courts are courts of general jurisdiction is fundamentally one of tribal law. Cf. Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 453 U.S. 473, 478 (1981) (State-court subject-matter jurisdiction is \"governed in the first instance by state law\" (emphasis added)).2 Given a tribal assertion of general subject-matter jurisdiction, we should recognize a tribe's authority to adjudicate claims arising under 1983 unless federal law dictates otherwise. Cf. id., at 477-478 (\"[S]tate courts may assume subject-matter jurisdiction over a federal cause of action absent provision by Congress to the contrary or disabling incompatibility between the federal claim and state-court adjudication\").3~    ~    ~      109~      I see no compelling reason of federal law to deny tribal courts the authority, if they have jurisdiction over the parties, to decide claims arising under 1983. Section 1983 creates no new substantive rights, see Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization, 441 U.S. 600, 617 (1979); it merely provides a federal cause of action for the violation of federal rights that are independently established either in the Federal Constitution or in federal statutory law. Despite the absence of any mention of state courts in 1983, we have never questioned the jurisdiction of such courts to provide the relief it authorizes.4~    ~    ~      110~      Moreover, as our decision in El Paso Natural Gas Co. v. Neztsosie, 526 U.S. 473 (1999), demonstrates, the absence of an express statutory provision for removal to a federal court upon the motion of the defendant provides no obstacle whatsoever to the granting of equivalent relief by a federal district court. See id., at 485 (\"Injunction against further litigation in tribal courts would in practical terms give the same result as a removal  \"). \"Why, then, the congressional silence on tribal courts?   [I]nadvertence seems the most likely [explanation]   . Now and then silence is not pregnant.\" Id., at 487. There is really no more reason for treating the silence in 1983 concerning tribal courts as an objection to tribal-court jurisdiction over such claims than there is for treating its silence concerning state courts as an objection to state-court jurisdiction.~    ~    ~      111~      In sum, I agree with the interpretation of this federal statute that is endorsed by the Solicitor General of the United States.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~          As an initial matter, it is not at all clear to me that the Court's discussion of the 1983 issue is necessary to the disposition of this case. Strate v. A-1 Contractors, 520 U.S. 438 (1997), discusses the question whether a tribal court can exercise jurisdiction over nonmembers, irrespective of the type of claim being raised. See id., at 459, n. 14 (\"When   it is plain that no federal grant provides for tribal governance of nonmembers' conduct on land covered by [the main rule in] Montana [v. United States, 450 U.S. 544 (1981)],   it will be equally evident that tribal courts lack adjudicatory authority over disputes arising from such conduct\"). Cf. El Paso Natural Gas Co. v. Neztsosie, 526 U.S. 473, 482, n. 4 (1999) (\"Strate dealt with claims against nonmembers arising on state highways, and 'express[ed] no view on the governing law or proper forum when an accident occurs on a tribal road within a reservation' \"). Given the majority's determination in Part II that tribal courts lack such jurisdiction over \"state wardens executing a search warrant for evidence of an off-reservation crime,\" ante, at 3, I fail to see why the Court needs to reach out to discuss the seemingly hypothetical question whether, if the tribal courts had jurisdiction over claims against \"state wardens executing a search warrant,\" they could hear 1983 claims against those wardens.~      ~      ~        2~          This principle is not based upon any mystical attribute of sovereignty, as the majority suggests, see ante, at 12, but rather upon the simple, common-sense notion that it is the body creating a court that determines what sorts of claims that court will hear. The questions whether that court has the power to compel anyone to listen to it and whether its assertion of subject-matter jurisdiction conflicts with some higher law are separate issues.~      ~      ~        3~          The majority claims that \"Strate is [the] 'federal law to the contrary' \" that explains its restriction of tribal court subject-matter jurisdiction over 1983 suits. Ante, at 13, n. 7. But Strate merely concerned the circumstances under which tribal courts can exert jurisdiction over claims against nonmembers. See 520 U.S., at 447-448. It most certainly does not address the question whether, assuming such jurisdiction to exist, tribal courts can entertain 1983 suits. Yet the majority's holding that tribal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over 1983 suits would, presumably, bar those courts from hearing such claims even if jurisdiction over nonmembers would be proper under Strate. Accordingly, whatever else Strate may do, it does not supply the proposition of federal law upon which the majority purports to rely. Of course, if the majority, as it suggests, is merely holding that 1983 does not enlarge tribal jurisdiction beyond what is permitted by Strate, its decision today is far more limited than it might first appear from the Court's sometimes sweeping language. Compare ante, at 15 (\"[T]ribal courts cannot entertain 1983 suits\"), with ante, at 12, n. 7 (\"We conclude (as we must) that 1983 is not   an enlargement [of tribal-court jurisdiction]\"). After all, if the Court's holding is that 1983 merely fails to \"enlarg[e]\" tribal-court jurisdiction, then nothing would prevent tribal courts from deciding 1983 claims in cases in which they properly exercise jurisdiction under Strate.~      ~      ~        4~          The authority of state courts to hear 1983 suits was not always so uncontroversial. See, e.g., Note, Limiting the Section 1983 Action in the Wake of Monroe v. Pape, 82 Harv. L. Rev. 1486, 1497, n. 62 (1969) (\"State courts have puzzlingly hesitated on whether they have jurisdiction over 1983 claims as such, and no case has been found in which a state court granted relief under the section. In one case a state supreme court adopted the expedient of disavowing a position on jurisdiction while denying recovery on the merits\").~      ~    ~    ",

Readers are requested to notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D. C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.UNITED STATES and DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, PETITIONERSv.UNITED FOODS, INC.~    No. 00-276~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued April 17, 2001June 25, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      The Mushroom Promotion, Research, and Consumer Information Act mandates that fresh mushroom handlers pay assessments used primarily to fund advertisements promoting mushroom sales. Respondent refused to pay the assessment, claiming that it violates the First Amendment. It filed a petition challenging the assessment with the Secretary of Agriculture, and the United States filed an enforcement action in the District Court. After the administrative appeal was denied, respondent sought review in the District Court, which consolidated the two cases. In granting the Government summary judgment, the court found dispositive the decision in Glickman v. Wileman Brothers  Elliott, Inc., 521 U.S. 457, that the First Amendment was not violated when agricultural marketing orders, as part of a larger regulatory marketing scheme, required producers of California tree fruit to pay assessments for product advertising. The Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that Glickman did not control because the mandated payments in this case were not part of a comprehensive statutory agricultural marketing program.~      Held: The assessment requirement violates the First Amendment. Pp. 2-11.~      (a) Even viewing the expression here as commercial speech, there is no basis under Glickman or this Court's other precedents to sustain the assessments. The First Amendment may prevent the government from, inter alia, compelling individuals to pay subsidies for speech to which they object. See Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U.S. 209; Keller v. State Bar of Cal., 496 U.S. 1. Such precedents provide the beginning point for analysis here. Respondent wants to convey the message that its brand of mushrooms is superior to those grown by other producers, and it objects to being charged for a contrary message which seems to be favored by a majority of producers. First Amendment values are at serious risk if the government can compel a citizen or group of citizens to subsidize speech on the side that it favors; and there is no apparent principle distinguishing out of hand minor debates about whether a branded mushroom is better than just any mushroom. Thus, the compelled funding here must pass First Amendment scrutiny. Pp. 3-5.~      (b) The program sustained in Glickman differs from the one at issue here in a fundamental respect: The mandated assessments for speech in that case were ancillary to a more comprehensive program restricting marketing autonomy. This Court stressed in Glickman that the entire regulatory program must be considered in resolving a case. There, California tree fruits were marketed under detailed marketing orders that had displaced competition to such an extent that they had an antitrust exemption; the Court presumed that the producers compelled to contribute funds for cooperative advertising were bound together and required by statute to market their products according to cooperative rules. Those important features are not present here. Most of the funds at issue are used for generic advertising; and there are no marketing orders regulating mushroom production and sales, no antitrust exemption, and nothing preventing individual producers from making their own marketing decisions. Mushroom growers are not forced to associate as a group that makes cooperative decisions. Although respondent is required simply to support speech by others, not to utter speech itself, that mandated support is contrary to the First Amendment principles set forth in cases involving expression by groups which include persons who object to the speech but, nevertheless, must remain group members by law or necessity. See, e.g., Abood, supra, Keller, supra. Properly applied, Abood's rule protecting against compelled assessments for some speech requires this scheme to be invalidated. Before addressing whether a conflict with freedom of belief exists, the threshold inquiry must be whether there is some state imposed obligation making group membership less than voluntary; for it is only the overriding associational purpose which allows any compelled subsidy for speech in the first place. In Abood, Keller, and Glickman, the objecting members were required to associate for purposes other than the compelled subsidies for speech. Here, however, the only program the Government contends the assessments serve is the very advertising scheme in question. Were it sufficient to say speech is germane to itself, Abood's and Keller's limits would be empty of meaning and significance. No corollary to Glickman's cooperative marketing structure exists here; the expression respondent is required to support is not germane to an association's purpose independent from the speech itself; and Abood's rationale extends to the party who objects to the compelled support for this speech. There is also no suggestion here that the assessments are necessary to make voluntary advertisements nonmisleading for consumers. Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U.S. 626, distinguished. Because the Government did not raise in the Sixth Circuit its theory that this case is permissible government speech, this Court will not entertain that argument here. Pp. 5-11.197 F.3d 221, affirmed.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT~      Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and Stevens, Scalia, Souter, and Thomas, JJ., joined.~      Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      Four Terms ago, in Glickman v. Wileman Brothers  Elliott, Inc., 521 U.S. 457 (1997), the Court rejected a First Amendment challenge to the constitutionality of a series of agricultural marketing orders that, as part of a larger regulatory marketing scheme, required producers of certain California tree fruit to pay assessments for product advertising. In this case a federal statute mandates assessments on handlers of fresh mushrooms to fund advertising for the product. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit determined the mandated payments were not part of a more comprehensive statutory program for agricultural marketing, thus dictating a different result than in Glickman. It held the assessment requirement unconstitutional, and we granted certiorari. 530 U.S. 1009 (2000).~    ~    ~      2~      The statute in question, enacted by Congress in 1990, is the Mushroom Promotion, Research, and Consumer Information Act, 104 Stat. 3854, 7 U.S.C.  6101 et seq. The Act authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a Mushroom Council to pursue the statute's goals. Mushroom producers and importers, as defined by the statute, submit nominations from among their group to the Secretary, who then designates the Council membership. 7 U.S.C.  6104(b)(1)(B), 6102(6), 6102(11). To fund its programs, the Act allows the Council to impose mandatory assessments upon handlers of fresh mushrooms in an amount not to exceed one cent per pound of mushrooms produced or imported. 6104(g)(2). The assessments can be used for \"projects of mushroom promotion, research, consumer information, and industry information.\" 6104(c)(4). It is undisputed, though, that most monies raised by the assessments are spent for generic advertising to promote mushroom sales.~    ~    ~      3~      Respondent United Foods, Inc., is a large agricultural enterprise based in Tennessee. It grows and distributes many crops and products, including fresh mushrooms. In 1996 respondent refused to pay its mandatory assessments under the Act. The forced subsidy for generic advertising, it contended, is a violation of the First Amendment. Respondent challenged the assessments in a petition filed with the Secretary. The United States filed an action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, seeking an order compelling respondent to pay. Both matters were stayed pending this Court's decision in Glickman.~    ~    ~      4~      After Glickman was decided, the Administrative Law Judge dismissed respondent's petition, and the Judicial Officer of the Department of Agriculture affirmed. Respondent sought review in District Court, and its suit was consolidated with the Government's enforcement action. The District Court, holding Glickman dispositive of the First Amendment challenge, granted the Government's motion for summary judgment. App. to Pet. for Cert. 18a.~    ~    ~      5~      The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held this case is not controlled by Glickman and reversed the District Court. 197 F.3d 221 (1999). We agree with the Court of Appeals and now affirm.~    ~    ~      6~      A quarter of a century ago, the Court held that commercial speech, usually defined as speech that does no more than propose a commercial transaction, is protected by the First Amendment. Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 748, 762 (1976). \"The commercial marketplace, like other spheres of our social and cultural life, provides a forum where ideas and information flourish.\" Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U.S. 761, 767 (1993).~    ~    ~      7~      We have used standards for determining the validity of speech regulations which accord less protection to commercial speech than to other expression. See, e.g., Ibid.; Central Hudson Gas  Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U.S. 557 (1980). That approach, in turn, has been subject to some criticism. See, e.g., Glickman, supra, at 504 (Thomas, J., dissenting); 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U.S. 484, 518 (1996) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U.S. 476, 493 (1995) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). We need not enter into the controversy, for even viewing commercial speech as entitled to lesser protection, we find no basis under either Glickman or our other precedents to sustain the compelled assessments sought in this case. It should be noted, moreover, that the Government itself does not rely upon Central Hudson to challenge the Court of Appeals' decision, Reply Brief for Petitioners 9, n. 7, and we therefore do not consider whether the Government's interest could be considered substantial for purposes of the Central Hudson test. The question is whether the government may underwrite and sponsor speech with a certain viewpoint using special subsidies exacted from a designated class of persons, some of whom object to the idea being advanced.~    ~    ~      8~      Just as the First Amendment may prevent the government from prohibiting speech, the Amendment may prevent the government from compelling individuals to express certain views, see Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 714 (1977); West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943), or from compelling certain individuals to pay subsidies for speech to which they object. See Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U.S. 209 (1977); Keller v. State Bar of Cal., 496 U.S. 1 (1990); see also Glickman, 521 U. S, at 469, n. 13. Our precedents concerning compelled contributions to speech provide the beginning point for our analysis. The fact that the speech is in aid of a commercial purpose does not deprive respondent of all First Amendment protection, as held in the cases already cited. The subject matter of the speech may be of interest to but a small segment of the population; yet those whose business and livelihood depend in some way upon the product involved no doubt deem First Amendment protection to be just as important for them as it is for other discrete, little noticed groups in a society which values the freedom resulting from speech in all its diverse parts. First Amendment concerns apply here because of the requirement that producers subsidize speech with which they disagree.~    ~    ~      9~      \"[T]he general rule is that the speaker and the audience, not the government, assess the value of the information presented.\" Edenfield, supra, at 767. There are some instances in which compelled subsidies for speech contradict that constitutional principle. Here the disagreement could be seen as minor: Respondent wants to convey the message that its brand of mushrooms is superior to those grown by other producers. It objects to being charged for a message which seems to be favored by a majority of producers. The message is that mushrooms are worth consuming whether or not they are branded. First Amendment values are at serious risk if the government can compel a particular citizen, or a discrete group of citizens, to pay special subsidies for speech on the side that it favors; and there is no apparent principle which distinguishes out of hand minor debates about whether a branded mushroom is better than just any mushroom. As a consequence, the compelled funding for the advertising must pass First Amendment scrutiny.~    ~    ~      10~      In the Government's view the assessment in this case is permitted by Glickman because it is similar in important respects. It imposes no restraint on the freedom of an objecting party to communicate its own message; the program does not compel an objecting party (here a corporate entity) itself to express views it disfavors; and the mandated scheme does not compel the expression of political or ideological views. See Glickman, 521 U.S., at 469-470. These points were noted in Glickman in the context of a different type of regulatory scheme and are not controlling of the outcome. The program sustained in Glickman differs from the one under review in a most fundamental respect. In Glickman the mandated assessments for speech were ancillary to a more comprehensive program restricting marketing autonomy. Here, for all practical purposes, the advertising itself, far from being ancillary, is the principal object of the regulatory scheme.~    ~    ~      11~      In Glickman we stressed from the very outset that the entire regulatory program must be considered in resolving the case. In deciding that case we emphasized \"the importance of the statutory context in which it arises.\" 521 U.S., at 469. The California tree fruits were marketed \"pursuant to detailed marketing orders that ha[d] displaced many aspects of independent business activity.\" Id., at 469. Indeed, the marketing orders \"displaced competition\" to such an extent that they were \"expressly exempted from the antitrust laws.\" Id., at 461. The market for the tree fruit regulated by the program was characterized by \"[c]ollective action, rather than the aggregate consequences of independent competitive choices.\" Ibid. The producers of tree fruit who were compelled to contribute funds for use in cooperative advertising \"d[id] so as a part of a broader collective enterprise in which their freedom to act independently [wa]s already constrained by the regulatory scheme.\" Id., at 469. The opinion and the analysis of the Court proceeded upon the premise that the producers were bound together and required by the statute to market their products according to cooperative rules. To that extent, their mandated participation in an advertising program with a particular message was the logical concomitant of a valid scheme of economic regulation.~    ~    ~      12~      The features of the marketing scheme found important in Glickman are not present in the case now before us. As respondent notes, and as the Government does not contest, cf. Brief for Petitioners 25, almost all of the funds collected under the mandatory assessments are for one purpose: generic advertising. Beyond the collection and disbursement of advertising funds, there are no marketing orders that regulate how mushrooms may be produced and sold, no exemption from the antitrust laws, and nothing preventing individual producers from making their own marketing decisions. As the Court of Appeals recognized, there is no \"heavy regulation through marketing orders\" in the mushroom market. 197 F.3d, at 225. Mushroom producers are not forced to associate as a group which makes cooperative decisions. \"[T]he mushroom growing business   is unregulated, except for the enforcement of a regional mushroom advertising program,\" and \"the mushroom market has not been collectivized, exempted from antitrust laws, subjected to a uniform price, or otherwise subsidized through price supports or restrictions on supply.\" Id., at 222, 223.~    ~    ~      13~      It is true that the party who protests the assessment here is required simply to support speech by others, not to utter the speech itself. We conclude, however, that the mandated support is contrary to the First Amendment principles set forth in cases involving expression by groups which include persons who object to the speech, but who, nevertheless, must remain members of the group by law or necessity. See, e.g., Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U.S. 209 (1977); Keller v. State Bar of Cal., 496 U.S. 1 (1990).~    ~    ~      14~      The Government claims that, despite the lack of cooperative marketing, the Abood rule protecting against compelled assessments for some speech is inapplicable. We did say in Glickman that Abood \"recognized a First Amendment interest in not being compelled to contribute to an organization whose expressive activities conflict with one's 'freedom of belief.' \" 521 U.S., at 471 (quoting Abood, 431 U.S., at 235). We take further instruction, however, from Abood's statement that speech need not be characterized as political before it receives First Amendment protection. Id., at 232. A proper application of the rule in Abood requires us to invalidate the instant statutory scheme. Before addressing whether a conflict with freedom of belief exists, a threshold inquiry must be whether there is some state imposed obligation which makes group membership less than voluntary; for it is only the overriding associational purpose which allows any compelled subsidy for speech in the first place. In Abood, the infringement upon First Amendment associational rights worked by a union shop arrangement was \"constitutionally justified by the legislative assessment of the important contribution of the union shop to the system of labor relations established by Congress.\" Id., at 222. To attain the desired benefit of collective bargaining, union members and nonmembers were required to associate with one another, and the legitimate purposes of the group were furthered by the mandated association.~    ~    ~      15~      A similar situation obtained in Keller v. State Bar of Cal., supra. A state-mandated, integrated bar sought to ensure that \"all of the lawyers who derive benefit from the unique status of being among those admitted to practice before the courts [were] called upon to pay a fair share of the cost.\" Id., at 12. Lawyers could be required to pay monies in support of activities that were germane to the reason justifying the compelled association in the first place, for example expenditures (including expenditures for speech) that related to \"activities connected with disciplining members of the Bar or proposing ethical codes for the profession.\" Id., at 16. Those who were required to pay a subsidy for the speech of the association already were required to associate for other purposes, making the compelled contribution of monies to pay for expressive activities a necessary incident of a larger expenditure for an otherwise proper goal requiring the cooperative activity. The central holding in Keller, moreover, was that the objecting members were not required to give speech subsidies for matters not germane to the larger regulatory purpose which justified the required association.~    ~    ~      16~      The situation was much the same in Glickman. As noted above, the market for tree fruit was cooperative. To proceed, the statutory scheme used marketing orders that to a large extent deprived producers of their ability to compete and replaced competition with a regime of cooperation. The mandated cooperation was judged by Congress to be necessary to maintain a stable market. Given that producers were bound together in the common venture, the imposition upon their First Amendment rights caused by using compelled contributions for germane advertising was, as in Abood and Keller, in furtherance of an otherwise legitimate program. Though four Justices who join this opinion disagreed, the majority of the Court in Glickman found the compelled contributions were nothing more than additional economic regulation, which did not raise First Amendment concerns. Glickman, 521 U.S., at 474; see id., at 477 (Souter, J., dissenting).~    ~    ~      17~      The statutory mechanism as it relates to handlers of mushrooms is concededly different from the scheme in Glickman; here the statute does not require group action, save to generate the very speech to which some handlers object. In contrast to the program upheld in Glickman, where the Government argued the compelled contributions for advertising were \"part of a far broader regulatory system that does not principally concern speech,\" Reply Brief for Petitioner, O. T. 1996, No. 95-1184, p. 4, there is no broader regulatory system in place here. We have not upheld compelled subsidies for speech in the context of a program where the principal object is speech itself. Although greater regulation of the mushroom market might have been implemented under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, 50 Stat. 246, 7 U.S.C.  601 et seq., the compelled contributions for advertising are not part of some broader regulatory scheme. The only program the Government contends the compelled contributions serve is the very advertising scheme in question. Were it sufficient to say speech is germane to itself, the limits observed in Abood and Keller would be empty of meaning and significance. The cooperative marketing structure relied upon by a majority of the Court in Glickman to sustain an ancillary assessment finds no corollary here; the expression respondent is required to support is not germane to a purpose related to an association independent from the speech itself; and the rationale of Abood extends to the party who objects to the compelled support for this speech. For these and other reasons we have set forth, the assessments are not permitted under the First Amendment.~    ~    ~      18~      Our conclusions are not inconsistent with the Court's decision in Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U.S. 626 (1985), a case involving attempts by a State to prohibit certain voluntary advertising by licensed attorneys. The Court invalidated the restrictions in substantial part but did permit a rule requiring that attorneys who advertised by their own choice and who referred to contingent fees should disclose that clients might be liable for costs. Noting that substantial numbers of potential clients might be misled by omission of the explanation, the Court sustained the requirement as consistent with the State's interest in \"preventing deception of consumers.\" Id., at 651. There is no suggestion in the case now before us that the mandatory assessments imposed to require one group of private persons to pay for speech by others are somehow necessary to make voluntary advertisements nonmisleading for consumers.~    ~    ~      19~      The Government argues the advertising here is government speech, and so immune from the scrutiny we would otherwise apply. As the Government admits in a forthright manner, however, this argument was \"not raised or addressed\" in the Court of Appeals. Brief for Petitioners 32, n. 19. The Government, citing Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U.S. 374 (1995), suggests that the question is embraced within the question set forth in the petition for certiorari. In Lebron, the theory presented by the petitioner in the brief on the merits was addressed by the court whose judgment was being reviewed. Id., at 379. Here, by contrast, it is undisputed that the Court of Appeals did not mention the government speech theory now put forward for our consideration.~    ~    ~      20~      The Government's failure to raise its argument in the Court of Appeals deprived respondent of the ability to address significant matters that might have been difficult points for the Government. For example, although the Government asserts that advertising is subject to approval by the Secretary of Agriculture, respondent claims the approval is pro forma. This and other difficult issues would have to be addressed were the program to be labeled, and sustained, as government speech.~    ~    ~      21~      We need not address the question, however. Although in some instances we have allowed a respondent to defend a judgment on grounds other than those pressed or passed upon below, see, e.g., United States v. Estate of Romani, 523 U.S. 517, 526, n. 11 (1998), it is quite a different matter to allow a petitioner to assert new substantive arguments attacking, rather than defending, the judgment when those arguments were not pressed in the court whose opinion we are reviewing, or at least passed upon by it. Just this Term we declined an invitation by an amicus to entertain new arguments to overturn a judgment, see Lopez v. Davis, 531 U.S. 230, 244, n. 6 (2001), and we consider it the better course to decline a party's suggestion for doing so in this case.~    ~    ~      22~      For the reasons we have discussed, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is~    ~    ~      23~      Affirmed.~    ~    ~      24~      Stevens, J., and Thomas, J., filed concurring opinions.~    ~    ~      25~      Breyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Ginsburg, J., joined, and in which O'Connor, J., joined as to Parts I and III.~    ~    ~      26~      Justice Stevens, concurring.~    ~    ~      27~      Justice Breyer has correctly noted that the program at issue in this case, like that in Glickman v. Wileman Brothers  Elliott, Inc., 521 U.S. 457 (1997), \"does not compel speech itself; it compels the payment of money.\" Post, at 7-8 (dissenting opinion). This fact suffices to distinguish these compelled subsidies from the compelled speech in cases like West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943), and Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705 (1977). It does not follow, however, that the First Amendment is not implicated when a person is forced to subsidize speech to which he objects. Keller v. State Bar of Cal., 496 U.S. 1, 13-14 (1990). As we held in Glickman, Keller, and a number of other cases, such a compelled subsidy is permissible when it is ancillary, or \"germane,\" to a valid cooperative endeavor. The incremental impact on the liberty of a person who has already surrendered far greater liberty to the collective entity (either voluntarily or as a result of permissible compulsion) does not, in my judgment, raise a significant constitutional issue if it is ancillary to the main purpose of the collective program.~    ~    ~      28~      This case, however, raises the open question whether such compulsion is constitutional when nothing more than commercial advertising is at stake. The naked imposition of such compulsion, like a naked restraint on speech itself, seems quite different to me.* We need not decide whether other interests, such as the health or artistic concerns mentioned by Justice Breyer, post, at 10, might justify a compelled subsidy like this, but surely the interest in making one entrepreneur finance advertising for the benefit of his competitors, including some who are not required to contribute, is insufficient.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        *~          The Court has held that the First Amendment is implicated by government regulation of contributions and expenditures for political purposes. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976) (per curiam). Although it by no means follows that the reasoning in such cases would apply to the regulation of expenditures for advertising, I think it clear that government compulsion to finance objectionable speech imposes a greater restraint on liberty than government regulation of money used to subsidize the speech of others. Even in the commercial speech context, I think it entirely proper for the Court to rely on the First Amendment when evaluating the significance of such compulsion.~      ~    ~    ~      29~      Justice Thomas, concurring.~    ~    ~      30~      I agree with the Court that Glickman v. Wileman Brothers  Elliott, Inc., 521 U.S. 457 (1997), is not controlling. I write separately, however, to reiterate my views that \"paying money for the purposes of advertising involves speech,\" and that \"compelling speech raises a First Amendment issue just as much as restricting speech.\" Id., at 504 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Any regulation that compels the funding of advertising must be subjected to the most stringent First Amendment scrutiny.~    ~    ~      31~      Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, and with whom Justice O'Connor joins as to Parts I and III, dissenting.~    ~    ~      32~      The Court, in my view, disregards controlling precedent, fails properly to analyze the strength of the relevant regulatory and commercial speech interests, and introduces into First Amendment law an unreasoned legal principle that may well pose an obstacle to the development of beneficial forms of economic regulation. I consequently dissent.~    ~    ~      33~      * Only four years ago this Court considered a case very similar to this one, Glickman v. Wileman Brothers  Elliott, Inc., 521 U.S. 457 (1997). The issue there, like here, was whether the First Amendment prohibited the Government from collecting a fee for collective product advertising from an objecting grower of those products (nectarines, peaches, and plums). We held that the collection of the fee did not \"rais[e] a First Amendment issue for us to resolve,\" but rather was \"simply a question of economic policy for Congress and the Executive to resolve.\" Id., at 468. We gave the following reasons in support of our conclusion:~    ~    ~      34~      \"First, the marketing orders impose no restraint on the freedom of any producer to communicate any message to any audience. Second, they do not compel any person to engage in any actual or symbolic speech. Third, they do not compel the producers to endorse or to finance any political or ideological views.\" Id., at 469-470.This case, although it involves mushrooms rather than fruit, is identical in each of these three critical respects. No one, including the Court, claims otherwise. And I believe these similar characteristics demand a similar conclusion.~    ~    ~      35~      The Court sees an important difference in what it says is the fact that Wileman's fruit producers were subject to regulation (presumably price and supply regulation) that \" 'displaced competition,' \" to the \"extent that they were 'expressly exempted from the antitrust laws.' \" Ante, at 5 (quoting 521 U.S., at 461). The mushroom producers here, it says, are not \" 'subjected to a uniform price,   restrictio[n] on supply,' \" ante, at 6 (quoting 197 F.3d 221, 222, 223 (CA6 1999)), or any other \"common venture\" that \"depriv[es]\" them of the \"ability to compete,\" ante, at 8. And it characterizes this difference as \"fundamental.\" Ante, at 5.~    ~    ~      36~      But the record indicates that the difference to which the Court points could not have been critical. The Court in Wileman did not refer to the presence of price or output regulations. It referred to the fact that Congress had \"authorized\" that kind of regulation. 521 U.S., at 462 (emphasis added). See also id., at 461 (citing agricultural marketing statute while noting that marketing orders issued under its authority \"may include\" price and quantity controls (emphasis added)). Both then-existing federal regulations and Justice Souter's dissenting opinion make clear that, at least in respect to some of Wileman's marketing orders, price and output regulations, while \"authorized,\" were not, in fact, in place. See 7 CFR pts. 916, 917 (1997) (setting forth container, packaging, grade, and size regulations, but not price and output regulations); 521 U.S., at 500, n. 13 (souter, J., dissenting) (noting that \"the extent to which the Act eliminates competition varies among different marketing orders\"). In this case, just as in Wileman, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to promulgate price and supply regulations. See ante, at 9 (\"greater regulation of the mushroom market might have been implemented under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937\"); 7 U.S.C.  608c(2), (6)(A), (7). But in neither case has she actually done so. Perhaps that is why the Court in Wileman did not rely heavily upon the existence of the Secretary's authority to regulate prices or output. See 521 U.S., at 469 (noting statutory scheme in passing).~    ~    ~      37~      Regardless, it is difficult to understand why the presence or absence of price and output regulations could make a critical First Amendment difference. The Court says that collective fruit advertising (unlike mushroom advertising) was the \"logical concomitant\" of the more comprehensive \"economic\" regulatory \"scheme.\" Ante, at 6. But it does not explain how that could be so. Producer price-fixing schemes seek to keep prices higher than market conditions might otherwise dictate, as do restrictions on supply. Antitrust exemptions are a \"logical concomitant,\" for otherwise the price or output agreement might be held unlawful. But collective advertising has no obvious comparable connection. As far as Wileman or the record here suggests, collective advertising might, or might not, help bring about prices higher than market conditions would otherwise dictate. Certainly nothing in Wileman suggests the contrary. Cf. 521 U.S., at 477 (Souter, J., dissenting) (criticizing the Court for not requiring advertising program to be \"reasonably necessary to implement the regulation\").~    ~    ~      38~      By contrast, the advertising here relates directly, not in an incidental or subsidiary manner, to the regulatory program's underlying goal of \"maintain[ing] and expand[ing] existing markets and uses for mushrooms.\" 7 U.S.C.  6101(b)(2). As the Mushroom Act's economic goals indicate, collective promotion and research is a perfectly traditional form of government intervention in the marketplace. Promotion may help to overcome inaccurate consumer perceptions about a product. See Hearings on H. R. 1776 et al. before the Subcommittee on Domestic Marketing, Consumer Relations, and Nutrition of the House Committee on Agriculture, 101st Cong., 1st Sess., 99 (1989) (hereinafter Hearings) (statement of Rep. Grant) (noting need to overcome consumer fears about safety of eating mushrooms and that per capita mushroom consumption in Canada was twice that of United States). Overcoming those perceptions will sometimes bring special public benefits. See 7 U.S.C.  6101(a)(1)-(3) (mushrooms are \"valuable part of the human diet,\" and their production \"benefits the environment\"). And compelled payment may be needed to produce those benefits where, otherwise, some producers would take a free ride on the expenditures of others. See Hearings 95-96 (statement of James Ciarrocchi) (\"The   industry has embarked on several voluntary promotion campaigns over the years  . [A] lesson from every one   has been unreliability, inefficiency, and inequities of voluntary participation\").~    ~    ~      39~      Compared with traditional \"command and control,\" price, or output regulation, this kind of regulation which relies upon self-regulation through industry trade associations and upon the dissemination of information is more consistent, not less consistent, with producer choice. It is difficult to see why a Constitution that seeks to protect individual freedom would consider the absence of \"heavy regulation,\" ante, at 6, to amount to a special, determinative reason for refusing to permit this less intrusive program. If the Court classifies the former, more comprehensive regulatory scheme as \"economic regulation\" for First Amendment purposes, it should similarly classify the latter, which does not differ significantly but for the comparatively greater degree of freedom that it allows.~    ~    ~      40~      The Court invokes in support of its conclusion other First Amendment precedent, namely, Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U.S. 209 (1977), Keller v. State Bar of Cal., 496 U.S. 1 (1990), West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943), and Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705 (1977). But those cases are very different. The first two, Abood and Keller, involved compelled contributions by employees to trade unions and by lawyers to state bar associations, respectively. This Court held that the compelled contributions were unlawful (1) to the extent that they helped fund subsidiary activities of the organization, i.e., activities other than those that legally justified a compelled contribution; and (2) because the subsidiary activities in question were political activities that might \"conflict with one's 'freedom of belief.' \" Wileman, supra, at 471 (quoting Abood, supra, at 235). See Keller, supra, at 15 (communications involving abortion, prayer in the public schools, and gun control); Abood, supra, at 213 (communications involving politics and religion).~    ~    ~      41~      By contrast, the funded activities here, like identical activities in Wileman, do not involve this kind of expression. In Wileman we described the messages at issue as incapable of \"engender[ing] any crisis of conscience\" and the producers' objections as \"trivial.\" 521 U.S., at 471, 472. The messages here are indistinguishable. Compare Brief for Respondent 10-11 (objecting to advertising because it treats branded and unbranded mushrooms alike, associates mushrooms \"with the consumption of alcohol and   tout[s] mushrooms as an aphrodisiac\"), with Wileman, supra, at 467, n. 10 (dismissing objections to advertising that suggested \" 'all varieties of California fruit to be of equal quality,' \" and included \" 'sexually subliminal messages as evidenced by an ad depicting a young girl in a wet bathing suit' \") (quoting District Court opinion). See also Appendix, infra. The compelled contribution here relates directly to the regulatory program's basic goal.~    ~    ~      42~      Neither does this case resemble either Barnette or Wooley. Barnette involved compelling children, contrary to their conscience, to salute the American flag. 319 U.S., at 632. Wooley involved compelling motorists, contrary to their conscience, to display license plates bearing the State's message \"Live Free or Die.\" 430 U.S., at 707. In Wileman we found Barnette and Wooley, and all of \"our compelled speech case law   clearly inapplicable\" to compelled financial support of generic advertising. 521 U.S., at 470. See also Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U.S. 626, 651 (1985) (refusing to apply Wooley and Barnette in a commercial context where \"the interests at stake in this case are not of the same order\"). We explained:~    ~    ~      43~      \"The use of assessments to pay for advertising does not require respondents to repeat an objectionable message out of their own mouths, cf. West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 632 (1943), require them to use their own property to convey an antagonistic ideological message, cf. Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705 (1977); Pacific Gas  Elec. Co. v. Public Util. Comm'n of Cal., 475 U.S. 1, 18 (1986) (plurality opinion), force them to respond to a hostile message when they 'would prefer to remain silent,' see ibid., or require them to be publicly identified or associated with another's message, cf. PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74, 88 (1980). Respondents are   merely required to make contributions for advertising.\" Wileman, supra, at 470-471.~    ~    ~      44~      These statements are no less applicable to the present case. How can the Court today base its holding on Barnette, Wooley, Abood, and Keller the very same cases that we expressly distinguished in Wileman?~    ~    II~    ~      45~      Nearly every human action that the law affects, and virtually all governmental activity, involves speech. For First Amendment purposes this Court has distinguished among contexts in which speech activity might arise, applying special speech-protective rules and presumptions in some of those areas, but not in others. See, e.g., Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth, 529 U.S. 217, 229 (2000) (indicating that less restrictive rules apply to governmental speech); Central Hudson Gas  Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U.S. 557, 564 (1980) (commercial speech subject to \"mid-level\" scrutiny); Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968) (applying special rules applicable to speech of government employees). Were the Court not to do so were it to apply the strictest level of scrutiny in every area of speech touched by law it would, at a minimum, create through its First Amendment analysis a serious obstacle to the operation of well-established, legislatively created, regulatory programs, thereby seriously hindering the operation of that democratic self-government that the Constitution seeks to create and to protect. Cf. Post, The Constitutional Status of Commercial Speech, 48 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 9-10 (2000).~    ~    ~      46~      That, I believe, is why it is important to understand that the regulatory program before us is a \"species of economic regulation,\" Wileman, 521 U.S., at 477, which does not \"warrant special First Amendment scrutiny,\" id., at 474. Irrespective of Wileman I would so characterize the program for three reasons.~    ~    ~      47~      First, the program does not significantly interfere with protected speech interests. It does not compel speech itself; it compels the payment of money. Money and speech are not identical. Cf. Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U.S. 377, 388-389 (2000); id., at 398 (Stevens, J., concurring) (\"Money is property; it is not speech\"); id., at 400 (Breyer, J., concurring) (\"[A] decision to contribute money to a campaign is a matter of First Amendment concern not because money is speech (it is not); but because it enables speech\"). Indeed, the contested requirement that individual producers make a payment to help achieve a governmental objective resembles a targeted tax. See Southworth, 529 U.S., at 241 (Souter, J., joined by Stevens and Breyer, JJ., concurring in judgment) (\"[T]he university fee at issue is a tax\"). And the \"government, as a general rule, may support valid programs and policies by taxes or other exactions binding on protesting parties.\" Id., at 229 (majority opinion). Cf. Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U.S. 540, 547 (1983) (\"Legislatures have especially broad latitude in creating classifications and distinctions in tax statutes\").~    ~    ~      48~      Second, this program furthers, rather than hinders, the basic First Amendment \"commercial speech\" objective. The speech at issue amounts to ordinary product promotion within the commercial marketplace an arena typically characterized both by the need for a degree of public supervision and the absence of a special democratic need to protect the channels of public debate, i.e., the communicative process itself. Cf. Post, supra, at 14-15. No one here claims that the mushroom producers are restrained from contributing to a public debate, moving public opinion, writing literature, creating art, invoking the processes of democratic self-government, or doing anything else more central to the First Amendment's concern with democratic self-government.~    ~    ~      49~      When purely commercial speech is at issue, the Court has described the First Amendment's basic objective as protection of the consumer's interest in the free flow of truthful commercial information. See, e.g., Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U.S. 761, 766 (1993) (\"First Amendment coverage of commercial speech is designed to safeguard\" society's \"interes[t] in broad access to complete and accurate commercial information\"); Zauderer, 471 U.S., at 651 (\"[T]he extension of First Amendment protection to commercial speech is justified principally by the value to consumers of the information\"); Central Hudson, 447 U.S., at 563 (\"The First Amendment's concern for commercial speech is based on the informational function of advertising\"); First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 783 (1978) (\"A commercial advertisement is constitutionally protected not so much because it pertains to the seller's business as because it furthers the societal interest in the 'free flow of commercial information' \") (quoting Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 748, 764 (1976)). Unlike many of the commercial speech restrictions this Court has previously addressed, the program before us promotes the dissemination of truthful information to consumers. And to sustain the objecting producer's constitutional claim will likely make less information, not more information, available. Perhaps that is why this Court has not previously applied \"compelled speech\" doctrine to strike down laws requiring provision of additional commercial speech.~    ~    ~      50~      Third, there is no special risk of other forms of speech-related harm. As I have previously pointed out, and Wileman held, there is no risk of significant harm to an individual's conscience. Supra, at 5-7. The program does not censor producer views unrelated to its basic regulatory justification. Supra, at 2. And there is little risk of harming any \"discrete, little noticed grou[p].\" Ante, at 4. The Act excludes small producers, 7 U.S.C.  6102(6), (11) (exempting those who import or produce less than 500,000 pounds of mushrooms annually) unlike respondent, a large, influential corporation. The Act contains methods for implementing its requirements democratically. See 6104(b)(1)(B), (g)(2) (Mushroom Council, which sets assessment rate, is composed entirely of industry representatives); 6105(a), (b) (referendum required before Secretary of Agriculture's order can go into effect and five years thereafter, and producers may request additional referenda). And the Act provides for supervision by the Secretary. 6104(d)(3) (requiring Secretary to approve all advertising programs). See also Wileman, 521 U.S., at 477 (refusing to upset \"the judgment of the majority of market participants, bureaucrats, and legislators who have concluded that [collective advertising] programs are beneficial\"). These safeguards protect against abuse of the program, such as \"making one entrepreneur finance advertising for the benefit of his competitors.\" Ante, at 2 (Stevens, J., concurring). Indeed, there is no indication here that the generic advertising promotes some brands but not others. And any \"debat[e]\" about branded versus nonbranded mushrooms, ante, at 5 (majority opinion), is identical to that in Wileman. Supra, at 5-6.~    ~    ~      51~      Taken together, these circumstances lead me to classify this common example of government intervention in the marketplace as involving a form of economic regulation, not \"commercial speech,\" for purposes of applying First Amendment presumptions. And seen as such, I cannot find the program lacks sufficient justification to survive constitutional scrutiny. Wileman, supra, at 476-477.~    ~    ~      52~      The Court, in applying stricter First Amendment standards and finding them violated, sets an unfortunate precedent. That precedent suggests, perhaps requires, striking down any similar program that, for example, would require tobacco companies to contribute to an industry fund for advertising the harms of smoking or would use a portion of museum entry charges for a citywide campaign to promote the value of art. Moreover, because of its uncertainty as to how much governmental involvement will produce a form of immunity under the \"government speech\" doctrine, see ante, at 10-11, the Court infects more traditional regulatory requirements those related, say, to warranties or to health or safety information with constitutional doubt.~    ~    ~      53~      Alternatively, the Court's unreasoned distinction between heavily regulated and less heavily regulated speakers could lead to less First Amendment protection in that it would deprive the former of protection. But see Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U.S. 530, 534, n. 1 (1980) (Even \"heavily regulated businesses may enjoy constitutional protection\") (citing, as an example, Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, supra, at 763-765).~    ~    ~      54~      At a minimum, the holding here, when contrasted with that in Wileman, creates an incentive to increase the Government's involvement in any information-based regulatory program, thereby unnecessarily increasing the degree of that program's restrictiveness. I do not believe the First Amendment seeks to limit the Government's economic regulatory choices in this way any more than does the Due Process Clause. Cf. Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45 (1905).~    ~    III~    ~      55~      Even if I were to classify the speech at issue here as \"commercial speech\" and apply the somewhat more stringent standard set forth in the Court's commercial speech cases, I would reach the same result. That standard permits restrictions where they \"directly advance\" a \"substantial\" government interest that could not \"be served as well by a more limited restriction.\" Central Hudson, 447 U.S., at 564. I have already explained why I believe the Government interest here is substantial, at least when compared with many typical regulatory goals. Supra, at 4. It remains to consider whether the restrictions are needed to advance its objective.~    ~    ~      56~      Several features of the program indicate that its speech-related aspects, i.e., its compelled monetary contributions, are necessary and proportionate to the legitimate promotional goals that it seeks. At the legislative hearings that led to enactment of the Act, industry representatives made clear that pre-existing efforts that relied upon voluntary contributions had not worked. Thus, compelled contributions may be necessary to maintain a collective advertising program in that rational producers would otherwise take a free ride on the expenditures of others. See supra, at 4; Abood, 431 U.S., at 222 (relying upon \"free rider\" justification in union context).~    ~    ~      57~      At the same time, those features of the program that led Wileman's dissenters to find its program disproportionately restrictive are absent here. Wileman's statutory scheme covered various different agricultural commodities and imposed a patchwork of geographically based limitations while \"prohibit[ing] orders of national scope\" all for no apparent reason. 521 U.S., at 499 (Souter, J., dissenting). The law at issue here, however, applies only to mushrooms, and says explicitly that \"[a]ny\" mushroom order \"shall be national in scope.\" 7 U.S.C.  6103(a). Cf. Wileman, supra, at 493 (Souter, J., dissenting) (\"[I]f the Government were to attack these problems across an interstate market for a given agricultural commodity or group of them, the substantiality of the national interest would not be open to apparent question  \").~    ~    ~      58~      Nor has the Government relied upon \"[m]ere speculation\" about the effect of the advertising. Wileman, supra, at 501 (Souter, J., dissenting). Rather, it has provided empirical evidence demonstrating the program's effect. See Food Marketing  Economics Group, Mushroom Council Program Effectiveness Review, 1999, p. 6 (Feb. 2000), lodging for United States (available in Clerk of Court's case file) (finding that \"for every million dollars spent by the Mushroom Council   the growth rate [of mushroom sales] increases by 2.1%\"). In consequence, whatever harm the program may cause First Amendment interests is proportionate. Cf. Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U.S. ___ (2001) (Breyer, J., concurring).~    ~    ~      59~      The Court's decision converts \"a question of economic policy for Congress and the Executive\" into a \"First Amendment issue,\" contrary to Wileman. 521 U.S., at 468 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Nor can its holding find support in basic First Amendment principles.~    ~    For these reasons, I dissent~    ",

Readers are requested to notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D. C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION, PETITIONERv.COLORADO REPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE~    00-191~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued February 28, 2001June 25, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      In Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 12-59, this Court held that the limitations on political campaign contributions in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 were generally constitutional, but that the Act's limitations on election expenditures infringed political expression in violation of the First Amendment. Later cases have respected this line between contributing and spending. The distinction's simplicity is qualified, however, by the Act's provision for a functional, not formal, definition of \"contribution,\" which includes \"expenditures made by any person in cooperation, consultation, or concert, with   a candidate,\" 2 U.S.C.  441a(a)(7)(B)(i). Thus, expenditures coordinated with a candidate are contributions under the Act. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) originally took the position that any expenditure by a political party in connection with a federal election was presumed to be coordinated with the party's candidate. See, e.g., Federal Election Comm'n v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Comm., 454 U.S. 27, 28-29, n. 1. The FEC thus assumed that all expenditure limits imposed on political parties were, in essence, contribution limits and therefore constitutional. Such limits include 441a(d)(3), which imposes spending limits on national and state political parties with respect to United States Senate elections. In Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal Election Comm'n, 518 U.S. 604 (Colorado I), the spending limits in 441a(d)(3) (referred to as the Party Expenditure Provision), were held unconstitutional as applied to the independent expenditures of the Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee (Party) in connection with a senatorial campaign. The principal opinion ruled the payments \"independent, \" rather than coordinated, expenditures under this Court's cases because the Party spent the money before selecting its own senatorial candidate and without any arrangement with potential nominees. Id., at 613-614. The principal opinion remanded the Party's broader claim that all limits on a party's congressional campaign expenditures are facially unconstitutional and thus unenforceable even as to spending coordinated with a candidate. Id., at 623-626. On remand, the District Court held for the Party on that claim, and a divided Tenth Circuit panel affirmed.~      Held: Because a party's coordinated expenditures, unlike expenditures truly independent, may be restricted to minimize circumvention of the Act's contribution limits, the Party's facial challenge is rejected. Pp. 4-30.~      (a) Political expenditure limits deserve closer scrutiny than contribution restrictions, e.g., Buckley, 424 U.S., at 14-23, because expenditure restraints generally curb more expressive and associational activity than contribution limits, e.g., id., at 19-23, and because unlimited contributions are more clearly linked to political corruption than other kinds of unlimited political spending, at least where the spending is not coordinated with a candidate or his campaign. E.g., id., at 47. Although the First Amendment line is easy to draw when it falls between independent expenditures by individuals or political action committees (PACs) without any candidate's approval and contributions in the form of cash gifts to candidates, see, e.g., id., at 19-23, facts speak less clearly once the independence of the spending cannot be taken for granted. Congress's functional treatment of coordinated expenditures by individuals and nonparty groups like contributions prevents attempts to circumvent the Act through coordinated expenditures amounting to disguised contributions. Id., at 47. Buckley, in fact, enhanced the significance of this functional treatment by striking down independent expenditure limits on First Amendment grounds while upholding limitations on contributions (by individuals and nonparty groups), as defined to include coordinated expenditures. Id., at 23-59. Colorado I addressed the FEC's effort to stretch the functional treatment one step further. Because Buckley had treated some coordinated expenditures like contributions and upheld their limitation, the FEC's argument went, the Party Expenditure Provision should stand as applied to all party election spending, see, e.g., 518 U.S., at 619-623. Holding otherwise, the principal opinion found that, because \"independent\" party expenditures are no more likely to serve corruption than independent expenditures by anyone else, there was no justification for subjecting party election spending across the board to the kinds of limits previously invalidated when applied to individuals and nonparty groups. See id., at 616. But that still left the question whether the First Amendment allows coordinated election expenditures by parties to be treated functionally as contributions, the way coordinated expenditures by other entities are treated. The issue in this case is, accordingly, whether a party is in a different position from other political speakers, giving it a claim to demand a higher standard of scrutiny before its coordinated spending can be limited. Pp. 4-9.~      (b) The Party's argument that its coordinated spending, like its independent spending, should be left free from restriction under the Buckley line of cases boils down to this: because a party's most important speech is aimed at electing candidates and is itself expressed through those candidates, any limit on party support for a candidate imposes a unique First Amendment burden. Limitation of any party expenditure coordinated with a candidate, the Party contends, is therefore a serious, rather than incidental, imposition on the party's speech and associative purpose, which justifies a stricter level of scrutiny than has been applied to analogous limits on individuals and nonparty groups. But whatever level of scrutiny is applied to such a limit, the Party argues, the burden on a party reflects a fatal mismatch between the effects of limiting coordinated party expenditures and the prevention of corruption or its appearance. In contrast, the Government's argument for characterizing coordinated spending like contributions goes back to Buckley, which, in effect, subjected limits on coordinated expenditures by individuals and nonparty groups to the same scrutiny it applied to limits on their cash contributions. The standard of scrutiny requires the limit to be closely drawn to match a sufficiently important interest, though the limit's dollar amount need not be fine tuned. See, e.g., Buckley, supra, at 25, 30. The Government develops this rationale a step further here, arguing that a party's coordinated spending should be limited not only because it is like a party contribution, but because giving a party the right to make unlimited coordinated expenditures would induce those wishing to support a nominee to contribute to the party in order to finance coordinated spending for that candidate, thereby increasing circumvention and bypassing the limits Buckley upheld. Pp. 9-12.~      (c) Although each of the competing positions is plausible at first blush, evaluation of the arguments prompts rejection of the Party's claim to suffer a burden unique in any way that should make a categorical difference under the First Amendment. And the Government's contentions are ultimately borne out by evidence, entitling it to prevail in its characterization of party coordinated spending as the functional equivalent of contributions. Pp. 12-25.~      (1) The Party's argument that unrestricted coordinated spending is essential to a party's nature because of its unique relationship with candidates, has been rendered implausible by nearly 30 years' history under the Act. Since 1974, a party's coordinated spending in a given race has been limited by the provision challenged here (or its predecessor). It was not until the 1996 Colorado I decision that any spending was allowed above that amount, and since then only independent spending has been unlimited. Thus, the Party's claim that coordinated spending beyond the Act's limit is essential to its very function as a party amounts implicitly to saying that for almost three decades political parties have not been quite functional or have been functioning in systematic violation of the law. The Court cannot accept either implication. Pp. 13-15.~      (2) There is a different weakness in the seemingly unexceptionable premise that parties are organized for the purpose of electing candidates, so that imposing on the way parties serve that function is uniquely burdensome. The fault here is a refusal to see how the power of money actually works in the political structure. Looking directly at a party's function in getting and spending money, it would ignore reality to think that the party role is adequately described by speaking generally of electing particular candidates. Parties are necessarily the instruments of some contributors, such as PACs, whose object is not to support the party's message or to elect party candidates, but rather to support a specific candidate for the sake of a position on one, narrow issue, or even to support any candidate who will be obliged to contributors. Parties thus perform functions more complex than simply electing their candidates: they act as agents for spending on behalf of those who seek to produce obligated officeholders. It is this party role, which functionally unites parties with other self-interested political actors, that the Party Expenditure Provision targets. Pp. 15-17.~      (3) The Court agrees insofar as the Party suggests that its strong working relationship with candidates and its unique ability to speak in coordination with them should be taken into account in the First Amendment analysis. It is the accepted understanding that a party combines its members' power to speak by aggregating their contributions and broadcasting its messages more widely than its individual contributors generally could afford to do, and it marshals this power with greater sophistication than individuals generally could, using such mechanisms as speech coordinated with a candidate. Cf. Colorado I, supra, at 637. It does not, however, follow from a party's efficiency in getting large sums and spending intelligently that limits on a party's coordinated spending should be scrutinized under an unusually high standard. In fact, any argument from sophistication and power would cut both ways. On the one hand, one can seek the benefit of stricter scrutiny of a law capping party coordinated spending by emphasizing the heavy burden imposed by limiting the most effective mechanism of sophisticated spending. And yet it is exactly this efficiency culminating in coordinated spending that (on the Government's view) places a party in a position to be used to circumvent contribution limits that apply to individuals and PACs, and thereby to exacerbate the threat of corruption and apparent corruption that those contribution limits are aimed at reducing. Pp. 17-19.~      (4) The preceding question assumes that parties enjoy a power and experience that sets them apart from other political spenders. But in fact the assumption is too crude. Like a party, rich individual donors, media executives, and PACs have the means to speak loudly and the capacity to work in tandem with a candidate. Yet all of them are subject to the coordinated spending limits upheld in Buckley, supra, at 46-47. A party is also like some of these political actors in its right under Colorado I to spend money in support of a candidate without legal limit so long as it spends independently. A party is not, therefore, in a unique position, but is in the same position as some individuals and PACs. Pp. 19-20.~      (5) Because the Party's arguments do not pan out, the Court applies to a party's coordinated spending limitation the same scrutiny it has applied to the other political actors, that is, scrutiny appropriate for a contribution limit, enquiring whether the restriction is \"closely drawn\" to match the \"sufficiently important\" government interest in combating political corruption. E.g., Shrink Missouri, supra, at 387-388. Pp. 20-21.~      (d) Under that standard, adequate evidentiary grounds exist to sustain the coordinated spending limit for parties. Substantial evidence demonstrates how candidates, donors, and parties test the current law's limits, and it shows beyond serious doubt how those contribution limits would be eroded if inducement to circumvent them were enhanced by declaring parties' coordinated spending wide open. Under the Act, a donor is limited to $2,000 in contributions to one candidate in a given election cycle. The same donor may give as much as another $20,000 each year to a national party committee supporting the candidate. The evidence shows that what a realist would expect to occur has occurred. Donors give to the party with the tacit understanding that the favored candidate will benefit. Testimony shows that, although the understanding between donor and party may involve no definite commitment and may be tacit on the donor's part, the frequency of the practice and the volume of money involved has required parties to adopt tallying procedures to connect donors to candidates. If suddenly every dollar of spending could be coordinated with the candidate, the inducement to circumvent would almost certainly intensify. Pp. 21-25.~      (e) The Party's attempts to minimize the threat of corruption by circumvention are unavailing. Its claim that most contributions to parties are small, with negligible corrupting momentum to be carried through the party conduit, is unpersuasive given the evidence that, even under present law, substantial donations turn the parties into matchmakers whose special meetings and receptions give donors the chance to get their points across to the candidates. The fact that incumbent candidates give more excess campaign funds to parties than parties spend on coordinated expenditures does not defuse concern over circumvention; if party contributions were not used as a funnel from donors to candidates, there would be no reason for the tallying system described by the witnesses. Finally, the Court rejects the Party's claim that, even if there is a circumvention threat, the First Amendment demands a response better tailored to that threat than a limitation on coordinated spending. First, the Party's suggestion that better crafted safeguards are already in place in 441a(a)(8) which provides that contributions that are earmarked or otherwise directed through an intermediary to a candidate are treated as contributions to the candidate ignores the practical difficulty of identifying and directly combating circumvention when contributions go into a general party treasury and candidate-fundraisers are rewarded with something less obvious than dollar-for-dollar pass-throughs. Second, although the Party's call for replacing limits on parties' coordinated expenditures with limits on contributions to parties is based in part on reasoning in Buckley, supra, at 44, and Colorado I, supra, at 617, those cases ultimately turned on the understanding that the expenditures at issue were independent and therefore functionally true expenditures, whereas, here, just the opposite is true. Pp. 26-30.213 F.3d 1221, reversed.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT~      Souter, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Stevens, O'Connor, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.~      Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      In Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal Election Comm'n, 518 U.S. 604 (1996) (Colorado I), we held that spending limits set by the Federal Election Campaign Act were unconstitutional as applied to the Colorado Republican Party's independent expenditures in connection with a senatorial campaign. We remanded for consideration of the party's claim that all limits on expenditures by a political party in connection with congressional campaigns are facially unconstitutional and thus unenforceable even as to spending coordinated with a candidate. Today we reject that facial challenge to the limits on parties' coordinated expenditures.~    ~    ~      2~      * We first examined the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976) (per curiam), where we held that the Act's limitations on contributions to a candidate's election campaign were generally constitutional, but that limitations on election expenditures were not. Id., at 12-59. Later cases have respected this line between contributing and spending. See, e.g., Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U.S. 377, 386-388 (2000); Colorado I, supra, at 610, 614-615; Federal Election Comm'n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U.S. 238, 259-260 (1986).~    ~    ~      3~      The simplicity of the distinction is qualified, however, by the Act's provision for a functional, not formal, definition of \"contribution,\" which includes \"expenditures made by any person in cooperation, consultation, or concert, with, or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, his authorized political committees, or their agents,\" 2 U.S.C.  441a(a)(7)(B)(i).1 Expenditures coordinated with a candidate, that is, are contributions under the Act.~    ~    ~      4~      The Federal Election Commission originally took the position that any expenditure by a political party in connection with a particular election for federal office was presumed to be coordinated with the party's candidate. See Federal Election Comm'n v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Comm., 454 U.S. 27, 28-29, n. 1 (1981); Brief for Petitioner 6-7. The Commission thus operated on the assumption that all expenditure limits imposed on political parties were, in essence, contribution limits and therefore constitutional. Brief for Respondent in Colorado I, O.T. 1995, No. 95-489, pp. 28-30. Such limits include 2 U.S.C.  441a(d)(3), which provides that in elections for the United States Senate, each national or state party committee2 is limited to spending the greater of $20,000 (adjusted for inflation, 441a(c)) or two cents multiplied by the voting age population of the State in which the election is held, 441a(d)(3)(A).3~    ~    ~      5~      Colorado I was an as-applied challenge to 441a(d)(3) (which we spoke of as the Party Expenditure Provision), occasioned by the Commission's enforcement action against the Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee (Party) for exceeding the campaign spending limit through its payments for radio advertisements attacking Democratic Congressman and senatorial candidate Timothy Wirth. Colorado I, supra, at 612-613. The Party defended in part with the claim that the party expenditure limitations violated the First Amendment, and the principal opinion in Colorado I agreed that the limitations were unconstitutional as applied to the advertising expenditures at issue. Unlike the Commission, the Members of the Court who joined the principal opinion thought the payments were \"independent expenditures\" as that term had been used in our prior cases, owing to the facts that the Party spent the money before selecting its own senatorial candidate and without any arrangement with potential nominees. Colorado I, 518 U.S., at 613-614 (opinion of Breyer, J.).~    ~    ~      6~      The Party's broader claim remained: that although prior decisions of this Court had upheld the constitutionality of limits on coordinated expenditures by political speakers other than parties, the congressional campaign expenditure limitations on parties themselves are facially unconstitutional, and so are incapable of reaching party spending even when coordinated with a candidate. Id., at 623-626.4 We remanded that facial challenge, which had not been fully briefed or considered below. Ibid. On remand the District Court held for the Party, 41 F. Supp. 2d 1197 (1999), and a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed, 213 F.3d 1221 (2000).5 We granted certiorari to resolve the question left open by Colorado I, see 531 U.S. 923 (2000), and we now reverse.~    ~    II~    ~      7~      Spending for political ends and contributing to political candidates both fall within the First Amendment's protection of speech and political association. Buckley, 424 U.S., at 14-23. But ever since we first reviewed the 1971 Act, we have understood that limits on political expenditures deserve closer scrutiny than restrictions on political contributions. Ibid; see also, e.g., Shrink Missouri, 528 U.S., at 386-388; Colorado I, supra, at 610, 614-615; Massachusetts Citizens for Life, 479 U.S., at 259-260. Restraints on expenditures generally curb more expressive and associational activity than limits on contributions do. Shrink Missouri, supra, at 386-388; Colorado I, supra, at 615; Buckley, 424 U.S., at 19-23. A further reason for the distinction is that limits on contributions are more clearly justified by a link to political corruption than limits on other kinds of unlimited political spending are (corruption being understood not only as quid pro quo agreements, but also as undue influence on an officerholder's judgment, and the appearance of such influence, Shrink Missouri, supra, at 388-389). At least this is so where the spending is not coordinated with a candidate or his campaign. Colorado I, supra, at 615; Buckley, 424 U.S., at 47. In Buckley we said that:~    ~    ~      8~      \"[u]nlike contributions,   independent expenditures may well provide little assistance to the candidate's campaign and indeed may prove counterproductive. The absence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate or his agent not only undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate, but also alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate.\" Ibid.Given these differences, we have routinely struck down limitations on independent expenditures by candidates, other individuals, and groups, see Federal Election Comm'n v. National Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U.S. 480, 490-501 (1985) (political action committees); Buckley, supra, at 39-58 (individuals, groups, candidates, and campaigns),6 while repeatedly upholding contribution limits, see Shrink Missouri, supra (contributions by political action committees); California Medical Assn. v. Federal Election Comm'n, 453 U.S. 182, 193-199 (1981) (contributions by individuals and associations); Buckley, supra, at 23-36 (contributions by individuals, groups, and political committees).7~    ~    ~      9~      The First Amendment line between spending and donating is easy to draw when it falls between independent expenditures by individuals or political action committees (PACs) without any candidate's approval (or wink or nod), and contributions in the form of cash gifts to candidates. See, e.g., Shrink Missouri, supra, at 386-388; Buckley, supra, at 19-23.8 But facts speak less clearly once the independence of the spending cannot be taken for granted, and money spent by an individual or PAC according to an arrangement with a candidate is therefore harder to classify. As already seen, Congress drew a functional, not a formal, line between contributions and expenditures when it provided that coordinated expenditures by individuals and nonparty groups are subject to the Act's contribution limits, 2 U.S.C.  441a(a)(7)(B)(i); Colorado I, 518 U.S., at 611. In Buckley, the Court acknowledged Congress's functional classification, 424 U.S., at 46-47, and n. 53, and observed that treating coordinated expenditures as contributions \"prevent[s] attempts to circumvent the Act through prearranged or coordinated expenditures amounting to disguised contributions,\" id., at 47. Buckley, in fact, enhanced the significance of this functional treatment by striking down independent expenditure limits on First Amendment grounds while upholding limitations on contributions (by individuals and nonparty groups), as defined to include coordinated expenditures, id., at 23-59.9~    ~    ~      10~      Colorado I addressed the FEC's effort to stretch the functional treatment of coordinated expenditures further than the plain application of the statutory definition. As we said, the FEC argued that parties and candidates are coupled so closely that all of a party's expenditures on an election campaign are coordinated with its candidate; because Buckley had treated some coordinated expenditures like contributions and upheld their limitation, the argument went, the Party Expenditure Provision should stand as applied to all party election spending. See Brief for Respondent in Colorado I, O.T. 1995, No. 95-489, pp. 28-30; see also Colorado I, supra, at 619-623. Colorado I held otherwise, however, the principal opinion's view being that some party expenditures could be seen as \"independent\" for constitutional purposes. 518 U.S., at 614. The principal opinion found no reason to see these expenditures as more likely to serve or be seen as instruments of corruption than independent expenditures by anyone else. So there was no justification for subjecting party election spending across the board to the kinds of limits previously invalidated when applied to individuals and nonparty groups. The principal opinion observed that \"[t]he independent expression of a political party's views is 'core' First Amendment activity no less than is the independent expression of individuals, candidates, or other political committees.\" Id., at 616. Since the FEC did not advance any other convincing reason for refusing to draw the independent-coordinated line accepted since Buckley, see National Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U.S., at 497-498; Buckley, supra, at 46-47, that was the end of the case so far as it concerned independent spending. Colorado I, supra, at 617-623.~    ~    ~      11~      But that still left the question whether the First Amendment allows coordinated election expenditures by parties to be treated functionally as contributions, the way coordinated expenditures by other entities are treated. Colorado I found no justification for placing parties at a disadvantage when spending independently; but was there a case for leaving them entirely free to coordinate unlimited spending with candidates when others could not? The principal opinion in Colorado I noted that coordinated expenditures \"share some of the constitutionally relevant features of independent expenditures.\" 518 U.S., at 624. But it also observed that \"many [party coordinated expenditures] are . . . virtually indistinguishable from simple contributions.\" Ibid. Coordinated spending by a party, in other words, covers a spectrum of activity, as does coordinated spending by other political actors. The issue in this case is, accordingly, whether a party is otherwise in a different position from other political speakers, giving it a claim to demand a generally higher standard of scrutiny before its coordinated spending can be limited. The issue is posed by two questions: does limiting coordinated spending impose a unique burden on parties, and is there reason to think that coordinated spending by a party would raise the risk of corruption posed when others spend in coordination with a candidate? The issue is best viewed through the positions developed by the Party and the Government in this case.~    ~    III~    ~      12~      The Party's argument that its coordinated spending, like its independent spending, should be left free from restriction under the Buckley line of cases boils down to this: because a party's most important speech is aimed at electing candidates and is itself expressed through those candidates, any limit on party support for a candidate imposes a unique First Amendment burden. See Brief for Respondent 26-31. The point of organizing a party, the argument goes, is to run a successful candidate who shares the party's policy goals. Id., at 26. Therefore, while a campaign contribution is only one of several ways that individuals and nonparty groups speak and associate politically, see Shrink Missouri, 528 U.S., at 386-387; Buckley, 424 U.S., at 20-22, financial support of candidates is essential to the nature of political parties as we know them. And coordination with a candidate is a party's natural way of operating, not merely an option that can easily be avoided. Brief for Respondent 26. Limitation of any party expenditure coordinated with a candidate, the Party contends, is therefore a serious, rather than incidental, imposition on the party's speech and associative purpose, and that justifies a stricter level of scrutiny than we have applied to analogous limits on individuals and nonparty groups. But whatever level of scrutiny is applied, the Party goes on to argue, the burden on a party reflects a fatal mismatch between the effects of limiting coordinated party expenditures and the prevention of corruption or the appearance of it. Brief for Respondent 20-22, 25-32; see also 213 F.3d, at 1227.~    ~    ~      13~      The Government's argument for treating coordinated spending like contributions goes back to Buckley. There, the rationale for endorsing Congress's equation of coordinated expenditures and contributions was that the equation \"prevent[s] attempts to circumvent the Act through prearranged or coordinated expenditures amounting to disguised contributions.\" 424 U.S., at 47. The idea was that coordinated expenditures are as useful to the candidate as cash, and that such \"disguised contributions\" might be given \"as a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate\" (in contrast to independent expenditures, which are poor sources of leverage for a spender because they might be duplicative or counterproductive from a candidate's point of view). Ibid. In effect, therefore, Buckley subjected limits on coordinated expenditures by individuals and nonparty groups to the same scrutiny it applied to limits on their cash contributions. The standard of scrutiny requires the limit to be \" 'closely drawn' to match a 'sufficiently important interest,'   though the dollar amount of the limit need not be 'fine tun[ed],' \" Shrink Missouri, supra, at 387-388 (quoting Buckley, supra, at 25, 30).~    ~    ~      14~      The Government develops this rationale a step further in applying it here. Coordinated spending by a party should be limited not only because it is like a party contribution, but for a further reason. A party's right to make unlimited expenditures coordinated with a candidate would induce individual and other nonparty contributors to give to the party in order to finance coordinated spending for a favored candidate beyond the contribution limits binding on them. The Government points out that a degree of circircumvention is occurring under present law (which allows unlimited independent spending and some coordinated spending). Individuals and nonparty groups who have reached the limit of direct contributions to a candidate give to a party with the understanding that the contribution to the party will produce increased party spending for the candidate's benefit. The Government argues that if coordinated spending were unlimited, circumvention would increase: because coordinated spending is as effective as direct contributions in supporting a candidate, an increased opportunity for coordinated spending would aggravate the use of a party to funnel money to a candidate from individuals and nonparty groups, who would thus bypass the contribution limits that Buckley upheld.~    ~    IV~    ~      15~      Each of the competing positions is plausible at first blush. Our evaluation of the arguments, however, leads us to reject the Party's claim to suffer a burden unique in any way that should make a categorical difference under the First Amendment. On the other side, the Government's contentions are ultimately borne out by evidence, entitling it to prevail in its characterization of party coordinated spending as the functional equivalent ofcontributions.~    ~    ~      16~      * In assessing the Party's argument, we start with a word about what the Party is not saying. First, we do not understand the Party to be arguing that the line between independent and coordinated expenditures is conceptually unsound when applied to a political party instead of an individual or other association. See, e.g., Brief for Respondent 29 (describing \"independent party speech\"). Indeed, the good sense of recognizing the distinction between independence and coordination was implicit in the principal opinion in Colorado I, which did not accept the notion of a \"metaphysical identity\" between party and candidate, 518 U.S., at 622-623, but rather decided that some of a party's expenditures could be understood as being independent and therefore immune to limitation just as an individual's independent expenditure would be, id., at 619-623.~    ~    ~      17~      Second, we do not understand the Party to be arguing that associations in general or political parties in particular may claim a variety of First Amendment protection that is different in kind from the speech and associational rights of their members.10 The Party's point, rather, is best understood as a factual one: coordinated spending is essential to parties because \"a party and its candidate are joined at the hip,\" Brief for Respondent 31, owing to the very conception of the party as an organization formed to elect candidates. Parties, thus formed, have an especially strong working relationship with their candidates, id., at 26, and the speech this special relationship facilitates is much more effective than independent speech, id., at 29.~    ~    ~      18~      There are two basic arguments here. The first turns on the relationship of a party to a candidate: a coordinated relationship between them so defines a party that it cannot function as such without coordinated spending, the object of which is a candidate's election. We think political history and political reality belie this argument. The second argument turns on the nature of a party as uniquely able to spend in ways that promote candidate success. We think that this argument is a double-edged sword, and one hardly limited to political parties.~    ~    ~      19~      * The assertion that the party is so joined at the hip to candidates that most of its spending must necessarily be coordinated spending is a statement at odds with the history of nearly 30 years under the Act. It is well to remember that ever since the Act was amended in 1974, coordinated spending by a party committee in a given race has been limited by the provision challenged here (or its predecessor). See 18 U.S.C.  608(f) (1970 ed., Supp. IV); see also Buckley, 424 U.S., at 194 (reprinting then-effective Party Expenditure Provision). It was not until 1996 and the decision in Colorado I that any spending was allowed above that amount, and since then only independent spending has been unlimited. As a consequence, the Party's claim that coordinated spending beyond the limit imposed by the Act is essential to its very function as a party amounts implicitly to saying that for almost three decades political parties have not been functional or have been functioning in systematic violation of the law. The Party, of course, does not in terms make either statement, and we cannot accept either implication. There is no question about the closeness of candidates to parties and no doubt that the Act affected parties' roles and their exercise of power. But the political scientists who have weighed in on this litigation observe that \"there is little evidence to suggest that coordinated party spending limits adopted by Congress have frustrated the ability of political parties to exercise their First Amendment rights to support their candidates,\" and that \"[i]n reality, political parties are dominant players, second only to the candidates themselves, in federal elections.\" Brief for Paul Allen Beck et al. as Amici Curiae 5-6. For the Party to claim after all these years of strictly limited coordinated spending that unlimited coordinated spending is essential to the nature and functioning of parties is in reality to assert just that \"metaphysical identity,\" 518 U.S., at 623, between freespending party and candidate that we could not accept in Colorado I.11~    ~    2~    ~      20~      There is a different weakness in the seemingly unexceptionable premise that parties are organized for the purpose of electing candidates, Brief for Respondent 26 (\"Parties exist precisely to elect candidates that share the goals of their party\"), so that imposing on the way parties serve that function is uniquely burdensome. The fault here is not so much metaphysics as myopia, a refusal to see how the power of money actually works in the political structure.~    ~    ~      21~      When we look directly at a party's function in getting and spending money, it would ignore reality to think that the party role is adequately described by speaking generally of electing particular candidates. The money parties spend comes from contributors with their own personal interests. PACs, for example, are frequent party contributors who (according to one of the Party's own experts) \"do not pursue the same objectives in electoral politics,\" that parties do. App. 180 (statement of Professor Anthony Corrado). PACs \"are most concerned with advancing their narrow interest[s]\" and therefore \"provide support to candidates who share their views, regardless of party affiliation.\" Ibid. In fact, many PACs naturally express their narrow interests by contributing to both parties during the same electoral cycle,12 and sometimes even directly to two competing candidates in the same election, L. Sabato, PAC Power, Inside the World of Political Action Committees 88 (1984).13 Parties are thus necessarily the instruments of some contributors whose object is not to support the party's message or to elect party candidates across the board, but rather to support a specific candidate for the sake of a position on one, narrow issue, or even to support any candidate who will be obliged to the contributors.14~    ~    ~      22~      Parties thus perform functions more complex than simply electing candidates; whether they like it or not, they act as agents for spending on behalf of those who seek to produce obligated officeholders. It is this party role, which functionally unites parties with other self-interested political actors, that the Party Expenditure Provision targets. This party role, accordingly, provides good reason to view limits on coordinated spending by parties through the same lens applied to such spending by donors, like PACs, that can use parties as conduits for contributions meant to place candidates under obligation.~    ~    3~    ~      23~      Insofar as the Party suggests that its strong working relationship with candidates and its unique ability to speak in coordination with them should be taken into account in the First Amendment analysis, we agree. It is the accepted understanding that a party combines its members' power to speak by aggregating contributions and broadcasting messages more widely than individual contributors generally could afford to do, and the party marshals this power with greater sophistication than individuals generally could, using such mechanisms as speech coordinated with a candidate. In other words, the party is efficient in generating large sums to spend and in pinpointing effective ways to spend them. Cf. Colorado I, 518 U.S., at 637 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in part) (\"Political associations allow citizens to pool their resources and make their advocacy more effective\").~    ~    ~      24~      It does not, however, follow from a party's efficiency in getting large sums and spending intelligently that limits on a party's coordinated spending should be scrutinized under an unusually high standard, and in fact any argument from sophistication and power would cut both ways. On the one hand, one can seek the benefit of stricter scrutiny of a law capping party coordinated spending by emphasizing the heavy burden imposed by limiting the most effective mechanism of sophisticated spending. And yet it is exactly this efficiency culminating in coordinated spending that (on the Government's view) places a party in a position to be used to circumvent contribution limits that apply to individuals and PACs, and thereby to exacerbate the threat of corruption and apparent corruption that those contribution limits are aimed at reducing. As a consequence, what the Party calls an unusual burden imposed by regulating its spending is not a simple premise for arguing for tighter scrutiny of limits on a party; it is the premise for a question pointing in the opposite direction. If the coordinated spending of other, less efficient and perhaps less practiced political actors can be limited consistently with the Constitution, why would the Constitution forbid regulation aimed at a party whose very efficiency in channeling benefits to candidates threatens to undermine the contribution (and hence coordinated spending) limits to which those others are unquestionably subject?~    ~    4~    ~      25~      The preceding question assumes that parties enjoy a power and experience that sets them apart from other political spenders. But in fact the assumption is too crude. While parties command bigger spending budgets than most individuals, some individuals could easily rival party committees in spending. Rich political activists crop up, and the United States has known its Citizens Kane. Their money speaks loudly, too, and they are therefore burdened by restrictions on its use just as parties are. And yet they are validly subject to coordinated spending limits, Buckley, 424 U.S., at 46-47, and so are PACs, id., at 35-36, 46-47, which may amass bigger treasuries than most party members can spare for politics.15~    ~    ~      26~      Just as rich donors, media executives, and PACs have the means to speak as loudly as parties do, they would also have the capacity to work effectively in tandem with a candidate, just as a party can do. While a candidate has no way of coordinating spending with every contributor, there is nothing hard about coordinating with someone with a fortune to donate, any more than a candidate would have difficulty in coordinating spending with an inner circle of personal political associates or with his own family. Yet all of them are subject to coordinated spending limits upheld in Buckley, supra, at 53, n. 59. A party, indeed, is now like some of these political actors in yet another way: in its right under Colorado I to spend money in support of a candidate without legal limit so long as it spends independently. A party may spend independently every cent it can raise wherever it thinks its candidate will shine, on every subject and any viewpoint.~    ~    ~      27~      A party is not, therefore, in a unique position. It is in the same position as some individuals and PACs, as to whom coordinated spending limits have already been held valid, Buckley, supra, at 46-47; and, indeed, a party is better off, for a party has the special privilege the others do not enjoy, of making coordinated expenditures up to the limit of the Party Expenditure Provision.16~    ~    5~    ~      28~      The Party's arguments for being treated differently from other political actors subject to limitation on political spending under the Act do not pan out. Despite decades of limitation on coordinated spending, parties have not been rendered useless. In reality, parties continue to organize to elect candidates, and also function for the benefit of donors whose object is to place candidates under obligation, a fact that parties cannot escape. Indeed, parties' capacity to concentrate power to elect is the very capacity that apparently opens them to exploitation as channels for circumventing contribution and coordinated spending limits binding on other political players. And some of these players could marshal the same power and sophistication for the same electoral objectives as political parties themselves.~    ~    ~      29~      We accordingly apply to a party's coordinated spending limitation the same scrutiny we have applied to the other political actors, that is, scrutiny appropriate for a contribution limit, enquiring whether the restriction is \"closely drawn\" to match what we have recognized as the \"sufficiently important\" government interest in combating political corruption. Shrink Missouri, 528 U.S., at 387-388 (quoting Buckley, supra, at 25, 30).17 With the standard thus settled, the issue remains whether adequate evidentiary grounds exist to sustain the limit under that standard, on the theory that unlimited coordinated spending by a party raises the risk of corruption (and its appearance) through circumvention of valid contribution limits. Indeed, all members of the Court agree that circumvention is a valid theory of corruption; the remaining bone of contention is evidentiary.18~    ~    B~    ~      30~      Since there is no recent experience with unlimited coordinated spending, the question is whether experience under the present law confirms a serious threat of abuse from the unlimited coordinated party spending as the Government contends. Cf. Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. 191, 208 (1992) (opinion of Blackmun, J.) (noting difficulty of mustering evidence to support long-enforced statutes). It clearly does. Despite years of enforcement of the challenged limits, substantial evidence demonstrates how candidates, donors, and parties test the limits of the current law, and it shows beyond serious doubt how contribution limits would be eroded if inducement to circumvent them were enhanced by declaring parties' coordinated spending wide open.19~    ~    ~      31~      Under the Act, a donor is limited to $2,000 in contributions to one candidate in a given election cycle. The same donor may give as much as another $20,000 each year to a national party committee supporting the candidate.20 What a realist would expect to occur has occurred. Donors give to the party with the tacit understanding that the favored candidate will benefit. See App. 247 (Declaration of Robert Hickmott, former Democratic fundraiser and National Finance Director for Timothy Wirth's Senate campaign) (\"We . . . told contributors who had made the maximum allowable contribution to the Wirth campaign but who wanted to do more that they could raise money for the DSCC so that we could get our maximum [Party Expenditure Provision] allocation from the DSCC\"); id., at 274 (declaration of Timothy Wirth) (\"I understood that when I raised funds for the DSCC, the donors expected that I would receive the amount of their donations multiplied by a certain number that the DSCC had determined in advance, assuming the DSCC has raised other funds\"); id., at 166 (declaration of Leon G. Billings, former Executive Director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC)) (\"People often contribute to party committees because they have given the maximum amount to a candidate, and want to help the candidate indirectly by contributing to the party\"); id., at 99-100 (fundraising letter from Congressman Wayne Allard, dated Aug. 27, 1996, explaining to contributor that \"you are at the limit of what you can directly contribute to my campaign,\" but \"you can further help my campaign by assisting the Colorado Republican Party\").21~    ~    ~      32~      Although the understanding between donor and party may involve no definite commitment and may be tacit on the donor's part, the frequency of the practice and the volume of money involved has required some manner of informal bookkeeping by the recipient. In the Democratic Party, at least, the method is known as \"tallying,\" a system that helps to connect donors to candidates through the accommodation of a party. See App. 246-247 (Hickmott declaration) (\"[The tally system] is an informal agreement between the DSCC and the candidates' campaigns that if you help the DSCC raise contributions, we will turn around and help your campaign\"); id., at 268 (declaration of former Senator Paul Simon) (\"Donors would be told the money they contributed could be credited to any Senate candidate. The callers would make clear that this was not a direct contribution, but it was fairly close to direct\"); id., at 165-166 (Billings declaration) (\"There appeared to be an understanding between the DSCC and the Senators that the amount of money they received from the DSCC was related to how much they raised for the Committee\").22~    ~    ~      33~      Such is the state of affairs under the current law, which requires most party spending on a candidate's behalf to be done independently, and thus less desirably from the point of view of a donor and his favored candidate. If suddenly every dollar of spending could be coordinated with the candidate, the inducement to circumvent would almost certainly intensify. Indeed, if a candidate could be assured that donations through a party could result in funds passed through to him for spending on virtually identical items as his own campaign funds, a candidate enjoying the patronage of affluent contributors would have a strong incentive not merely to direct donors to his party, but to promote circumvention as a step toward reducing the number of donors requiring time-consuming cultivation. If a candidate could arrange for a party committee to foot his bills, to be paid with $20,000 contributions to the party by his supporters, the number of donors necessary to raise $1,000,000 could be reduced from 500 (at $2,000 per cycle) to 46 (at $2,000 to the candidate and $20,000 to the party, without regard to donations outside the election year).23~    ~    V~    ~      34~      While this evidence rules out denying the potential for corruption by circumvention, the Party does try to minimize the threat. It says that most contributions to parties are small, with negligible corrupting momentum to be carried through the party conduit. Brief for Respondent 14. But some contributions are not small; they can go up to $20,000, 2 U.S.C.  441a(a)(1)(B),24 and the record shows that even under present law substantial donations turn the parties into matchmakers whose special meetings and receptions give the donors the chance to get their points across to the candidates.25 The Party again discounts the threat of outflanking contribution limits on individuals and nonparty groups by stressing that incumbent candidates give more excess campaign funds to parties than parties spend on coordinated expenditures. Brief for Respondent 34. But the fact that parties may do well for themselves off incumbents does not defuse concern over circumvention; if contributions to a party were not used as a funnel from donors to candidates, there would be no reason for using the tallying system the way the witnesses have described it.~    ~    ~      35~      Finally, the Party falls back to claiming that, even if there is a threat of circumvention, the First Amendment demands a response better tailored to that threat than a limitation on spending, even coordinated spending. Brief for Respondent 46-48. The Party has two suggestions.~    ~    ~      36~      First, it says that better crafted safeguards are in place already, in particular the earmarking rule of 441a(a)(8), which provides that contributions that \"are in any way earmarked or otherwise directed through an intermediary or conduit to [a] candidate\" are treated as contributions to the candidate. The Party says that this provision either suffices to address any risk of circumvention or would suffice if clarified to cover practices like tallying. Brief for Respondent 42, 47; see also 213 F.2d, at 1232. This position, however, ignores the practical difficulty of identifying and directly combating circumvention under actual political conditions. Donations are made to a party by contributors who favor the party's candidates in races that affect them; donors are (of course) permitted to express their views and preferences to party officials; and the party is permitted (as we have held it must be) to spend money in its own right. When this is the environment for contributions going into a general party treasury, and candidate-fundraisers are rewarded with something less obvious than dollar-for-dollar pass-throughs (distributed through contributions and party spending), circumvention is obviously very hard to trace. The earmarking provision, even if it dealt directly with tallying, would reach only the most clumsy attempts to pass contributions through to candidates. To treat the earmarking provision as the outer limit of acceptable tailoring would disarm any serious effort to limit the corrosive effects of what Chief Judge Seymour called \" 'understandings' regarding what donors give what amounts to the party, which candidates are to receive what funds from the party, and what interests particular donors are seeking to promote,\" 213 F.3d, at 1241 (dissenting opinion); see also Briffault, Political Parties and Campaign Finance Reform, 100 Colum. L. Rev 620, 652 (2000) (describing \"web of relations linking major donors, party committees, and elected officials\").26~    ~    ~      37~      The Party's second preferred prescription for the threat of an end run calls for replacing limits on coordinated expenditures by parties with limits on contributions to parties, the latter supposedly imposing a lesser First Amendment burden. Brief for Respondent 46-48. The Party thus invokes the general rule that contribution limits take a lesser First Amendment toll, expenditure limits a greater one. That was one strand of the reasoning in Buckley itself, which rejected the argument that limitations on independent expenditures by individuals, groups, and candidates were justifiable in order to avoid circumvention of contribution limitations. Buckley, 424 U.S., at 44. It was also one strand of the logic of the Colorado I principal opinion in rejecting the Party Expenditure Provision's application to independent party expenditures. 518 U. S, at 617.27~    ~    ~      38~      In each of those cases, however, the Court's reasoning contained another strand. The analysis ultimately turned on the understanding that the expenditures at issue were not potential alter egos for contributions, but were independent and therefore functionally true expenditures, qualifying for the most demanding First Amendment scrutiny employed in Buckley. Colorado I, supra, at 617; Buckley, supra, at 44-47. Thus, in Colorado I we could not assume, \"absent convincing evidence to the contrary,\" that the Party's independent expenditures formed a link in a chain of corruption-by-conduit. 518 U.S., at 617. \"[T]he absence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate or his agent not only undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate, but also alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate,\" Buckley, supra, at 47; therefore, \"the constitutionally significant fact\" in Colorado I was \"the lack of coordination between the candidate and the source of the expenditure,\" 518 U.S., at 617.~    ~    ~      39~      Here, however, just the opposite is true. There is no significant functional difference between a party's coordinated expenditure and a direct party contribution to the candidate, and there is good reason to expect that a party's right of unlimited coordinated spending would attract increased contributions to parties to finance exactly that kind of spending.28 Coordinated expenditures of money donated to a party are tailor-made to undermine contribution limits. Therefore the choice here is not, as in Buckley and Colorado I, between a limit on pure contributions and pure expenditures.29 The choice is between limiting contributions and limiting expenditures whose special value as expenditures is also the source of their power to corrupt. Congress is entitled to its choice.~    ~    ~      40~      * * *~    ~    ~      41~      We hold that a party's coordinated expenditures, unlike expenditures truly independent, may be restricted to minimize circumvention of contribution limits. We therefore reject the Party's facial challenge and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.~    ~    ~      42~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      43~      Thomas, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Scalia and Kennedy, JJ., joined, and in which Rehnquist, C. J., joined as to Part II.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~          \"Contribution\" is otherwise defined as \"any gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office\"; or \"the payment by any person of compensation for the personal services of another person which are rendered to a political committee without charge for any purpose.\" 2 U.S.C.  431(8).     The Act defines \"expenditure\" as \"any purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of money or anything of value, made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office.\" 431(9)(A)(i). A \"written contract, promise, or agreement to make an expenditure\" also counts as an expenditure. 431(9)(A)(ii).~      ~      ~        2~          A political party's \"national committee\" is the \"organization which, by virtue of the bylaws of a political party, is responsible for the day-to-day operation of such political party at the national level, as determined by the [Federal Election] Commission.\" 431(14). A \"state committee\" fills the same role at the state level. 431(15).~      ~      ~        3~          The same limits apply to campaigns for House of Representatives from States entitled to only one Representative. 441a(d)(3)(A). For other States, the limit on party expenditures in connection with House campaigns is $10,000 preadjustment. 441a(d)(3)(B). As adjusted for inflation, the 2000 Senate limits ranged from $67,560 to $1,636,438; House limits ranged from $33,780 to $67,560. 26 FEC Record 14-15 (Mar. 2000).     The FEC reads the Act to permit parties to make campaign contributions within the otherwise-applicable contribution limits, in addition to the expenditures permitted by 441a(d). See n. 16, infra.~      ~      ~        4~          The limits applicable to presidential campaigns were not at issue in Colorado I, 518 U.S. 604, 610-611 (1996), and are not at issue here, Brief for Respondent 49, n. 30.~      ~      ~        5~          Along with its constitutional claim, the Party argued to the District Court that the Party Expenditure Provision's application to independent expenditures was not severable from the other possible applications of the provision, a nonconstitutional basis for resolving the case that the Colorado I principal opinion suggested should be explored on remand. Colorado I, supra, at 625-626. The District Court rejected the nonseverability argument, 41 F. Supp. 2d, at 1207, and the Party did not renew it on appeal, 213 F.3d, at 1225, n. 3.~      ~      ~        6~          The expenditure limits invalidated in Buckley applied to candidates and their campaigns, and to \"persons.\" See Buckley, 424 U.S., at 39-40, 51, 54, 58. \"Person\" was defined as \"an individual, partnership, committee, association, corporation, or any other organization or group of persons.\" 18 U.S.C.  591(g) (1970 ed., Supp. IV); see also Buckley, 424 U.S., at 144-235 (appendix reprinting then-current Act). Although this language is broad enough to cover political parties, id., at 19, and n. 19, 39, parties with a candidate on the ballot were covered instead by the special Party Expenditure Provision, which was not challenged on First Amendment grounds, id., at 58, n. 66.~      ~      ~        7~          The contribution limits at issue in Buckley applied to \"persons\" (\"person\" again defined as \"an individual, partnership, committee, association, corporation or any other organization or group of persons,\" id., at 23). Certain groups (referred to under current law as \"muliticandidate political committees\") that registered with the FEC and met other qualifications, including making contributions to five or more candidates for federal office, were subject to a higher limit. Id., at 35. The current contribution limits appear in 2 U.S.C.  441a(a). They provide that \"persons\" (still broadly defined, see 431(11)) may contribute no more than $1,000 to a candidate \"with respect to any election for Federal office,\" $5,000 to any political committee in any year, and $20,000 to the national committees of a political party in any year. 441a(a)(1). Individuals are limited to a yearly contribution total of $25,000. 441a(a)(3). \"[M]ulticandidate political committees\" are limited to a $5,000 contribution to a candidate \"with respect to any election,\" $5,000 to any political committee in any year, and $15,000 to the national committees of a political party in any year. 441a(a)(2). Unlike the party expenditure limits, these contribution limits are not adjusted for inflation.~      ~      ~        8~          The Party does not challenge the constitutionality of limits on cash contributions from parties to candidates, Brief for Respondent 49, n. 31, which, on the FEC's reading of the Act, are imposed on parties by the generally applicable contribution limits of 2 U.S.C.  441a(a), see n. 16, infra. And the Party, unlike Justice Thomas, post, at 1 (dissenting opinion), does not call for the overruling of Buckley. Nor does the FEC ask us to revisit Buckley's general approach to expenditure limits, although some have argued that such limits could be justified in light of post-Buckley developments in campaign finance, see, e.g., Blasi, Free Speech and the Widening Gyre of Fundraising, 94 Colum. L. Rev. 1281 (1994); cf. Nixon v. Shrink Missouri, 528 U.S. 377, 409 (2000) (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (\"I would leave open the possibility that Congress, or a state legislature, might devise a system in which there are some limits on both expenditures and contributions, thus permitting officeholders to concentrate their time and efforts on official duties rather than on fundraising\"); id., at 405 (Breyer, J., concurring) (\"Suppose Buckley denies the political branches sufficient leeway to enact comprehensive solutions to the problems posed by campaign finance. If so, like Justice Kennedy, I believe the Constitution would require us to reconsider Buckley\").~      ~      ~        9~          As noted, n. 6, supra, the Party Expenditure Provision itself was not challenged on First Amendment grounds in Buckley, supra, at 58, n. 66.~      ~      ~        10~          We have repeatedly held that political parties and other associations derive rights from their members. E.g., Norman v. Reed, 502 U.S. 279, 288 (1992); Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn., 479 U.S. 208, 214-215 (1986); Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 622-623 (1984); NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 459-460 (1958); Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 250 (1957). While some commentators have assumed that associations' rights are also limited to the rights of the individuals who belong to them, e.g., Supreme Court, 1996 Term, Leading Cases, Associational Rights of Political Parties, 111 Harv. L. Rev. 197, 315, n. 50 (1977), that view has been subject to debate, see, e.g., Gottlieb, Fleshing Out the Right of Association, 49 Albany L. Rev. 825, 826, 836-837 (1985); see generally Issacharoff, Private Parties with Public Purposes, 101 Colum. L. Rev 274 (2001). There is some language in our cases supporting the position that parties' rights are more than the sum of their members' rights, e.g., California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567, 575 (2000) (referring to the \"special place\" the First Amendment reserves for the process by which a political party selects a standard bearer); Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U.S. 351, 373 (1997) (Stevens, J., dissenting), but we have never settled upon the nature of any such difference and have no reason to do so here.~      ~      ~        11~          To say that history and common sense make us skeptical that parties are uniquely incapacitated by the challenged limitations is not to deny that limiting parties' coordinated expenditures while permitting unlimited independent expenditures prompts parties to structure their spending in a way that they would not otherwise choose to do. See post, at 6-7. And we acknowledge below, infra, at 17-19, that limiting coordinated expenditures imposes some burden on parties' associational efficiency. But the very evidence cited by the dissent suggests that it is nonetheless possible for parties, like individuals and nonparty groups, to speak independently. E.g., App. 218 (statement of Professor Anthony Corrado) (\"[I]t is likely that parties will allocate an increasing amount of money to independent expenditure efforts in the future\"); id., at 159 (affidavit of Donald K. Bain, Chairman of the Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee) (describing ability to make independent expenditures as \"welcome\").~      ~      ~        12~          As former Senator Paul Simon explained, \"I believe people contribute to party committees on both sides of the aisle for the same reason that Federal Express does, because they want favors. There is an expectation that giving to party committees helps you legislatively.\" App. 270. See also id., at 269-270 (recounting debate over a bill favored by Federal Express during which a colleague exclaimed \"we've got to pay attention to who is buttering our bread\").     The FEC's public records confirm that Federal Express's PAC (along with many others) contributed to both major parties in recent elections.

For example, in United States v. Automobile Workers, 352 U.S. 567 (1957), Justice Frankfurther recounted Senator Robinson's explanation for the Federal Corrupt Practices Act's restriction of corporate campaign contributions:     \"We all know   that one of the great political evils of the time is the apparent hold on political parties which business interests and certain organizations seek and sometimes obtain by reason of liberal campaign contributions. Many believe that when an individual or association of individuals makes large contributions for the purpose of aiding candidates of political parties in winning the elections, they expect, and sometimes demand, and occasionally, at least, receive, consideration by the beneficiaries of their contributions which not infrequently is harmful to the general public interest.\" Id., at 576 (quoting 65 Cong. Rec. 9507-9508 (1924)).~      ~      ~        15~          By noting that other political actors are validly burdened by limitations on their coordinated spending, we do not mean to take a position as to the wisdom of policies that promote one source of campaign funding or another. Cf. Brief for Respondent 27, n. 17 (citing academic support for expanding the role of parties in campaign finance).~      ~      ~        16~          This is the position of the FEC in the aftermath of Colorado I: that a party committee may make coordinated expenditures up to the amount of its expenditure limit, in addition to the amount of direct contributions permitted by the generally applicable contribution limit. Brief for Petitioner 5-6, and n. 3.~      ~      ~        17~          Whether a different characterization, and hence a different type of scutiny, could be appropriate in the context of an as-applied challenge focused on application of the limit to specific expenditures is a question that, as Justice Thomas notes, post, at 4, n. 2, we need not reach in this facial challenge. Cf. Brief for Petitioner at 9, n. 5 (noting that the FEC has solicited comments regarding possible criteria for identifying coordinated expenditures).     The Party appears to argue that even if the Party Expenditure Provision is justified with regard to coordinated expenditures that amount to no more than payment of the candidate's bills, the limitation is facially invalid because of its potential application to expenditures that involve more of the party's own speech. Brief for Respondent 48-49. But the Party does not tell us what proportion of the spending falls in one category or the other, or otherwise lay the groundwork for its facial overbreadth claim. Cf. Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601 (1973) (overbreadth must be substantial to trigger facial invalidation).~      ~      ~        18~          Apart from circumvention, the FEC also argues that the Party Expenditure Provision is justified by a concern with quid pro quo arrangements and similar corrupting relationships between candidates and parties themselves, see Brief for Petitioner 33-38. We find no need to reach that argument because the evidence supports the long-recognized rationale of combating circumvention of contribution limits designed to combat the corrupting influence of large contributions to candidates from individuals and nonparty groups. The dissent does not take issue with this justification as a theoretical matter. See also 213 F.3d 1221, 1232 (CA10 2000) (Court of Appeals acknowledging circumvention as a possible \"avenue of abuse\").~      ~      ~        19~           In Colorado I, the principal opinion suggested that the Party Expenditure Provision was not enacted out of \"a special concern about the potentially 'corrupting' effect of party expenditures, but rather for the constitutionally insufficient purpose of reducing what [Congress] saw as wasteful and excessive campaign spending.\" Colorado I, 518 U.S., at 618. That observation was relevant to our examination of the Party Expenditure Provision as applied to independent expenditures, see id., at 617-618, limits on which were invalidated with regard to other political actors in Buckley in part because they were justified by concern with wasteful campaign spending, Buckley, 424 U.S., at 57. Our point in Colorado I was that there was no evidence that Congress had a special motivation regarding parties that would justify limiting their independent expenditures after similar limits imposed on other spenders had been invalidated. As for the Party Expenditure Provision's application to coordinated expenditures, on the other hand, the evidence discussed in the text suggests that the anticircumvention rationale that justifies other coordinated expenditure limits, see Buckley, supra, at 46-47, is at work here as well. The dissent ignores this distinction, post, at 11-12, but neither the dissent nor the Party seriously argues that Congress was not concerned with circumvention of contribution limits using parties as conduits. All acknowledge that Congress enacted other measures prompted by just that concern. See post, at 18; Brief for Respondent 41-42 (\"FECA provides interlocking multilayered provisions designed to prevent circumvention\").~      ~      ~        20~          See n. 7, supra; see generally Federal Election Commission, Campaign Guide for Congressional Candidates and Committees 10 (1999).~      ~      ~        21~          Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, post, at 14, we are not closing our eyes to District Court findings rejecting this record evidence. After alluding to the evidence cited above, 41 F. Supp. 2d 1197, 1203-1204 (Colo. 1999), and concluding that it did not support theories of corruption that we do not address here, see id., at 1211; n. 18, supra, the District Court mistakenly concluded that Colorado I had rejected the anticircumvention rationale as a matter of law, 41 F. Supp. 2d, at 1211, n. 9. We explain below, infra, at 28-30, why Colorado I's rejection of the anticircumvention rationale in the context of limits applied to independent party expenditures does not control the outcome of this case.~      ~      ~        22~          The dissent dismisses this evidence as describing \"legal\" practices. Post, at 15-16. The dissent may be correct that the FEC considers tallying legal, see Reply Brief for Petitioner 9, n. 3, but one thing is clear: tallying is a sign that contribution limits are being diluted and could be diluted further if the floodgates were open. Why, after all, does a party bother to tally? The obvious answer is that it wants to know who gets the benefit of the contributions to the party, as the record quotations attest. See also n. 23, infra. And the fact that the parties may not fund sure losers, stressed by the dissent (post, at 15), is irrelevant. The issue is what would become of contribution limits if parties could use unlimited coordinated spending to funnel contributions to those serious contenders who are favored by the donors.~      ~      ~        23~          Any such dollar-for-dollar pass-through would presumably be too obvious to escape the special provision on earmarking, 2 U.S.C.  441a(a)(8), see infra, at 27. But the example illustrates the undeniable inducement to more subtle circumvention.     The same enhanced value of coordinated spending that could be expected to promote greater circumvention of contribution limits for the benefit of the candidate-fundraiser would probably enhance the power of the fundraiser to use circumvention as a tactic to increase personal power and a claim to party leadership. The affluent nominee can already do this to a limited extent, by directing donations to the party and making sure that the party knows who raised the money, and that the needier candidates who receive the benefit of party spending know whom to thank. The candidate can thus become a player beyond his own race, and the donor's influence is multiplied. See generally App. 249 (Hickmott declaration) (\"Incumbents who were not raising money for themselves because they were not up for reelection would sometimes raise money for other Senators, or for challengers. They would send $20,000 to the DSCC and ask that this be entered on another candidate's tally. They might do this, for example, if they were planning to run for a leadership position and wanted to obtain the support of the Senators they assisted\"). If the effectiveness of party spending could be enhanced by limitless coordination, the ties of straitened candidates to prosperous ones and, vicariously, to large donors would be reinforced as well. Party officials who control distribution of coordinated expenditures would obviously form an additional link in this chain. See id., at 164, 168 (Billings declaration) (\"[The DSCC's three-member Executive Committee] basically made the decisions as to how to distribute the money.   Taking away the limits on coordinated expenditures would result in a fundamental transferal of power to certain individual Senators\").~      ~      ~        24~          In 1996, 46 percent of itemized (over $200) individual contributions to the Democratic national party committees and 15 percent of such contributions to the Republican national party committees were $10,000 or more. Biersack  Haskell, Spitting on the Umpire: Political Parties, the Federal Election Campaign Act, and the 1996 Campaigns, in Financing the 1996 Election 155, 160 (J. Green ed. 1999).~      ~      ~        25~          For example, the DSCC has established exclusive clubs for the most generous donors, who are invited to special meetings and social events with Senators and candidates. App. 254-255 (Hickmott declaration).~      ~      ~        26~          The Party's argument for relying on better earmarking enforcement, accepted by the dissent, post, at 18, would invite a corresponding attack on all contribution limits. As we said in Buckley, 424 U.S., at 27-28, and Shrink Missouri, 528 U.S., at 390, the policy supporting contribution limits is the same as for laws against bribery. But we do not throw out the contribution limits for unskillful tailoring; prohibitions on bribery, like the earmarking provision here, address only the \"most blatant and specific\" attempts at corruption, id., at 28.~      ~      ~        27~          The dissent therefore suggests, post, at 19, and the District Court mistakenly concluded, see discussion n. 21, supra, that Colorado I disposed of the tailoring question for purposes of this case.~      ~      ~        28~          The dissent notes a superficial tension between this analysis and our recent statement in Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U.S. ___ (2001), that \"it would be quite remarkable to hold that speech by a law-abiding [entity] can be suppressed in order to deter conduct by a non-law-abiding third party,\" id., at ___ (slip op., at 14). Unlike Bartnicki, there is no clear dichotomy here between law abider and lawbreaker. The problem of circumvention is a systemic one, accomplished only through complicity between donor and party.~      ~      ~        29~          Also, again, contrast Bartnicki, where the gulf between the First Amendment implications of two enforcement options was clear. We rejected the decision to penalize disclosure of lawfully obtained information of public interest instead of vigorously enforcing prohibitions on intercepting private conversations. Ibid.~      ~    ~    ~      44~      Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy join, and with whom The Chief Justice joins as to Part II, dissenting.~    ~    ~      45~      The Party Expenditure Provision, 2 U.S.C.  441a(d)(3), severely limits the amount of money that a national or state committee of a political party can spend in coordination with its own candidate for the Senate or House of Representatives. See, ante, at 3, and n. 3. Because this provision sweeps too broadly, interferes with the party-candidate relationship, and has not been proved necessary to combat corruption, I respectfully dissent.~    ~    ~      46~      * As an initial matter, I continue to believe that Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976) (per curiam), should be overruled. See Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U.S. 377, 410 (2000) (Thomas, J., dissenting); Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal Election Comm'n, 518 U.S. 604, 631 (1996) (Colorado I) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in part). \"Political speech is the primary object of First Amendment protection,\" Shrink Missouri, supra, at 410-411 (Thomas, J., dissenting); see also Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U.S. 214, 223 (1989); Mills v. Alabama, 384 U.S. 214, 218 (1966), and it is the lifeblood of a self-governing people, see Shrink Missouri, supra, at 405 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (\"[P]olitical speech in the course of elections [is] the speech upon which democracy depends\"). I remain baffled that this Court has extended the most generous First Amendment safeguards to filing lawsuits, wearing profane jackets, and exhibiting drive-in movies with nudity,1 but has offered only tepid protection to the core speech and associational rights that our Founders sought to defend.~    ~    ~      47~      In this case, the Government does not attempt to argue that the Party Expenditure Provision satisfies strict scrutiny, see Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983) (providing that, under strict scrutiny, a restriction on speech is constitutional only if it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest). Nor could it. For the reasons explained in my separate opinions in Colorado I, supra, at 641-644, and Shrink Missouri, supra, at 427-430, the campaign financing law at issue fails strict scrutiny.~    ~    II~    ~      48~      We need not, however, overrule Buckley and apply strict scrutiny in order to hold the Party Expenditure Provision unconstitutional. Even under Buckley, which described the requisite scrutiny as \"exacting\" and \"rigorous,\" 424 U.S., at 16, 29, the regulation cannot pass constitutional muster. In practice, Buckley scrutiny has meant that restrictions on contributions by individuals and political committees do not violate the First Amendment so long as they are \"closely drawn\" to match a \"sufficiently important\" government interest, Shrink Missouri, supra, at 387-389; see also Buckley, supra, at 58, but that restrictions on independent expenditures are constitutionally invalid, see Buckley, supra, at 58-59; see also Federal Election Comm'n v. National Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U.S. 480, 501 (1985). The rationale for this distinction between contributions and independent expenditures has been that, whereas ceilings on contributions by individuals and political committees \"entai[l] only a marginal restriction\" on First Amendment interests, Buckley, 424 U.S., at 20, limitations on independent expenditures \"impose significantly more severe restrictions on protected freedoms of political expression and association.\" Id., at 23.~    ~    ~      49~      * The Court notes this existing rationale and attempts simply to treat coordinated expenditures by political parties as equivalent to contributions by individuals and political committees. Thus, at least implicitly, the Court draws two conclusions: coordinated expenditures are no different from contributions, and political parties are no different from individuals and political committees. Both conclusions are flawed.~    ~    ~      50~      * The Court considers a coordinated expenditure to be an \" 'expenditur[e] made by any person in cooperation, consultation, or concert, with, or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, his authorized political committees, or their agents.' \" Ante, at 2 (quoting 2 U.S.C.  441a(a)(7)(B)(i)). This definition covers a broad array of conduct, some of which is akin to an independent expenditure. At one extreme, to be sure, are outlays that are \"virtually indistinguishable from simple contributions.\" Colorado I, 518 U.S., at 624 (opinion of Breyer, J.). An example would be \"a donation of money with direct payment of a candidate's media bills.\" Ibid. But toward the other end of the spectrum are expenditures that largely resemble, and should be entitled to the same protection as, independent expenditures. Take, for example, a situation in which the party develops a television advertising campaign touting a candidate's record on education, and the party simply \"consult[s],\" 2 U.S.C.  441a(a)(7)(B)(i), with the candidate on which time slot the advertisement should run for maximum effectiveness. I see no constitutional difference between this expenditure and a purely independent one. In the language of Buckley, the advertising campaign is not a mere \"general expression of support for the candidate and his views,\" but a communication of \"the underlying basis for the support.\" 424 U.S., at 21. It is not just \"symbolic expression,\" ibid., but a clear manifestation of the party's most fundamental political views. By restricting such speech, the Party Expenditure Provision undermines parties' \"freedom to discuss candidates and issues,\" ibid., and cannot be reconciled with our campaign finance jurisprudence.~    ~    2~    ~      51~      Even if I were to ignore the breadth of the statutory text, and to assume that all coordinated expenditures are functionally equivalent to contributions,2 I still would strike down the Party Expenditure Provision. The source of the \"contribution\" at issue is a political party, not an individual or a political committee, as in Buckley and Shrink Missouri. Restricting contributions by individuals and political committees may, under Buckley, entail only a \"marginal restriction,\" Buckley, supra, at 20, but the same cannot be said about limitations on political parties.~    ~    ~      52~      Political parties and their candidates are \"inextricably intertwined\" in the conduct of an election. Colorado I, supra, at 630 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in part). A party nominates its candidate; a candidate often is identified by party affiliation throughout the election and on the ballot; and a party's public image is largely defined by what its candidates say and do. See, e.g., California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567, 575 (2000) (\"Some political parties such as President Theodore Roosevelt's Bull Moose Party, the La Follette Progressives of 1924, the Henry Wallace Progressives of 1948, and the George Wallace American Independent Party of 1968 are virtually inseparable from their nominees (and tend not to outlast them\"); see also M. Zak, Back to Basics for the Republican Party 1 (2000) (noting that the Republican Party has been identified as the \"Party of Lincoln\"). Most importantly, a party's success or failure depends in large part on whether its candidates get elected. Because of this unity of interest, it is natural for a party and its candidate to work together and consult with one another during the course of the election. See, e.g., App. 137 (declaration of Herbert E. Alexander, Director of the Citizens' Research Foundation at the University of Southern California). Indeed, \"it would be impractical and imprudent   for a party to support its own candidates without some form of 'cooperation' or 'consultation.' \" See Colorado I, 518 U.S., at 630 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in part). \"[C]andidates are necessary to make the party's message known and effective, and vice versa.\" Id., at 629. Thus, the ordinary means for a party to provide support is to make coordinated expenditures, see, e.g., App. 137-138 (declaration of Herbert E. Alexander), as the Government itself maintained just five years ago, see Brief for Respondent in Colorado I, O. T. 1995, No. 95-489, p. 27 (contending that Congress had made an \"empirical judgment that party officials will as a matter of course consult with the party's candidates before funding communications intended to influence the outcome of a federal election\"); see also FEC Advisory Opinion 1985-14, CCH Fed. Election Camp. Fin. Guide 5819, p. 11,186, n. 4 (1985) (\"Party political committees are incapable of making independent expenditures\").~    ~    ~      53~      As the District Court explained, to break this link between the party and its candidates would impose \"additional costs and burdens to promote the party message.\" 41 F. Supp. 2d 1197, 1210 (Colo. 1999). This observation finds full support in the record. See, e.g., App. 218 (statement of Anthony Corrado, Associate Professor of Government, Colby College) (explaining that, to ensure that expenditures were independent, party organizations had to establish legally separate entities, which in turn had to \"rent and furnish an office, hire staff, and pay other administrative costs,\" as well as \"engage additional consulting services\" and \"duplicate many of the functions already being undertaken by other party offices\"); id., at 52 (statement by Federal Election Commission admitting that national party established separate entities that made independent expenditures); id., at 217 (statement of Anthony Corrado) (explaining that reliance on independent expenditures would increase fundraising demands on party organizations because independent expenditures are less effective means of communication); id., at 219 (\"[I]ndependent expenditures do not qualify for the lowest unit rates on the purchase of broadcasting time\"); App. in No. 99-1211 (CA10), p. 512 (report of Frank J. Sorauf, professor at University of Minnesota, and Jonathan S. Krasno, professor at Princeton University) (noting inefficiency of independent expenditures). Establishing and maintaining independence also tends to create voter confusion and to undermine the candidate that the party sought to support. App. 220 (statement of Anthony Corrado); App. in No. 99-1211 (CA10), at 623-624 (deposition of John Heubusch); App. 159 (affidavit of Donald K. Bain) (\"[O]ur communications can be more focused, understandable, and effective if the Party and its candidates can work together\"). Finally, because of the ambiguity in the term \"coordinated expenditure,\" the Party Expenditure Provision chills permissible speech as well. See, e.g., id., at 159-160 (affidavit of Donald K. Bain). Thus, far from being a mere \"marginal\" restraint on speech, Buckley, 424 U.S., at 20, the Party Expenditure Provision has restricted the party's most natural form of communication; has precluded parties \"from effectively amplifying the voice of their adherents,\" id., at 22; and has had a \"stifling effect on the ability of the party to do what it exists to do.\"3 Colorado I, 518 U.S., at 630 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in part).~    ~    ~      54~      The Court nevertheless concludes that these concerns of inhibiting party speech are rendered \"implausible\" by the nearly 30 years of history in which coordinated spending has been statutorily limited. Ante, at 14. Without a single citation to the record, the Court rejects the assertion \"that for almost three decades political parties have not been functional or have been functioning in systematic violation of the law.\" Ibid. I am unpersuaded by the Court's attempts to downplay the extent of the burden on political parties' First Amendment rights. First, the Court does not examine the record or the findings of the District Court, but instead relies wholly on the \"observ[ations]\" of the \"political scientists\" who happen to have written an amicus brief in support of the petitioner. Ibid. I find more convincing, and more relevant, the record evidence that the parties have developed, which, as noted above, indicates that parties have suffered as a result of the Party Expenditure Provision.4 See, supra, at 6-7. Second, we have never before upheld a limitation on speech simply because speakers have coped with the limitation for 30 years. See, e.g., Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U.S. ___, ___ (2001) (slip op., at 1-2) (holding unconstitutional under the First Amendment restrictions on the disclosure of the contents of an illegally intercepted communication, even though federal law had prohibited such disclosure for 67 years). And finally, if the passage of time were relevant to the constitutional inquiry, I would wonder why the Court adopted a \"30-year\" rule rather than the possible countervailing \"200-year\" rule. For nearly 200 years, this country had congressional elections without limitations on coordinated expenditures by political parties. Nowhere does the Court suggest that these elections were not \"functional,\" ante, at 14, or that they were marred by corruption.~    ~    ~      55~      The Court's only other response to the argument that parties are linked to candidates and that breaking this link would impose significant costs on speech is no response at all. The Court contends that parties are not organized simply to \"elec[t] particular candidates\" as evidenced by the fact that many political action committees donate money to both parties and sometimes even opposing candidates. Ante, at 15. According to the Court, \"[p]arties are thus necessarily the instruments of some contributors whose object is not to support the party's message or to elect party candidates across the board.\" Id., at 16-17. There are two flaws in the Court's analysis. First, no one argues that a party's role is merely to get particular candidates elected. Surely, among other reasons, parties also exist to develop and promote a platform. See, e.g., Brief for Respondent 23. The point is simply that parties and candidates have shared interests, that it is natural for them to work together, and that breaking the connection between parties and their candidates inhibits the promotion of the party's message. Second, the mere fact that some donors contribute to both parties and their candidates does not necessarily imply that the donors control the parties or their candidates. It certainly does not mean that the parties are mere \"instruments\" or \"agents,\" ante, at 17, of the donors. Indeed, if a party receives money from donors on both sides of an issue, how can it be a tool of both donors? If the Green Party were to receive a donation from an industry that pollutes, would the Green Party necessarily become, through no choice of its own, an instrument of the polluters? The Court proffers no evidence that parties have become pawns of wealthy contributors. Parties might be the target of the speech of donors, but that does not suggest that parties are influenced (let alone improperly influenced) by the speech. Thus, the Court offers no explanation for why political parties should be treated the same as individuals and political committees.~    ~    B~    ~      56~      But even if I were to view parties' coordinated expenditures as akin to contributions by individuals and political committees, I still would hold the Party Expenditure Provision constitutionally invalid. Under Shrink Missouri, a contribution limit is constitutional only if the Government demonstrates that the regulation is \"closely drawn\" to match a \"sufficiently important interest.\" 528 U.S., at 387-388 (quoting Buckley, supra, at 25) (internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, there is no question that the Government has asserted a sufficient interest, that of preventing corruption. See Shrink Missouri, supra, at 388 (\" '[T]he prevention of corruption and the appearance of corruption' was found to be a 'constitutionally sufficient justification' \") (quoting Buckley, supra, at 25-26). The question is whether the Government has demonstrated both that coordinated expenditures by parties give rise to corruption and that the restriction is \"closely drawn\" to curb this corruption. I believe it has not.~    ~    ~      57~      * As this Court made clear just last Term, \"[w]e have never accepted mere conjecture as adequate to carry a First Amendment burden.\" Shrink Missouri, 528 U.S., at 392. Some \"quantum of empirical evidence [is] needed to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny of legislative judgments.\" Id., at 391. Precisely how much evidence is required will \"vary up or down with the novelty and plausibility of the justification raised.\" Ibid. Today, the Court has jettisoned this evidentiary requirement.~    ~    ~      58~      Considering that we have never upheld an expenditure limitation against political parties, I would posit that substantial evidence is necessary to justify the infringement of parties' First Amendment interests. But we need not accept this high evidentiary standard to strike down the Party Expenditure Provision for want of evidence. Under the least demanding evidentiary requirement, the Government has failed to carry its burden, for it has presented no evidence at all of corruption or the perception of corruption. The Government does not, and indeed cannot, point to any congressional findings suggesting that the Party Expenditure Provision is necessary, or even helpful, in reducing corruption or the perception of corruption. In fact, this Court has recognized that \"Congress wrote the Party Expenditure Provision not so much because of a special concern about the potentially 'corrupting' effect of party expenditures, but rather for the constitutionally insufficient purpose of reducing what it saw as wasteful and excessive campaign spending.\"5 Colorado I, 518 U.S., at 618. See also ibid. (\"[R]ather than indicating a special fear of the corruptive influence of political parties, the legislative history demonstrates Congress' general desire to enhance what was seen as an important and legitimate role for political parties in American elections\").~    ~    ~      59~      Without explanation, the Court departs from this earlier, well-considered understanding of the Party Expenditure Provision. Were there any evidence of corruption in the record that the parties have since developed, such a departure might be justified. But as the District Court found, \"[t]he facts which [the] FEC contends support its position   do not establish that the limit on party coordinated expenditures is necessary to prevent corruption or the appearance thereof.\" 41 F. Supp. 2d, at 1211. Indeed, \"[n]one of the FEC's examples [of alleged corruption] involve[s] coordinated expenditures.\" Ibid. See also App. in No. 99-1211 (CA10), at 346 (declaration of Herbert E. Alexander) (\"In the decades since 1974, when coordinated expenditures were allowed for both presidential and congressional campaigns, there has not been any dispute relating to them, no charges of corruption or the appearance thereof  \"); id., at 430 (statement of Anthony Corrado) (\"There is no academic analysis or scholarly study conducted to date that demonstrates that parties are corrupted by the federally regulated contributions, the so-called 'hard-money funds,' they receive from donors. None of the studies of party finance or party coordinated spending contend[s] that these funds are corruptive or generate the appearance of corruption in the political process\"); id., at 624 (deposition of John Heubusch) (testifying that, in his experience, political party spending was not a source of corruption of Members of the United States Senate).6~    ~    ~      60~      The dearth of evidence is unsurprising in light of the unique relationship between a political party and its candidates: \"The very aim of a political party is to influence its candidate's stance on issues and, if the candidate takes office or is reelected, his votes.\" Colorado I, 518 U.S., at 646 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in part). If coordinated expenditures help achieve this aim, the achievement \"does not   constitute 'a subversion of the political process.' \" Ibid. (quoting Federal Election Comm'n, 470 U.S., at 497). It is simply the essence of our Nation's party system of government. One can speak of an individual citizen or a political action committee corrupting or coercing a candidate, but \"[w]hat could it mean for a party to 'corrupt' its candidate or to exercise 'coercive' influence over him?\" 470 U. S, at 646.~    ~    ~      61~      Apparently unable to provide an answer to this question, the Court relies upon an alternative theory of corruption. According to the Court, the Party Expenditure Provision helps combat circumvention of the limits on individual donors' contributions, which limits are necessary to reduce corruption by those donors.7 See ante, at 17-20. The primary problem with this contention, however, is that it too is plainly contradicted by the findings of the District Court, see 41 F. Supp. 2d, at 1211, and the overwhelming evidence in the record, see, supra, at 11.8 And this contention is particularly surprising in light of Colorado I, in which we discussed the same opportunity for corruption through circumvention, and, far from finding it dispositive, concluded that any opportunity for corruption was \"at best, attenuated.\" 518 U.S., at 616.~    ~    ~      62~      Without addressing the District Court's determination or reflecting on this Court's understanding in Colorado I, the Court today asserts that its newfound position is supported by \"substantial evidence.\" The best evidence the Court can come up with, however, is the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's (DSCC) use of the \"tally system,\" which \"connect[s] donors to candidates through the accommodation of a party.\" Ante, at 24. The tally system is not evidence of corruption-by-circumvention. In actuality, the DSCC is not acting as a mere conduit, allowing donors to contribute money in excess of the legal limits. The DSCC instead has allocated money based on a number of factors, including \"the financial strength of the campaign,\" \"what [the candidate's] poll numbers looked like,\" and \"who had the best chance of winning or who needed the money most.\" App. 250-251 (declaration of Robert Hickmott, former Democratic fundraiser and National Finance Director for Timothy Wirth's Senate campaign); see also App. in No. 99-1211 (CA10), at 430 (statement of Anthony Corrado) (\"When parties are deciding whether to spend funds on behalf of a candidate, they chiefly examine the competitiveness of the district or race, the political situation of the incumbent, and the strength of the party contender's candidacy\"); id., at 563 (deposition of Donald Bain) (stating that the party generally did not support someone who has a safe seat or is clearly not going to win). As the District Court found, \"the primary consideration in allocating funds is which races are marginal that is which races are ones where party money could be the difference between winning and losing.\" 41 F. Supp. 2d, at 1203. \"Maintaining party control over seats is paramount to the parties' pursuits.\" Ibid.; see also App. in No. 99-1211 (CA10), at 483 (stating that primary goal of legislative campaign committees is \"to win or maintain control of the chamber and the powers of the majority legislative party\"). The \"bottom line\" of the tally system is that \"some candidates get back more money than they raise, and others get back less.\" App. 250 (declaration of Robert Hickmott).~    ~    ~      63~      Moreover, the Court does not explain how the tally system could constitute evidence of corruption. Both the initial contribution to the party and the subsequent expenditure by the party on the candidate are currently legal. In essence, the Court is asserting that it is corrupt for parties to do what is legal to enhance their participation in the political process. Each step in the process is permitted, but the combination of those steps, the Court apparently believes, amounts to corruption sufficient to silence those who wish to support a candidate. In my view, the First Amendment demands a more coherent explication of the evidence of corruption.9~    ~    ~      64~      Finally, even if the tally system were evidence of corruption-through-circumvention, it is only evidence of what is occurring under the current system, not of additional \"corruption\" that would arise in the absence of the Party Expenditure Provision. The Court speculates that, if we invalidated the Party Expenditure Provision, \"the inducement to circumvent would almost certainly intensify.\" Ante, at 25. But that is nothing more than supposition, which is insufficient under our precedents to sustain a restriction on First Amendment interests. See Shrink Missouri, 528 U.S., at 392 (\"We have never accepted mere conjecture as adequate to carry a First Amendment burden\"). See also United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 822 (2000) (concluding that the government \"must present more than anecdote and supposition\"). And it is weak supposition at that. The Court does not contend that the DSCC's alleged efforts to channel money through the tally system were restricted in any way by the Party Expenditure Provision. On the contrary, the Court suggests that a donation to the DSCC was increased by the party; in other words, the candidate got more than the initial donation. See ante, at 23 (quoting declaration of Timothy Wirth) (\" 'I understood that when I raised funds for the DSCC, the donors expected that I would receive the amount of their donations multiplied by a certain number that the DSCC had determined in advance, assuming the DSCC has raised other funds' \" (emphasis added)). Because I am unpersuaded by weak speculation ungrounded in any evidence, I disagree with the Court's conclusion that the Party Expenditure Provision furthers the Government interest of reducing corruption.10~    ~    2~    ~      65~      Even if the Government had presented evidence that the Party Expenditure Provision affects corruption, the statute still would be unconstitutional, because there are better tailored alternatives for addressing the corruption. In addition to bribery laws and disclosure laws, see Shrink Missouri, supra, at 428 (Thomas, J., dissenting), the Government has two options that would not entail the restriction of political parties' First Amendment rights.~    ~    ~      66~      First, the Government could enforce the earmarking rule of 2 U.S.C.  441a(a)(8), under which contributions that \"are in any way earmarked or otherwise directed through an intermediary or conduit to [a] candidate\" are treated as contributions to the candidate. Vigilant enforcement of this provision is a precise response to the Court's circumvention concerns. If a donor contributes $2,000 to a candidate (the maximum donation in an election cycle), he cannot direct the political party to funnel another dime to the candidate without confronting the Federal Election Campaign Act's civil and criminal penalties, see 2 U.S.C.  437g(a)(6)(C) (civil); 437g(d) (criminal).~    ~    ~      67~      According to the Court, reliance on this earmarking provision \"ignores the practical difficulty of identifying and directly combating circumvention\" and \"would reach only the most clumsy attempts to pass contributions through to candidates.\" Ante, at 27, 28. The Court, however, does not cite any evidence to support this assertion. Nor does it articulate what failed steps the Government already has taken. Nor does it explain why the burden that the Government allegedly would have to bear in uncovering circumvention justifies the infringement of political parties' First Amendment rights. In previous cases, we have not been so willing to overlook such failures. See, e.g., Bartnicki 532 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 15-16) (\"[T]here is no empirical evidence to support the assumption that the prohibition against disclosures reduces the number of illegal interceptions\").~    ~    ~      68~      In any event, there is a second, well-tailored option for combating corruption that does not entail the reduction of parties' First Amendment freedoms. The heart of the Court's circumvention argument is that, whereas individuals can donate only $2,000 to a candidate in a given election cycle, they can donate $20,000 to the national committees of a political party, an amount that is allegedly large enough to corrupt the candidate. See ante, at 18. If indeed $20,000 is enough to corrupt a candidate (an assumption that seems implausible on its face and is, in any event, unsupported by any evidence), the proper response is to lower the cap. That way, the speech restriction is directed at the source of the alleged corruption the individual donor and not the party. \"The normal method of deterring unlawful conduct is to impose an appropriate punishment on the person who engages in it.\" Bartnicki, 532 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 14). \"[I]t would be quite remarkable to hold that speech by a law-abiding [entity] can be suppressed in order to deter conduct by a non-law-abiding third party.\" Ibid. The Court takes that unorthodox path today, a decision that is all the more remarkable considering that the controlling opinion in Colorado I expressly rejected it just five years ago. 518 U.S., at 617 (\"We could understand how Congress, were it to conclude that the potential for evasion of the individual limits was a serious matter, might decide to change the statute's limitations on contributions to political parties. But we do not believe that the risk of corruption present here could justify the 'markedly greater burden on basic freedoms caused by' the statute's limitations on expenditures\" (citations omitted)).~    ~    ~      69~      In my view, it makes no sense to contravene a political party's core First Amendment rights because of what a third party might unlawfully try to do. Instead of broadly restricting political parties' speech, the Government should have pursued better-tailored alternatives for combating the alleged corruption.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~          NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 444 (1963); Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15, 26 (1971); Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 208-215 (1975).~      ~      ~        2~              The Court makes this very assumption. See ante, at 29 (\"There is no significant functional difference between a party's coordinated expenditure and a direct party contribution to the candidate\"). To the extent the Court has not defined the universe of coordinated expenditures and leaves open the possibility that there are such expenditures that would not be functionally identical to direct contributions, the constitutionality of the Party Expenditure Provision as applied to such expenditures remains unresolved. See, e. g., ante, at 21, n. 17. At oral argument, the Government appeared to suggest that the Party Expenditure Provision might not reach expenditures that are not functionally identical to contributions. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 15 (stating that the purpose of the Party Expenditure Provision is simply to prevent someone \"from making contributions in the form of paying the candidate's bills\").~      ~      ~        3~          The Court contends that, notwithstanding this burden, \"it is nonetheless possible for parties, like individuals and nonparty groups, to speak independently.\" Ante, at 15, n. 11 (emphasis added). That is correct, but it does not render the restriction constitutional. If Congress were to pass a law imposing a $1,000 tax on every political newspaper editorial, the law would surely constitute an unconstitutional restraint on speech, even though it would still be possible for newspapers to print such editorials. The Court's holding presents an additional First Amendment problem. Because of the close relationship between parties and candidates, lower courts will face a difficult, if not insurmountable, task in trying to determine whether particular party expenditures are in fact coordinated or independent. As the American Civil Liberties Union points out, \"[e]ven if such an inquiry is feasible, it inevitably would involve an intrusive and constitutionally troubling investigation of the inner workings of political parties.\" Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as Amici Curiae 18.~      ~      ~        4~          Moreover, were I to depart from the record, as does the Court, I could consider sources suggesting that parties in fact have lost power in recent years. See, e.g., M. Wattenberg, The Decline of American Political Parties, 1952-1996, p. 174 (1998) (indicating that percentage of voters who identify with a party has declined while percentage of split tickets has increased); Maisel, American Political Parties: Still Central to a Functioning Democracy?, in American Political Parties: Decline or Resurgence?, 103, 107-111 (J. Cohen, R. Fleisher,  P. Kantor eds. 2001) (describing weaknesses of modern political parties). I also could explore how political parties have coped with the restrictions on coordinated expenditures. As Justice Kennedy has explained, \"[t]he Court has forced a substantial amount of political speech underground, as contributors and candidates devise ever more elaborate methods of avoiding contribution limits.\" Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U.S. 377, 406 (2000) (dissenting opinion). Perhaps political parties have survived, not because the regulation at issue imposes less than a substantial burden on speech, but simply because the parties have found \"underground\" alternatives for communication.~      ~      ~        5~          The Court contends that I \"ignor[e] [a] distinction,\" ante, at 23, n.19: Whereas Congress may not have been concerned with corruption insofar as independent expenditures were implicated, Congress was concerned with corruption insofar as coordinated expenditures were implicated. This \"distinction\" must have been lost on Congress as well, which made no finding that the Party Expenditure Provision serves different purposes for different expenditures. It also was lost on the Court in Colorado I, which stated in no uncertain terms that Congress was not motivated by \"the potentially 'corrupting' effect of party expenditures.\" Colorado I, 518 U.S., at 618.~      ~      ~        6~          In Missouri Republican Party v. Lamb, 227 F.3d 1070 (2000), the Eighth Circuit held that the State of Missouri's restrictions on contributions by political parties violated the First Amendment. In accord with the Tenth Circuit in this case, the Eighth Circuit concluded that \"the record is wholly devoid of any evidence that limiting parties' campaign contributions will either reduce corruption or measurably decrease the number of occasions on which limitations on individuals' campaign contributions are circumvented.\" Id., at 1073.~      ~      ~        7~          The Court does not argue that the Party Expenditure Provision is necessary to reduce the perception of corruption. Nor could the record sustain such an argument. See 41 F. Supp. 2d 1197, 1211 (Colo. 1999).~      ~      ~        8~          Contrary to the Court's suggestion, ante, at 24, n. 21, the District Court did not simply conclude that \"Colorado I had rejected the anti-circumvention rationale as a matter of law.\" Instead, the District Court first concluded there was no evidence of corruption, 41 F. Supp. 2d, at 1211. Only after the District Court made this factual finding did it, in a footnote, cite Colorado I to support the legal conclusion. See 41 F. Supp. 2d, at 1211, n. 9 (\"Moreover, if the skirting of contribution limits is the issue with which the FEC is concerned   there are more tailored means of addressing such a concern than limiting the coordinated expenditure limits\" (citing Colorado I)).~      ~      ~        9~          Ironically, earlier this Term, this Court was less willing to uphold a speech restriction based on inference of circumvention. See, e.g., Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U.S. ___, ___ (2001) (slip op., at 14-20) (holding unconstitutional the prohibition on disclosure of illegally intercepted conversation even though the initial step in the disclosure process, the interception, was illegal and harmful to those whose privacy was invaded).~      ~      ~        10~          The other \"evidence\" on which the Court relies is less compelling than the tally system. The Court presents four quotations, two of which do not even support the proposition that donations are funneled through parties to candidates. See ante, at 23 (quoting declaration of Leon G. Billings, former Executive Director of the DSCC); ante, at 24. These comments simply reflect the obvious fact that a candidate benefits when his party receives money. Neither comment suggests that the candidate is aided through the surreptitious laundering of money, as opposed to issue advertisements, get-out-the-vote campaigns, and independent expenditures. The other two quotations are somewhat suspect in that they are made by Timothy Wirth, who was the object of the negative advertisements giving rise to this lawsuit, and by his national finance director. See ante, at 23 (quoting App. 274 (declaration of Timothy Wirth)); App. 247 (declaration of Robert Hickmott, former Democratic fundraiser and National Finance Director for Timothy Wirth's Senate campaign). Moreover, neither Wirth nor his finance director described how donations were actually treated by the DSCC, either in general or in Wirth's particular case; instead Wirth and his finance director simply reflected on their understandings of how the money would be used in Wirth's election. As noted above, the District Court found that \"the primary consideration in allocating funds is which races are marginal.\" 41 F. Supp. 2d, at 1203. And the evidence in the record supports this finding. See supra, at 13.~      ~    ~    ",

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.NEW  YORK  TIMES  COMPANY,  INC.,   et al., PETITIONERSv.JONATHAN TASINI et al.~    No. 00-201~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    June 25, 2001Argued March 28, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      Respondent freelance authors (Authors) wrote articles (Articles) for newspapers and a magazine published by petitioners New York Times Company (Times), Newsday, Inc. (Newsday), and Time, Inc. (Time). The Times, Newsday, and Time (Print Publishers) engaged the Authors as independent contractors under contracts that in no instance secured an Author's consent to placement of an Article in an electronic database. The Print Publishers each licensed rights to copy and sell articles to petitioner LEXIS/NEXIS, owner and operator of NEXIS. NEXIS is a computerized database containing articles in text-only format from hundreds of periodicals spanning many years. Subscribers access NEXIS through a computer, may search for articles using criteria such as author and subject, and may view, print, or download each article yielded by the search. An article's display identifies its original print publication, date, section, initial page number, title, and author, but each article appears in isolation without visible link to other stories originally published in the same periodical edition. NEXIS does not reproduce the print publication's formatting features such as headline size and page placement. The Times also has licensing agreements with petitioner University Microfilms International (UMI), authorizing reproduction of Times materials on two CD-ROM products. One, the New York Times OnDisc (NYTO), is a text-only database containing Times articles presented in essentially the same way they appear in LEXIS/NEXIS. The other, General Periodicals OnDisc (GPO), is an image-based system that reproduces the Times' Sunday Book Review and Magazine exactly as they appeared on the printed pages, complete with photographs, captions, advertisements, and other surrounding materials. The two CD-ROM products are searchable in much the same way as LEXIS/NEXIS; in both, articles retrieved by users provide no links to other articles appearing in the original print publications.~      The Authors filed this suit, alleging that their copyrights were infringed when, as permitted and facilitated by the Print Publishers, LEXIS/NEXIS and UMI (Electronic Publishers) placed the Articles in NEXIS, NYTO, and GPO (Databases). The Authors sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and damages. In response to the Authors' complaint, the Print and Electronic Publishers raised the privilege accorded collective work copyright owners by 201(c) of the Copyright Act. That provision, pivotal in this case, reads: \"Copyright in each separate contribution to a collective work is distinct from copyright in the collective work as a whole, and vests initially in the author of the contribution. In the absence of an express transfer of the copyright or of any rights under it, the owner of copyright in the collective work is presumed to have acquired only the privilege of reproducing and distributing the contribution as part of that particular collective work, any revision of that collective work, and any later collective work in the same series.\" The District Court granted the Publishers summary judgment, holding, inter alia, that the Databases reproduced and distributed the Authors' works, in 201(c)'s words, \"as part of   [a] revision of that collective work\" to which the Authors had first contributed. The Second Circuit reversed, granting the Authors summary judgment on the ground that the Databases were not among the collective works covered by 201(c), and specifically, were not \"revisions\" of the periodicals in which the Articles first appeared.~      Held: Section 201(c) does not authorize the copying at issue here. The Publishers are not sheltered by 201(c) because the Databases reproduce and distribute articles standing alone and not in context, not \"as part of that particular collective work\" to which the author contributed, \"as part of   any revision\" thereof, or \"as part of   any later collective work in the same series.\" Pp. 8-21.~      (a) Where, as here, a freelance author has contributed an article to a collective work, copyright in the contribution vests initially in its author. 201(c). Copyright in the collective work vests in the collective author (here, the Print Publisher) and extends only to the creative material contributed by that author, not to \"the preexisting material employed in the work,\" 103(b). Congress enacted the provisions of the 1976 revision of the Copyright Act at issue to address the unfair situation under prior law, whereby authors risked losing their rights when they placed an article in a collective work. The 1976 Act recast the copyright as a bundle of discrete \"exclusive rights,\" 106, each of which \"may be transferred   and owned separately,\" 201(d)(2). The Act also provided, in 404(a), that \"a single notice applicable to the collective work as a whole is sufficient\" to protect the rights of freelance contributors. Together, 404(a) and 201(c) preserve the author's copyright in a contribution to a collective work. Under 201(c)'s terms, a publisher could reprint a contribution from one issue in a later issue of its magazine, and could reprint an article from one edition of an encyclopedia in a later revision of it, but could not revise the contribution itself or include it in a new anthology or an entirely different collective work. Essentially, 201(c) adjusts a publisher's copyright in its collective work to accommodate a freelancer's copyright in her contribution. If there is demand for a freelance article standing alone or in a new collection, the Copyright Act allows the freelancer to benefit from that demand; after authorizing initial publication, the freelancer may also sell the article to others. Cf. Stewart v. Abend, 495 U.S. 207, 229, 230. It would scarcely preserve the author's copyright in a contribution as contemplated by Congress if a print publisher, without the author's permission, could reproduce or distribute discrete copies of the contribution in isolation or within new collective works. Pp. 8-12.~      (b) The Publishers' view that inclusion of the Articles in the Databases lies within the \"privilege of reproducing and distributing the [Articles] as part of   [a] revision of that collective work,\" 201(c), is unacceptable. In determining whether the Articles have been reproduced and distributed \"as part of\" a \"revision,\" the Court focuses on the Articles as presented to, and perceptible by, a Database user. See 102, 101. Here, the three Databases present articles to users clear of the context provided either by the original periodical editions or by any revision of those editions. The Databases first prompt users to search the universe of their contents: thousands or millions of files containing individual articles from thousands of collective works (i.e., editions), either in one series (the Times, in NYTO) or in scores of series (the sundry titles in NEXIS and GPO). When the user conducts a search, each article appears as a separate item within the search result. In NEXIS and NYTO, an article appears to a user without the graphics, formatting, or other articles with which it was initially published. In GPO, the article appears with the other materials published on the same page or pages, but without any material published on other pages of the original periodical. In either circumstance, the Database does not reproduce and distribute the article \"as part of\" either the original edition or a \"revision\" of that edition. The articles may be viewed as parts of a new compendium namely, the entirety of works in the Database. Each edition of each periodical, however, represents only a miniscule fraction of the ever-expanding Database. The massive whole of the Database is not recognizable as a new version of its every small part. Furthermore, the Articles in the Databases may be viewed \"as part of\" no larger work at all, but simply as individual articles presented individually. That each article bears marks of its origin in a particular periodical suggests the article was previously part of that periodical, not that the article is currently reproduced or distributed as part of the periodical. The Databases' reproduction and distribution of individual Articles simply as individual Articles would invade the core of the Authors' exclusive rights. The Publishers' analogy between the Databases and microfilm and microfiche is wanting: In the Databases, unlike microfilm, articles appear disconnected from their original context. Unlike the conversion of newsprint to microfilm, the transfer of articles to the Databases does not represent a mere conversion of intact periodicals (or revisions of periodicals) from one medium to another. The Databases offer users individual articles, not intact periodicals. The concept of \"media-neutrality\" invoked by the Publishers should therefore protect the Authors' rights, not the Publishers'. The result is not changed because users can manipulate the Databases to generate search results consisting entirely of articles from a particular periodical edition. Under 201(c), the question is not whether a user can assemble a revision of a collective work from a database, but whether the database itself perceptibly presents the author's contribution as part of a revision of the collective work. That result is not accomplished by these Databases. Pp. 12-19.~      (c) The Publishers' warning that a ruling for the Authors will have \"devastating\" consequences, punching gaping holes in the electronic record of history, is unavailing. It hardly follows from this decision that an injunction against the inclusion of these Articles in the Databases (much less all freelance articles in any databases) must issue. The Authors and Publishers may enter into an agreement allowing continued electronic reproduction of the Authors' works; they, and if necessary the courts and Congress, may draw on numerous models for distributing copyrighted works and remunerating authors for their distribution. In any event, speculation about future harms is no basis for this Court to shrink authorial rights created by Congress. The Court leaves remedial issues open for initial airing and decision in the District Court. Pp. 19-21.206 F.3d 161, affirmed.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT~      Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, and Thomas, JJ., joined.~      Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      This copyright case concerns the rights of freelance authors and a presumptive privilege of their publishers. The litigation was initiated by six freelance authors and relates to articles they contributed to three print periodicals (two newspapers and one magazine). Under agreements with the periodicals' publishers, but without the freelancers' consent, two computer database companies placed copies of the freelancers' articles along with all other articles from the periodicals in which the freelancers' work appeared into three databases. Whether written by a freelancer or staff member, each article is presented to, and retrievable by, the user in isolation, clear of the context the original print publication presented.~    ~    ~      2~      The freelance authors' complaint alleged that their copyrights had been infringed by the inclusion of their articles in the databases. The publishers, in response, relied on the privilege of reproduction and distribution accorded them by 201(c) of the Copyright Act, which provides:~    ~    ~      3~      \"Copyright in each separate contribution to a collective work is distinct from copyright in the collective work as a whole, and vests initially in the author of the contribution. In the absence of an express transfer of the copyright or of any rights under it, the owner of copyright in the collective work is presumed to have acquired only the privilege of reproducing and distributing the contribution as part of that particular collective work, any revision of that collective work, and any later collective work in the same series.\" 17 U.S.C.  201(c).Specifically, the publishers maintained that, as copyright owners of collective works, i.e., the original print publications, they had merely exercised \"the privilege\" 201(c) accords them to \"reproduc[e] and distribut[e]\" the author's discretely copyrighted contribution.~    ~    ~      4~      In agreement with the Second Circuit, we hold that 201(c) does not authorize the copying at issue here. The publishers are not sheltered by 201(c), we conclude, because the databases reproduce and distribute articles standing alone and not in context, not \"as part of that particular collective work\" to which the author contributed, \"as part of   any revision\" thereof, or \"as part of   any later collective work in the same series.\" Both the print publishers and the electronic publishers, we rule, have infringed the copyrights of the freelance authors.~    ~    ~      5~      * A~    ~    ~      6~      Respondents Jonathan Tasini, Mary Kay Blakely, Barbara Garson, Margot Mifflin, Sonia Jaffe Robbins, and David S. Whitford are authors (Authors). Between 1990 and 1993, they wrote the 21 articles (Articles) on which this dispute centers. Tasini, Mifflin, and Blakely contributed 12 Articles to The New York Times, the daily newspaper published by petitioner The New York Times Company (Times). Tasini, Garson, Robbins, and Whitford wrote eight Articles for Newsday, another New York daily paper, published by petitioner Newsday, Inc. (Newsday). Whitford also contributed one Article to Sports Illustrated, a weekly magazine published by petitioner Time, Inc. (Time). The Authors registered copyrights in each of the Articles. The Times, Newsday, and Time (Print Publishers) registered collective work copyrights in each periodical edition in which an Article originally appeared. The Print Publishers engaged the Authors as independent contractors (freelancers) under contracts that in no instance secured consent from an Author to placement of an Article in an electronic database.1~    ~    ~      7~      At the time the Articles were published, all three Print Publishers had agreements with petitioner LEXIS/NEXIS (formerly Mead Data Central Corp.), owner and operator of NEXIS, a computerized database that stores information in a text-only format. NEXIS contains articles from hundreds of journals (newspapers and periodicals) spanning many years. The Print Publishers have licensed to LEXIS/NEXIS the text of articles appearing in the three periodicals. The licenses authorize LEXIS/NEXIS to copy and sell any portion of those texts.~    ~    ~      8~      Pursuant to the licensing agreements, the Print Publishers regularly provide LEXIS/NEXIS with a batch of all the articles published in each periodical edition. The Print Publisher codes each article to facilitate computerized retrieval, then transmits it in a separate file. After further coding, LEXIS/NEXIS places the article in the central discs of its database.~    ~    ~      9~      Subscribers to NEXIS, accessing the system through a computer, may search for articles by author, subject, date, publication, headline, key term, words in text, or other criteria. Responding to a search command, NEXIS scans the database and informs the user of the number of articles meeting the user's search criteria. The user then may view, print, or download each of the articles yielded by the search. The display of each article includes the print publication (e.g., The New York Times), date (September 23, 1990), section (Magazine), initial page number (26), headline or title (\"Remembering Jane\"), and author (Mary Kay Blakely). Each article appears as a separate, isolated \"story\" without any visible link to the other stories originally published in the same newspaper or magazine edition. NEXIS does not contain pictures or advertisements, and it does not reproduce the original print publication's formatting features such as headline size, page placement (e.g., above or below the fold for newspapers), or location of continuation pages.~    ~    ~      10~      The Times (but not Newsday or Time) also has licensing agreements with petitioner University Microfilms International (UMI). The agreements authorize reproduction of Times materials on two CD-ROM products, the New York Times OnDisc (NYTO) and General Periodicals OnDisc (GPO).~    ~    ~      11~      Like NEXIS, NYTO is a text-only system. Unlike NEXIS, NYTO, as its name suggests, contains only the Times. Pursuant to a three-way agreement, LEXIS/NEXIS provides UMI with computer files containing each article as transmitted by the Times to LEXIS/NEXIS. Like LEXIS/NEXIS, UMI marks each article with special codes. UMI also provides an index of all the articles in NYTO. Articles appear in NYTO in essentially the same way they appear in NEXIS, i.e., with identifying information (author, title, etc.), but without original formatting or accompanying images.~    ~    ~      12~      GPO contains articles from approximately 200 publications or sections of publications. Unlike NEXIS and NYTO, GPO is an image-based, rather than a text-based, system. The Times has licensed GPO to provide a facsimile of the Times' Sunday Book Review and Magazine. UMI \"burns\" images of each page of these sections onto CD-ROMs. The CD-ROMs show each article exactly as it appeared on printed pages, complete with photographs, captions, advertisements, and other surrounding materials. UMI provides an index and abstracts of all the articles in GPO.~    ~    ~      13~      Articles are accessed through NYTO and GPO much as they are accessed through NEXIS. The user enters a search query using similar criteria (e.g., author, headline, date). The computer program searches available indexes and abstracts, and retrieves a list of results matching the query. The user then may view each article within the search result, and may print the article or download it to a disc. The display of each article provides no links to articles appearing on other pages of the original print publications.2~    ~    B~    ~      14~      On December 16, 1993, the Authors filed this civil action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Authors alleged that their copyrights were infringed when, as permitted and facilitated by the Print Publishers, LEXIS/NEXIS and UMI (Electronic Publishers) placed the Articles in the NEXIS, NYTO, and GPO databases (Databases). The Authors sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and damages. In response to the Authors' complaint, the Print and Electronic Publishers raised the reproduction and distribution privilege accorded collective work copyright owners by 17 U.S.C.  201(c). After discovery, both sides moved for summary judgment.~    ~    ~      15~      The District Court granted summary judgment for the Publishers, holding that 201(c) shielded the Database reproductions. 972 F. Supp. 804, 806 (1997). The privilege conferred by 201(c) is transferable, the court first concluded, and therefore could be conveyed from the original Print Publishers to the Electronic Publishers. Id., at 816. Next, the court determined, the Databases reproduced and distributed the Authors' works, in 201(c)'s words, \"as part of   [a] revision of that collective work\" to which the Authors had first contributed. To qualify as \"revisions,\" according to the court, works need only \"preserve some significant original aspect of [collective works] whether an original selection or an original arrangement.\" Id., at 821. This criterion was met, in the District Court's view, because the Databases preserved the Print Publishers' \"selection of articles\" by copying all of the articles originally assembled in the periodicals' daily or weekly issues. Id., at 823. The Databases \"highlight[ed]\" the connection between the articles and the print periodicals, the court observed, by showing for each article not only the author and periodical, but also the print publication's particular issue and page numbers. Id., at 824 (\"[T]he electronic technologies not only copy the publisher defendants' complete original 'selection' of articles, they tag those articles in such a way that the publisher defendants' original selection remains evidentonline.\").~    ~    ~      16~      The Authors appealed, and the Second Circuit reversed. 206 F.3d 161 (1999). The Court of Appeals granted summary judgment for the Authors on the ground that the Databases were not among the collective works covered by 201(c), and specifically, were not \"revisions\" of the periodicals in which the Articles first appeared. Id., at 167-170. Just as 201(c) does not \"permit a Publisher to sell a hard copy of an Author's article directly to the public even if the Publisher also offered for individual sale all of the other articles from the particular edition,\" the court reasoned, so 201(c) does not allow a Publisher to \"achieve the same goal indirectly\" through computer databases. Id., at 168. In the Second Circuit's view, the Databases effectively achieved this result by providing multitudes of \"individually retrievable\" articles. Ibid. As stated by the Court of Appeals, the Databases might fairly be described as containing \"new antholog[ies] of innumerable\" editions or publications, but they do not qualify as \"revisions\" of particular editions of periodicals in the Databases. Id., at 169. Having concluded that 201(c) \"does not permit the Publishers,\" acting without the author's consent, \"to license individually copyrighted works for inclusion in the electronic databases,\" the court did not reach the question whether the 201(c) privilege is transferable. Id., at 165, and n. 2.~    ~    ~      17~      We granted certiorari to determine whether the copying of the Authors' Articles in the Databases is privileged by 17 U.S.C.  201(c). 531 U.S. 978 (2000). Like the Court of Appeals, we conclude that the 201(c) privilege does not override the Authors' copyrights, for the Databases do not reproduce and distribute the Articles as part of a collective work privileged by 201(c). Accordingly, and again like the Court of Appeals, we find it unnecessary to determine whether the privilege is transferable.~    ~    II~    ~      18~      Under the Copyright Act, as amended in 1976, \"[c]opyright protection subsists   in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression   from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated.\" 17 U.S.C.  102(a). When, as in this case, a freelance author has contributed an article to a \"collective work\" such as a newspaper or magazine, see 101 (defining \"collective work\"), the statute recognizes two distinct copyrighted works: \"Copyright in each separate contribution to a collective work is distinct from copyright in the collective work as a whole   .\" 201(c) (emphasis added). Copyright in the separate contribution \"vests initially in the author of the contribution\" (here, the freelancer). Ibid. Copyright in the collective work vests in the collective author (here, the newspaper or magazine publisher) and extends only to the creative material contributed by that author, not to \"the preexisting material employed in the work,\" 103(b). See also Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340, 358 (1991) (copyright in \"compilation\" a term that includes \"collective works,\" 17 U.S.C.  101 is limited to the compiler's original \"selection, coordination, and arrangement\").~    ~    ~      19~      Prior to the 1976 revision, as the courts below recognized, see 206 F.3d, at 168; 972 F. Supp., at 815, authors risked losing their rights when they placed an article in a collective work. Pre-1976 copyright law recognized a freelance author's copyright in a published article only when the article was printed with a copyright notice in the author's name. See Copyright Act of 1909, 18, 35 Stat. 1079. When publishers, exercising their superior bargaining power over authors, declined to print notices in each contributor's name, the author's copyright was put in jeopardy. See A. Kaminstein, Divisibility of Copyrights, Study No. 11, in Copyright Law Revision Studies Nos. 11-13, prepared for the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 86th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 18 (1960). The author did not have the option to assign only the right of publication in the periodical; such a partial assignment was blocked by the doctrine of copyright \"indivisibility.\" See id., at 11. Thus, when a copyright notice appeared only in the publisher's name, the author's work would fall into the public domain, unless the author's copyright, in its entirety, had passed to the publisher. See id., at 18. Such complete transfer might be accomplished by a contract, perhaps one with a provision, not easily enforced, for later retransfer of rights back to the author. See id., at 20-22. Or, absent a specific contract, a court might find that an author had tacitly transferred the entire copyright to a publisher, in turn deemed to hold the copyright in \"trust\" for the author's benefit. See id., at 18-19; see generally 3 M. Nimmer, Copyright 10.01[C][2], pp. 10-12 to 10-14 (2000).~    ~    ~      20~      In the 1976 revision, Congress acted to \"clarify and improve [this] confused and frequently unfair legal situation with respect to rights in contributions.\" H. R. Rep. No. 94-1476, p. 122 (1976) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.).3 The 1976 Act rejected the doctrine of indivisibility, recasting the copyright as a bundle of discrete \"exclusive rights,\" 17 U.S.C.  106 (1994 ed. and Supp. V),4 each of which \"may be transferred   and owned separately,\" 201(d)(2).5 Congress also provided, in 404(a), that \"a single notice applicable to the collective work as a whole is sufficient\" to protect the rights of freelance contributors. And in 201(c), Congress codified the discrete domains of \"[c]opyright in each separate contribution to a collective work\" and \"copyright in the collective work as a whole.\" Together, 404(a) and 201(c) \"preserve the author's copyright in a contribution even if the contribution does not bear a separate notice in the author's name, and without requiring any unqualified transfer of rights to the owner of the collective work.\" H. R. Rep. 122.~    ~    ~      21~      Section 201(c) both describes and circumscribes the \"privilege\" a publisher acquires regarding an author's contribution to a collective work:~    ~    ~      22~      \"In the absence of an express transfer of the copyright or of any rights under it, the owner of copyright in the collective work is presumed to have acquired only the privilege of reproducing and distributing the contribution as part of that particular collective work, any revision of that collective work, and any later collective work in the same series.\" (Emphasis added.)A newspaper or magazine publisher is thus privileged to reproduce or distribute an article contributed by a freelance author, absent a contract otherwise providing, only \"as part of\" any (or all) of three categories of collective works: (a) \"that collective work\" to which the author contributed her work, (b) \"any revision of that collective work,\" or (c) \"any later collective work in the same series.\" In accord with Congress' prescription, a \"publishing company could reprint a contribution from one issue in a later issue of its magazine, and could reprint an article from a 1980 edition of an encyclopedia in a 1990 revision of it; the publisher could not revise the contribution itself or include it in a new anthology or an entirely different magazine or other collective work.\" H. R. Rep. 122-123.~    ~    ~      23~      Essentially, 201(c) adjusts a publisher's copyright in its collective work to accommodate a freelancer's copyright in her contribution. If there is demand for a freelance article standing alone or in a new collection, the Copyright Act allows the freelancer to benefit from that demand; after authorizing initial publication, the freelancer may also sell the article to others. Cf. Stewart v. Abend, 495 U.S. 207, 229 (1990) (\"[w]hen an author produces a work which later commands a higher price in the market than the original bargain provided, the copyright statute [i.e., the separate renewal term of former 17 U.S.C.  24] is designed to provide the author the power to negotiate for the realized value of the work\"); id., at 230 (noting author's \"inalienable termination right\" under current 17 U.S.C.  203 302). It would scarcely \"preserve the author's copyright in a contribution\" as contemplated by Congress, H. R. Rep. 122, if a newspaper or magazine publisher were permitted to reproduce or distribute copies of the author's contribution in isolation or within new collective works. See Gordon, Fine-Tuning Tasini: Privileges of Electronic Distribution and Reproduction, 66 Brooklyn L. Rev. 473, 484 (2000).6~    ~    III~    ~      24~      In the instant case, the Authors wrote several Articles and gave the Print Publishers permission to publish the Articles in certain newspapers and magazines. It is undisputed that the Authors hold copyrights and, therefore, exclusive rights in the Articles.7 It is clear, moreover, that the Print and Electronic Publishers have exercised at least some rights that 106 initially assigns exclusively to the Authors: LEXIS/NEXIS' central discs and UMI's CD-ROMs \"reproduce   copies\" of the Articles, 106(1); UMI, by selling those CD-ROMs, and LEXIS/NEXIS, by selling copies of the Articles through the NEXIS Database, \"distribute copies\" of the Articles \"to the public by sale,\" 106(3); and the Print Publishers, through contracts licensing the production of copies in the Databases, \"authorize\" reproduction and distribution of the Articles, 106.8~    ~    ~      25~      Against the Authors' charge of infringement, the Publishers do not here contend the Authors entered into an agreement authorizing reproduction of the Articles in the Databases. See supra, at 3, n. 1. Nor do they assert that the copies in the Databases represent \"fair use\" of the Authors' Articles. See 17 U.S.C.  107 (\"fair use of a copyrighted work   is not an infringement\"; four factors identified among those relevant to fair use determination). Instead, the Publishers rest entirely on the privilege described in 201(c). Each discrete edition of the periodicals in which the Articles appeared is a \"collective work,\" the Publishers agree. They contend, however, that reproduction and distribution of each Article by the Databases lie within the \"privilege of reproducing and distributing the [Articles] as part of   [a] revision of that collective work,\" 201(c). The Publishers' encompassing construction of the 201(c) privilege is unacceptable, we conclude, for it would diminish the Authors' exclusive rights in the Articles.~    ~    ~      26~      In determining whether the Articles have been reproduced and distributed \"as part of\" a \"revision\" of the collective works in issue, we focus on the Articles as presented to, and perceptible by, the user of the Databases. See 102 (copyright protection subsists in original works fixed in any medium \"from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated\"); see also 101 (definitions of \"copies\" and \"fixed\"); Haemmerli, Commentary: Tasini v. New York Times Co., 22 Colum.-VLA. J. L.  Arts 129, 142-143 (1998). In this case, the three Databases present articles to users clear of the context provided either by the original periodical editions or by any revision of those editions. The Databases first prompt users to search the universe of their contents: thousands or millions of files containing individual articles from thousands of collective works (i.e., editions), either in one series (the Times, in NYTO) or in scores of series (the sundry titles in NEXIS and GPO). When the user conducts a search, each article appears as a separate item within the search result. In NEXIS and NYTO, an article appears to a user without the graphics, formatting, or other articles with which the article was initially published. In GPO, the article appears with the other materials published on the same page or pages, but without any material published on other pages of the original periodical. In either circumstance, we cannot see how the Database perceptibly reproduces and distributes the article \"as part of \" either the original edition or a \"revision\" of that edition.~    ~    ~      27~      One might view the articles as parts of a new compendium namely, the entirety of works in the Database. In that compendium, each edition of each periodical represents only a miniscule fraction of the ever-expanding Database. The Database no more constitutes a \"revision\" of each constituent edition than a 400-page novel quoting a sonnet in passing would represent a \"revision\" of that poem. \"Revision\" denotes a new \"version,\" and a version is, in this setting, a \"distinct form of something regarded by its creators or others as one work.\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1944, 2545 (1976). The massive whole of the Database is not recognizable as a new version of its every small part.~    ~    ~      28~      Alternatively, one could view the Articles in the Databases \"as part of\" no larger work at all, but simply as individual articles presented individually. That each article bears marks of its origin in a particular periodical (less vivid marks in NEXIS and NYTO, more vivid marks in GPO) suggests the article was previously part of that periodical. But the markings do not mean the article is currently reproduced or distributed as part of the periodical. The Databases' reproduction and distribution of individual Articles simply as individual Articles would invade the core of the Authors' exclusive rights under 106.9~    ~    ~      29~      The Publishers press an analogy between the Databases, on the one hand, and microfilm and microfiche, on the other. We find the analogy wanting. Microforms typically contain continuous photographic reproductions of a periodical in the medium of miniaturized film. Accordingly, articles appear on the microforms, writ very small, in precisely the position in which the articles appeared in the newspaper. The Times, for example, printed the beginning of Blakely's \"Remembering Jane\" Article on page 26 of the Magazine in the September 23, 1990, edition; the microfilm version of the Times reproduces that same Article on film in the very same position, within a film reproduction of the entire Magazine, in turn within a reproduction of the entire September 23, 1990, edition. True, the microfilm roll contains multiple editions, and the microfilm user can adjust the machine lens to focus only on the Article, to the exclusion of surrounding material. Nonetheless, the user first encounters the Article in context. In the Databases, by contrast, the Articles appear disconnected from their original context. In NEXIS and NYTO, the user sees the \"Jane\" Article apart even from the remainder of page 26. In GPO, the user sees the Article within the context of page 26, but clear of the context of page 25 or page 27, the rest of the Magazine, or the remainder of the day's newspaper. In short, unlike microforms, the Databases do not perceptibly reproduce articles as part of the collective work to which the author contributed or as part of any \"revision\" thereof.10~    ~    ~      30~      Invoking the concept of \"media neutrality,\" the Publishers urge that the \"transfer of a work between media\" does not \"alte[r] the character of\" that work for copyright purposes. Brief for Petitioners 23. That is indeed true. See 17 U.S.C.  102(a) (copyright protection subsists in original works \"fixed in any tangible medium of expression\"). But unlike the conversion of newsprint to microfilm, the transfer of articles to the Databases does not represent a mere conversion of intact periodicals (or revisions of periodicals) from one medium to another. The Databases offer users individual articles, not intact periodicals. In this case, media neutrality should protect the Authors' rights in the individual Articles to the extent those Articles are now presented individually, outside the collective work context, within the Databases' new media.11~    ~    ~      31~      For the purpose at hand determining whether the Authors' copyrights have been infringed an analogy to an imaginary library may be instructive.12 Rather than maintaining intact editions of periodicals, the library would contain separate copies of each article. Perhaps these copies would exactly reproduce the periodical pages from which the articles derive (if the model is GPO); perhaps the copies would contain only typescript characters, but still indicate the original periodical's name and date, as well as the article's headline and page number (if the model is NEXIS or NYTO). The library would store the folders containing the articles in a file room, indexed based on diverse criteria, and containing articles from vast numbers of editions. In response to patron requests, an inhumanly speedy librarian would search the room and provide copies of the articles matching patron-specified criteria.~    ~    ~      32~      Viewing this strange library, one could not, consistent with ordinary English usage, characterize the articles \"as part of\" a \"revision\" of the editions in which the articles first appeared. In substance, however, the Databases differ from the file room only to the extent they aggregate articles in electronic packages (the LEXIS/NEXIS central discs or UMI CD-ROMs), while the file room stores articles in spatially separate files. The crucial fact is that the Databases, like the hypothetical library, store and retrieve articles separately within a vast domain of diverse texts. Such a storage and retrieval system effectively overrides the Authors' exclusive right to control the individual reproduction and distribution of each Article, 17 U.S.C.  106(1), (3). Cf. Ryan v. Carl Corp., 23 F. Supp. 2d 1146 (ND Cal. 1998) (holding copy shop in violation of 201(c)).~    ~    ~      33~      The Publishers claim the protection of 201(c) because users can manipulate the Databases to generate search results consisting entirely of articles from a particular periodical edition. By this logic, 201(c) would cover the hypothetical library if, in response to a request, that library's expert staff assembled all of the articles from a particular periodical edition. However, the fact that a third party can manipulate a database to produce a noninfringing document does not mean the database is not infringing. Under 201(c), the question is not whether a user can generate a revision of a collective work from a database, but whether the database itself perceptibly presents the author's contribution as part of a revision of the collective work. That result is not accomplished by these Databases.~    ~    ~      34~      The Publishers finally invoke Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417 (1984). That decision, however, does not genuinely aid their argument. Sony held that the \"sale of copying equipment\" does not constitute contributory infringement if the equipment is \"capable of substantial noninfringing uses.\" Id., at 442. The Publishers suggest that their Databases could be liable only under a theory of contributory infringement, based on end-user conduct, which the Authors did not plead. The Electronic Publishers, however, are not merely selling \"equipment\"; they are selling copies of the Articles. And, as we have explained, it is the copies themselves, without any manipulation by users, that fall outside the scope of the 201(c) privilege.~    ~    IV~    ~      35~      The Publishers warn that a ruling for the Authors will have \"devastating\" consequences. Brief for Petitioners 49. The Databases, the Publishers note, provide easy access to complete newspaper texts going back decades. A ruling for the Authors, the Publishers suggest, will punch gaping holes in the electronic record of history. The Publishers' concerns are echoed by several historians, see Brief for Ken Burns et al. as Amici Curiae, but discounted by several other historians, see Brief for Ellen Schrecker et al. as Amici Curiae; Brief for Authors' Guild, Jacques Barzun et al. as Amici Curiae.~    ~    ~      36~      Notwithstanding the dire predictions from some quarters, see also post, at 16 (Stevens, J., dissenting), it hardly follows from today's decision that an injunction against the inclusion of these Articles in the Databases (much less all freelance articles in any databases) must issue. See 17 U.S.C.  502(a) (court \"may\" enjoin infringement); Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 578, n. 10 (1994) (goals of copyright law are \"not always best served by automatically granting injunctive relief\"). The parties (Authors and Publishers) may enter into an agreement allowing continued electronic reproduction of the Authors' works; they, and if necessary the courts and Congress, may draw on numerous models for distributing copyrighted works and remunerating authors for their distribution. See, e.g., 17 U.S.C.  118(b); Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U.S. 1, 4-6, 10-12 (1979) (recounting history of blanket music licensing regimes and consent decrees governing their operation).13 In any event, speculation about future harms is no basis for this Court to shrink authorial rights Congress established in 201(c). Agreeing with the Court of Appeals that the Publishers are liable for infringement, we leave remedial issues open for initial airing and decision in the District Court.~    ~    ~      37~      * * *~    ~    ~      38~      We conclude that the Electronic Publishers infringed the Authors' copyrights by reproducing and distributing the Articles in a manner not authorized by the Authors and not privileged by 201(c). We further conclude that the Print Publishers infringed the Authors' copyrights by authorizing the Electronic Publishers to place the Articles in the Databases and by aiding the Electronic Publishers in that endeavor. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.~    ~    ~      39~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      40~      (FNStevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Breyer, J., joined.~    ~    ~      41~      1).      In the District Court, Newsday and Time contended that the freelancers who wrote for their publications had entered into agreements authorizing reproduction of the Articles in the databases. The Court of Appeals ruled that Newsday's defense was waived, and rejected Time's argument on the merits. Neither petitioner presses the contention here.~    ~    ~      ~        2~          For example, the GPO user who retrieves Blakely's \"Remembering Jane\" article will see the entirety of Magazine page 26, where the article begins, and Magazine page 78, where the article continues and ends. The NYTO user who retrieves Blakely's article will see only the text of the article and its identifying information (author, headline, publication, page number, etc.). Neither the GPO retrieval nor the NYTO retrieval produces any text on page 27, page 79, or any other page. The user who wishes to see other pages may not simply \"flip\" to them. She must conduct a new search.~      ~      ~        3~          Two Registers of Copyrights have observed that the 1976 revision of the Copyright Act represented \"a break with the two-hundred-year-old tradition that has identified copyright more closely with the publisher than with the author.\" Letter from M. Peters to Rep. McGovern, reprinted in 147 Cong. Rec. E182 (Feb. 14, 2001) (hereinafter Peters Letter) (quoting Ringer, First Thoughts on the Copyright Act of 1976, 22 N. Y. L. S. L. Rev. 477, 490 (1977)). The intent to enhance the author's position vis-a-vis the patron is also evident in the 1976 Act's work-for-hire provisions. See Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 490 U.S. 730, 742-750 (1989); see also 17 U.S.C.  203(a)(5) (inalienable authorial right to revoke a copyright transfer). Congress' adjustment of the author/publisher balance is a permissible expression of the \"economic philosophy behind the [Copyright Clause],\" i.e., \"the conviction that encouragement of individual effort [motivated] by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare.\" Harper  Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539, 558 (1985) (quoting Mazer v.

We are not so certain. When the reader of an article in a periodical wishes to obtain other works by the article's author, the Databases enable that reader simply to print out the author's articles, without buying a \"new anthology   or other collective work,\" H. R. Rep. 122-123. In years past, books compiling stories by journalists such as Janet Flanner and Ernie Pyle might have sold less well had the individual articles been freely and permanently available on line. In the present, print collections of reviews, commentaries, and reportage may prove less popular because of the Databases. The Register of Copyrights reports that \"freelance authors have experienced significant economic loss\" due to a \"digital revolution that has given publishers [new] opportunities to exploit authors' works.\" Peters Letter E182. More to the point, even if the dissent is correct that some authors, in the long-run, are helped, not hurt, by Database reproductions, the fact remains that the Authors who brought the case now before us have asserted their rights under 201(c). We may not invoke our conception of their interests to diminish those rights.~      ~      ~        7~          The Publishers do not claim that the Articles are \"work[s] made for hire.\" 17 U.S.C.  201(b). As to such works, the employer or person for whom a work was prepared is treated as the author. Ibid. The Print Publishers, however, neither engaged the Authors to write the Articles as \"employee[s]\" nor \"commissioned\" the Articles through \"a written instrument signed by [both parties]\" indicating that the Articles shall be considered \"work[s] made for hire.\" 101 (1994 ed., Supp. V) (defining \"work made for hire\").~      ~      ~        8~           Satisfied that the Publishers exercised rights 106 initially assigns exclusively to the Author, we need resolve no more on that score. Thus, we do not reach an issue the Register of Copyrights has argued vigorously. The Register maintains that the Databases publicly \"display\" the Articles, 106(5); because 201(c) does not privilege \"display,\" the Register urges, the 201(c) privilege does not shield the Databases. See Peters Letter E182-E183.~      ~      ~        9~          The dissenting opinion takes as its starting point \"what is sent from the New York Times to the Electronic Databases.\" See post, at 6-11. This case, however, is not ultimately about what is sent between Publishers in an intermediate step of Database production; it is about what is presented to the general public in the Databases. See supra, at 14. Those Databases simply cannot bear characterization as a \"revision\" of any one periodical edition. We would reach the same conclusion if the Times sent intact newspapers to the Electronic Publishers.~      ~      ~        10~          The Court of Appeals concluded NEXIS was infringing partly because that Database did \"almost nothing to preserve the copyrightable aspects of the [Print] Publishers' collective works,\" i.e., their original \"selection, coordination, and arrangement.\" 206 F.3d 161, 168 (CA2 1999). We do not pass on this issue. It suffices to hold that the Databases do not contain \"revisions\" of the Print Publishers' works \"as part of\" which the Articles are reproduced and distributed.~      ~      ~        11~          The dissenting opinion apparently concludes that, under the banner of \"media-neutrality,\" a copy of a collective work, even when considerably changed, must constitute a \"revision\" of that collective work so long as the changes were \"necessitated by   the medium.\" Post, at 9. We lack the dissent's confidence that the current form of the Databases is entirely attributable to the nature of the electronic media, rather than the nature of the economic market served by the Databases. In any case, we see no grounding in 201(c) for a \"medium-driven\" necessity defense, post, at 9, n. 11, to the Authors' infringement claims. Furthermore, it bears reminder here and throughout that these Publishers and all others can protect their interests by private contractual arrangement.~      ~      ~        12~          The Publishers have frequently referred to their products as \"electronic libraries.\" We need not decide whether the Databases come within the legal coverage of the term \"libraries\" as used in the Copyright Act. For even if the Databases are \"libraries,\" the Copyright Act's special authorizations for libraries do not cover the Databases' reproductions. See, e.g., 17 U.S.C.  108(a)(1) (reproduction authorized \"without any purpose of direct or indirect commercial advantage\"); 108(b)(reproduction authorized \"solely for purposes of preservation and security or for deposit for research use\"); 108(c) (1994 ed., Supp. V) (reproduction \"solely for the purpose of replacement of a copy or phonorecord that is damaged, deteriorating, lost, or stolen, or if the existing format in which the work is stored has become obsolete\").~      ~      ~        13~          Courts in other nations, applying their domestic copyright laws, have also concluded that Internet or CD-ROM reproduction and distribution of freelancers' works violate the copyrights of freelancers. See, e.g., Union Syndicale des Journalistes Franais v. SDV Plurimdia (T.G.I., Strasbourg, Fr., Feb. 3, 1998), in Lodging of International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) as Amicus Curiae; S. C. R. L. Central Station v. Association Generale des Journalistes Professionnels de Belgique (CA, Brussels, Belg., 9e ch., Oct. 28, 1997), transl. and ed. in 22 Colum.-VLA J. L.  Arts 195 (1998); Heg v. De Volskrant B. V. (Dist. Ct., Amsterdam, Neth., Sept. 24, 1997), transl. and ed. in 22 Colum.-VLA J. L.  Arts, at 181. After the French Plurimdia decision, the journalists' union and the newspaper-defendant entered into an agreement compensating authors for the continued electronic reproduction of their works. See FR3 v. Syndicats de Journalistes (CA, Colmar, Sept. 15, 1998), in Lodging of IFJ as Amicus Curiae. In Norway, it has been reported, a similar agreement was reached. See Brief for IFJ as Amicus Curiae 18.~      ~    ~    ~      42~      Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Breyer joins, dissenting.~    ~    ~      43~      This case raises an issue of first impression concerning the meaning of the word \"revision\" as used in 201(c) of the 1976 revision of the Copyright Act of 1909 (1976 Act). Ironically, the Court today seems unwilling to acknowledge that changes in a collective work far less extensive than those made to prior copyright law by the 1976 \"revision\" do not merit the same characterization.~    ~    ~      44~      To explain my disagreement with the Court's holding, I shall first identify Congress' principal goals in passing the 1976 Act's changes in the prior law with respect to collective works. I will then discuss two analytically separate questions that are blended together in the Court's discussion of revisions. The first is whether the electronic versions of the collective works created by the owners of the copyright in those works (Print Publishers or publishers) are \"revision[s]\" of those works within the meaning of 17 U.S.C.  201(c). In my judgment they definitely are. The second is whether the aggregation by LEXIS/NEXIS and UMI (Electronic Databases) of the revisions with other editions of the same periodical or with other periodicals within a single database changes the equation. I think it does not. Finally, I will consider the implications of broader copyright policy for the issues presented in this case.~    ~    ~      45~      * As the majority correctly observes, prior to 1976, an author's decision to publish her individual article as part of a collective work was a perilous one. Although pre-1976 copyright law recognized the author's copyright in an individual article that was included within a collective work, those rights could be lost if the publisher refused to print the article with a copyright notice in the author's name. 3 M. Nimmer  D. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright 10.01[C][2], p. 10-12 (2001).~    ~    ~      46~      This harsh rule was, from the author's point of view, exacerbated by the pre-1976 doctrine of copyright \"indivisibility,\" which prevented an author from assigning only limited publication rights to the publisher of a collective work while holding back all other rights to herself.1 Ibid. The indivisibility of copyright, in combination with the danger of losing copyright protection, put significant pressure on an author seeking to preserve her copyright in the contribution to transfer the entire copyright over to the publisher in trust. See Kaminstein, Divisibility of Copyrights, Study No. 11, in Copyright Law Revision Studies Nos. 11-13, prepared for the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 86th Cong., 2d Sess., 18-22 (1960) (herinafter Kaminstein).2 Such authors were often at the mercy of publishers when they tried to reclaim their copyright. Id., at 21.3~    ~    ~      47~      The 1976 Act's extensive revisions of the copyright law had two principal goals with respect to the rights of freelance authors whose writings appeared as part of larger collective works. First, as the legislative history of 201(c) unambiguously reveals, one of its most significant aims was to \"preserve the author's copyright in a contribution even if the contribution does not bear a separate notice in the author's name, and without requiring any unqualified transfer of rights to the owner of the collective work.\" H. R. Rep. No. 94-1476, p. 122 (1976) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.) (discussing the purpose of 201(c)). Indeed, 404(a) states that \"a single notice applicable to the collective work as a whole is sufficient\" to protect the author's rights.~    ~    ~      48~      The second significant change effected by the 1976 Act clarified the scope of the privilege granted to the publisher of a collective work. While pre-1976 law had the effect of encouraging an author to transfer her entire copyright to the publisher of a collective work, 201(c) creates the opposite incentive, stating that, absent some agreement to the contrary, the publisher acquires from the author only \"the privilege of reproducing and distributing the contribution as part of that particular collective work, any revision of that collective work, and any later collective work in the same series.\"4 Congress intended this limitation on what the author is presumed to give away primarily to keep publishers from \"revis[ing] the contribution itself or includ[ing] it in a new anthology or an entirely different magazine or other collective work.\" H. R. Rep. 122-123.5~    ~    ~      49~      The majority is surely correct that the 1976 Act's new approach to collective works was an attempt to \" 'clarify and improve the   confused and frequently unfair legal situation' \" that existed under the prior regime. Id., at 122. It is also undoubtedly true that the drafters of the 1976 Act hoped to \"enhance the author's position vis-a-vis the patron.\" Ante, at 9, n. 3. It does not follow, however, that Congress' efforts to \"preserve the author's copyright in a contribution,\" H. R. Rep. 122, can only be honored by a finding in favor of the respondent authors.~    ~    ~      50~      Indeed, the conclusion that the petitioners' actions were lawful is fully consistent with both of Congress' principal goals for collective works in the 1976 Act. First, neither the publication of the collective works by the Print Publishers, nor their transfer to the Electronic Databases had any impact on the legal status of the copyrights of the respondents' individual contributions.6 By virtue of the 1976 Act, respondents remain the owners of the copyright in their individual works. Moreover, petitioners neither modified respondents' individual contributions nor, as I will show in Part II, published them in a \"new anthology or an entirely different magazine or other collective work.\" H. R. Rep. 122-123 (emphasis added). Because I do not think it is at all obvious that the decision the majority reaches today is a result clearly intended by the 1976 Congress, I disagree with the Court's conclusion that a ruling in petitioners' favor would \"shrink authorial rights\" that \"Congress [has] established.\" Ante, at 21 (emphasis added).~    ~    II~    ~      51~      Not only is petitioners' position consistent with Congress' general goals in the 1976 Act, it is also consistent with the text of 201(c). That provision allows the publisher of a collective work to \"reproduc[e] and distribut[e] the contribution as part of that particular collective work, any revision of that collective work, and any later collective work in the same series.\" The central question in this case, then, is whether petitioners are correct when they argue that publication of the respondents' articles in the various Electronic Databases at issue in this case is nothing more than \"reproduc[tion] and distribut[ion] [of] the contribution as part of   revision[s] of [the original] collective work[s]\" in which respondents' articles appeared. I agree with petitioners that neither the conversion of the Print Publishers' collective works from printed to electronic form, nor the transmission of those electronic versions of the collective works to the Electronic Databases, nor even the actions of the Electronic Databases once they receive those electronic versions does anything to deprive those electronic versions of their status as mere \"revision[s]\" of the original collective works.~    ~    ~      52~      A proper analysis of this case benefits from an incremental approach. Accordingly, I begin by discussing an issue the majority largely ignores: whether a collection of articles from a single edition of the New York Times (i.e., the batch of files the Print Publishers periodically send to the Electronic Databases) constitutes a \"revision\" of an individual edition of the paper. In other words, does a single article within such a collection exist as \"part of\" a \"revision\"? Like the majority, I believe that the crucial inquiry is whether the article appears within the \"context\" of the original collective work. Ante, at 16. But this question simply raises the further issue of precisely how much \"context\" is enough.~    ~    ~      53~      The record indicates that what is sent from the New York Times to the Electronic Databases (with the exception of General Periodicals on Disc (GPO)) is simply a collection of ASCII text files representing the editorial content of the New York Times for a particular day.7 App. 73a. Each individual ASCII file contains the text of a single article as well as additional coding intended to help readers identify the context in which the article originally appeared and to facilitate database searches. Thus, for example, to the original text of an article, the New York Times adds information on the article's \"headline, byline and title,\" \"the section of the paper in which the article had originally appeared,\" and \"the page in the paper or periodical on which the article had first appeared.\" Id., at 75a-76a.8~    ~    ~      54~      I see no compelling reason why a collection of files corresponding to a single edition of the New York Times, standing alone, cannot constitute a \"revision\" of that day's New York Times. It might be argued, as respondents appear to do, that the presentation of each article within its own electronic file makes it impossible to claim that the collection of files as a whole amounts to a \"revision.\" Brief for Respondents Tasini et al. 34. But the conversion of the text of the overall collective work into separate electronic files should not, by itself, decide the question. After all, one of the hallmarks of copyright policy, as the majority recognizes, ante, at 17, is the principle of media neutrality. See H. R. Rep. 53.~    ~    ~      55~      No one doubts that the New York Times has the right to reprint its issues in Braille, in a foreign language, or in microform, even though such revisions might look and feel quite different from the original. Such differences, however, would largely result from the different medium being employed. Similarly, the decision to convert the single collective work newspaper into a collection of individual ASCII files can be explained as little more than a decision that reflects the different nature of the electronic medium. Just as the paper version of the New York Times is divided into \"sections\" and \"pages\" in order to facilitate the reader's navigation and manipulation of large batches of newsprint, so too the decision to subdivide the electronic version of that collective work into individual article files facilitates the reader's use of the electronic information. The bare-bones nature of ASCII text would make trying to wade through a single ASCII file containing the entire content of a single edition of the New York Times an exercise in frustration.9~    ~    ~      56~      Although the Court does not separately discuss the question whether the groups of files that the New York Times sends to the Electronic Databases constitute \"revision[s],\" its reasoning strongly suggests that it would not accept such a characterization. The majority, for example, places significant emphasis on the differences between the various Electronic Databases and microform, a medium that admittedly qualifies as a revision under 201(c).10 As with the conversion of individual editions into collections of separate article-files, however, many of the differences between the electronic versions and microform are necessitated by the electronic medium. The Court therefore appears to back away from principles of media neutrality when it implicitly criticizes ASCII-text files for their inability to reproduce \"Remembering Jane\" \"in the very same position, within a film reproduction of the entire Magazine, in turn within a reproduction of the entire September 23, 1990, edition.\" Ante, at 16.11~    ~    ~      57~      In contrast, I think that a proper respect for media neutrality suggests that the New York Times, reproduced as a collection of individual ASCII files, should be treated as a \"revision\" of the original edition, as long as each article explicitly refers to the original collective work and as long as substantially the rest of the collective work is, at the same time, readily accessible to the reader of the individual file. In this case, no one disputes that the first pieces of information a user sees when looking at an individual ASCII article file are the name of the publication in which the article appeared, the edition of that publication, and the location of the article within that edition. I agree with the majority that such labeling alone is insufficient to establish that the individual file exists as \"part of\" a revision of the original collective work. See ante, at 15. But such labeling is not all there is in the group of files sent to the Electronic Databases.~    ~    ~      58~      In addition to the labels, the batch of electronic files contains the entire editorial content of the original edition of the New York Times for that day. That is, while I might agree that a single article, standing alone, even when coded with identifying information (e.g., publication, edition date, headline, etc.), should not be characterized as a \"part of\" a larger collective work, I would not say the same about an individual article existing as \"part of\" a collection of articles containing all the editorial content of that day's New York Times. This is all the more true because, as the District Court correctly noted, it is the Print Publishers' selection process, the editorial process by which the staff of the New York Times, for example, decides which articles will be included in \"All the News That's Fit to Print,\" that is the most important creative element they contribute to the collective works they publish. 972 F. Supp. 804, 823 (SDNY 1997).12 While such superficial features as page placement and column width are lost in ASCII format, the Print Publishers' all-important editorial selection is wholly preserved in the collection of individual article-files sent to the Electronic Databases.~    ~    ~      59~      To see why an electronic version of the New York Times made up of a group of individual ACSCII article-files, standing alone, may be considered a 201(c) revision, suppose that, instead of transmitting to NEXIS the articles making up a particular day's edition, the New York Times saves all of the individual files on a single floppy disk, labels that disk \"New York Times, October 31, 2000,\" and sells copies of the disk to users as the electronic version of that day's New York Times. The disk reproduces the creative, editorial selection of that edition of the New York Times. The reader, after all, has at his finger tips substantially all of the relevant content of the October 31 edition of the collective work. Moreover, each individual article makes explicit reference to that selection by including tags that remind the reader that it is a part of the New York Times for October 31, 2000. Such a disk might well constitute \"that particular collective work\"; it would surely qualify as a \"revision\" of the original collective work. Yet all the features identified as essential by the majority and by the respondents would still be lacking. An individual looking at one of the articles contained on the disk would still see none of the original formatting context and would still be unable to flip the page.~    ~    ~      60~      Once one accepts the premise that a disk containing all the files from the October 31, 2000, New York Times can constitute a \"revision,\" there is no reason to treat any differently the same set of files, stored in a folder on the hard disk of a computer at the New York Times. Thus, at least before it is republished by the Electronic Databases, the collection of files that the New York Times transmits to them constitutes a revision, in electronic form, of a particular edition of the New York Times.~    ~    III~    ~      61~      The next question, then, is whether anything that the Electronic Databases do to the transmitted \"revision\" strips it of that status. The heart of the Court's reasoning in this respect, as I understand it, is that, once received and processed by Electronic Databases, the data transmitted by the New York Times cannot be viewed as \"revisions\" within the meaning of 201(c) because of the way that data is stored and made available to the public by those Databases. First, the Court points to the fact that \"the three Databases present articles to users clear of the context provided either by the original periodical editions or by any revision of those editions.\" Ante, at 14. I have already addressed these formatting concerns. Second, and not wholly unrelated to the first point, however, the Court appears to think that the commingling of my hypothetical collection of ASCII article-files from the October 31, 2000, New York Times with similar collections of files from other editions of the New York Times (or from other periodicals) within one database would deprive that collection of revision status. See ibid. Even if my imaginary floppy disk could, in isolation, be considered a revision, the majority might say, that status would be lost if the floppy disk were to contain, not only the files from the October 31, 2000, New York Times, but also from the New York Times for every other day in 2000 (and other years) and from hundreds of other periodicals. I disagree.~    ~    ~      62~      If my hypothetical October 31, 2000, floppy disk can be a revision, I do not see why the inclusion of other editions and other periodicals is any more significant than the placement of a single edition of the New York Times in a large public library or in a book store. Each individual file still reminds the reader that he is viewing \"part of\" a particular collective work. And the entire editorial content of that work still exists at the reader's fingertips.13~    ~    ~      63~      It is true that, once the revision of the October 31, 2000, New York Times is surrounded by the additional content, it can be conceptualized as existing as part of an even larger collective work (e.g., the entire NEXIS database). See ante, at 14-15. The question then becomes whether this ability to conceive of a revision of a collective work as existing within a larger \"collective work\" changes the status of the original revision. Section 201(c)'s requirement that the article be published only as \"part of   any revision of that collective work\" does not compel any particular answer to that question. A microfilm of the New York Times for October 31, 2000, does not cease to be a revision of that individual collective work simply because it is stored on the same roll of film as other editions of the Times or on a library shelf containing hundreds of other microfilm periodicals. Nor does 201(c) compel the counterintuitive conclusion that the microfilm version of the Times would cease to be a revision simply because its publishers might choose to sell it on rolls of film that contained a year's editions of both the New York Times and the Herald-Tribune. Similarly, the placement of our hypothetical electronic revision of the October 31, 2000, New York Times within a larger electronic database does nothing to alter either the nature of our original electronic revision or the relationship between that revision and the individual articles that exist as \"part of \" it.~    ~    ~      64~      Finally, the mere fact that an individual user may either view or print copies of individual articles stored on the Electronic Databases does not change the nature of the revisions contained within those databases. The same media-specific necessities that allow the publishers to store and make available the original collective work as a collection of individual digital files make it reasonable for the Electronic Databases to enable the user to download or print only those files in which the user has a particular interest. But this is no different from microfilm. Just as nothing intrinsic in the nature of microfilm dictates to a user how much or how little of a microform edition of the New York Times she must copy, nothing intrinsic in the Electronic Databases dictates to a user how much (or how little) of a particular edition of the New York Times to view or print. It is up to the user in each instance to decide whether to employ the publisher's product in a manner that infringes either the publisher's or the author's copyright. And to the extent that the user's decision to make a copy of a particular article violates the author's copyright in that article, such infringing third-party behavior should not be attributed to the database.14 See Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 434 (1984).~    ~    IV~    ~      65~      My reading of \"revision,\" as encompassing products like the Electronic Databases, is not the only possible answer to the complex questions presented by this case. It is, nevertheless, one that is consistent with the statutory text and entirely faithful to the statute's purposes. Respect for the policies motivating its enactment, to which I now turn, makes it wrong for the Court to reject this reading of 201(c).~    ~    ~      66~      It is likely that the Congress that enacted the 1976 revision of the law of copyright did not anticipate the developments that occurred in the 1980s which gave rise to the practices challenged in this litigation. See Miller, Copyright Protection for Computer Programs, Databases, and Computer Generated Works: Is Anything New Since CONTU?, 106 Harv. L. Rev. 977, 979 (1993) (in 1976, \"Congress   decided to avoid grappling with technological issues that obviously required more study than the legislative process was then willing to give them\").15 Thus, in resolving ambiguities in the relevant text of the statute, we should be mindful of the policies underlying copyright law.~    ~    ~      67~      Macaulay wrote that copyright is \"a tax on readers for the purpose of giving a bounty to writers.\" T. Macaulay, Speeches on Copyright 11 (A. Thorndike ed. 1915) That tax restricts the dissemination of writings, but only insofar as necessary to encourage their production, the bounty's basic objective. See U.S. Const., Art. I, 8, cl. 8. In other words, \"[t]he primary purpose of copyright is not to reward the author, but is rather to secure 'the general benefits derived by the public from the labors of authors.' \" 1 M. Nimmer  D. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright 1.03[A] (2001) (quoting Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal, 286 U.S. 123, 127 (1932)); see also Breyer, The Uneasy Case for Copyright: A Study of Copyright in Books, Photocopies, and Computer Programs, 84 Harv. L. Rev. 281, 282 (1970) (discussing the twin goals of copyright law protecting the reader's desire for access to ideas and providing incentives for authors to produce them). The majority's decision today unnecessarily subverts this fundamental goal of copyright law in favor of a narrow focus on \"authorial rights.\" Ante, at 21. Although the desire to protect such rights is certainly a laudable sentiment,16 copyright law demands that \"private motivation must ultimately serve the cause of promoting broad public availability of literature, music, and the other arts.\" Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U.S. 151, 156 (1975) (emphasis added).~    ~    ~      68~      The majority discounts the effect its decision will have on the availability of comprehensive digital databases, ante, at 19-21, but I am not as confident. As petitioners' amici have persuasively argued, the difficulties of locating individual freelance authors and the potential of exposure to statutory damages may well have the effect of forcing electronic archives to purge freelance pieces from their databases.17 \"The omission of these materials from electronic collections, for any reason on a large scale or even an occasional basis, undermines the principal benefits that electronic archives offer historians efficiency, accuracy and comprehensiveness.\"18 Brief for Ken Burns et al. as Amici Curiae 13.~    ~    ~      69~      Moreover, it is far from clear that my position even deprives authors of much of anything (with the exception of perhaps the retrospective statutory damages that may well result from their victory today).19 Imagine, for example, that one of the contributions at issue in this case were a copyrighted version of John Keats' Ode on a Grecian Urn, published on page 29 of our hypothetical October 31, 2000, New York Times. Even under my reading of 201(c), Keats retains valuable copyright protection. No matter how well received his ode might be, it is unlikely although admittedly possible that it could be marketed as a stand-alone work of art. The ode, however, would be an obvious candidate for inclusion in an anthology of works by romantic poets, in a collection of poems by the same author, or even in \"a 400-page novel quoting a [poem] in passing,\" ante, at 15. The author's copyright would protect his right to compensation for any such use. Cf. Stewart v. Abend, 495 U.S. 207, 228 (1990) (discussing the value to authors of derivative works). Moreover, the value of the ode surely would be enhanced, not decreased, by the accessibility and readership of the October 31, 2000, edition of the New York Times. The ready availability of that edition, both at the time of its first publication and subsequently in libraries and electronic databases, would be a benefit, not an injury, to most authors. Keats would benefit from the poem's continued availability to database users, by his identification as the author of the piece, and by the database's indication of the fact that the poem first appeared in a prestigious periodical on a certain date. He would not care one whit whether the database indicated the formatting context of the page on which the poem appeared. What is overwhelmingly clear is that maximizing the readership of the ode would enhance the value of his remaining copyright uses.~    ~    ~      70~      Nor is it clear that Keats will gain any prospective benefits from a victory in this case. As counsel for petitioners represented at oral argument, since 1995, the New York Times has required freelance authors to grant the Times \"electronic rights\" to articles. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7. And the inclusion of such a term has had no effect on the compensation authors receive. See ibid. This is understandable because, even if one accepts the majority's characterization of the Electronic Databases as collections of freestanding articles, demand for databases like NEXIS probably does not reflect a \"demand for a freelance article standing alone,\" ante, at 11, to which the publishers are greedily helping themselves. Cf. Ryan v. Carl Corp., 23 F. Supp. 2d 1146, 1150-1151 (ND Cal. 1998) (\"[T]he value added by the publisher to a reproduced article is significant\").~    ~    ~      71~      Instead, it seems far more likely that demand for the Electronic Databases reflects demand for a product that will provide a user with the means to quickly search through scores of complete periodicals. The comments of historian Douglas Brinkley are instructive in this respect:~    ~    ~      72~      \" 'As an historian, when I want to write a biography, if I'm going to write a biography of Bill Clinton, the first thing I would do would be to index The New York Times. I would work through [the] microfiche and get any time Bill Clinton's name ever appeared in The New York Times. I'd get a copy of that. So you'd have boxes of files. So for each month, here's Clinton this month. You then would fill that in with   other obvious books or articles from Foreign Affairs or Foreign Policy or The New Yorker, or the like and you'd start getting your first biography of Bill Clinton.' \" Panel Discussion: The Observer's View (D. Brinkley, M. Frankel, H. Sidey), White House Historical Association (Nov. 16, 2000) (C-SPAN Archives No. 160577) (quoted in Brief for Ken Burns et al. as Amici Curiae 17).Users like Douglas Brinkley do not go to NEXIS because it contains a score of individual articles by Jonathan Tasini.20 Rather, they go to NEXIS because it contains a comprehensive and easily searchable collection of (intact) periodicals. See id., at 8 (\"The efficiency, accuracy, reliability, comprehensiveness and immediacy of access offered by searchable full-text digital archives are but a few of the benefits historians and other researches have reaped from the advancement in the technology of information\").~    ~    ~      73~      Because it is likely that Congress did not consider the question raised by this case when drafting 201(c), because I think the District Court's reading of that provision is reasonable and consistent with the statute's purposes, and because the principal goals of copyright policy are better served by that reading, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. The majority is correct that we cannot know in advance the effects of today's decision on the comprehensiveness of electronic databases. We can be fairly certain, however, that it will provide little, if any, benefit to either authors or readers.~    ~    ~      ~        NOTES:~      ~      ~        1~          Contractual attempts to assign such limited rights were deemed by courts to create mere licenses, such that the failure to accompany the article with an individual copyright in the author's name allowed the article to pass into the public domain. See 3 M. Nimmer  D. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright 10.01[A], p. 10-5; 10.01[C][2], p. 10-12 (2001).~      ~      ~        2~          Cf. Goodis v. United Artists Television, Inc., 425 F.2d 397 (CA2 1970) (creating a legal fiction in which the publisher to whom an author gave first publication rights was considered the legal owner of the author's copyright, which the publisher was deemed to hold in trust for the \"beneficial owner,\" the author).~      ~      ~        3~          \"Usually, publishers are perfectly willing to return copyright to the author, at least with respect to everything except enumerated serial or reprint rights. There have been allegations that smaller publishers sometimes believe that they are entitled to share in the subsidiary rights and refuse to reassign, or insist upon sharing part of the profits of [the] sales to motion picture, television or dramatic users. In these cases, the author must undertake the burden of proving his contract with the publisher and demonstrating his capacity to sue.\" Kaminstein 21.~      ~      ~        4~          Respondents Garson and Robbins argue that the 201(c) privilege is completely nontransferable. See Brief for Respondents Garson et al. 26-29. The District Court properly rejected this argument, see 972 F. Supp. 804, 815-816 (SDNY 1997), which, in my view, is supported by neither the text nor the legislative history of 201(c). Publishers obviously cannot assign their publication privilege to another publisher such that the author's work appears in a wholly different collective work, but nothing in 201(c) clearly prohibits a publisher from merely farming out the mundane task of printing or distributing its collective work or its revision of that collective work. Because neither the majority nor the Court of Appeals has reached this issue, however, see ante, at 7; 206 F.3d 161, 165, and n. 2 (CA2 2000), I will not address it further.~      ~      ~        5~          As the District Court observed, representatives of authors had objected to an earlier draft of the 1976 Act that might have been read to give publishers the right to change the text of the contributions. That version gave publishers the privilege to print the individual article \" 'as part of that particular collective work and any revisions of it.' \" 972 F. Supp., at 819. Harriet Pilpel, \"a prominent author representative,\" expressed the following concern: \"I have but one question with reference to the wording, and that is with respect to the wording at the end of subsection (c) '  and any revisions of it.' If that means 'any revision of the collective work' in terms of changing the contributions, or their order, or including different contributions, obviously the magazine writers and photographers would not object. But there is an implication, or at least an ambiguity, that somehow the owner of the collective work has a right to make revisions in the contributions to the collective work. This is not and should not be the law, and consequently I suggest that the wording at the end of subsection (c) be changed to make that absolutely clear.' \" 1964 Revision Bill with Discussions and Comments, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 5, p. 9 (H. Comm. Print 1965), quoted in 972 F. Supp., at 819.~      ~      ~        6~          Nor is the majority correct that, even if respondents retained copyright in their individual articles, the conclusion that petitioners could republish their collective works on the Electronic Databases would drain that copyright of value. See infra, at 17. Even on my view of this case, respondents retain substantial rights over their articles. Only the respondents, for example, could authorize the publication of their articles in different periodicals or in new topical anthologies wholly apart from the context of the original collective works in which their articles appeared.~      ~      ~        7~          ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a standard means for storing textual data. It assigns a unique binary code for each letter of the alphabet, as well as for numbers, punctuation, and other characters. It cannot be used to convey graphical information. See C. MacKenzie, Coded Character Sets: History and Development 211-213 (1980).~      ~      ~        8~          Substantially the same process was used by the other Print Publishers to prepare their files for electronic publication. App. 74a.~      ~      ~        9~          An ASCII version of the October 31, 2000, New York Times, which contains 287 articles, would fill over 500 printed pages. Conversely, in the case of graphical products like GPO, the demands that memory-intensive graphics files can place on underpowered computers make it appropriate for electronic publishers to divide the larger collective work into manageably sized subfiles. The individual article is the logical unit. The GPO version of the April 7, 1996, New York Times Magazine, for example, would demand in the neighborhood of 200 megabytes of memory if stored as a single file, whereas individual article files range from 4 to 22 megabytes, depending on the length of the article.~      ~      ~        10~          See Brief for Respondent Garson et al. 4-5, n. 3.~      ~      ~        11~          The majority's reliance on the fact that the GPO user cannot \"flip\" the page to see material published on other pages, ante, at 5, n. 2, and that the text database articles \"appear disconnected from their original context,\" ante, at 16, appears to be nothing more than a criticism of Electronic Databases' medium-driven decision to break down the periodicals it contains into smaller, less unwieldy article-units. See n. 9, supra.~      ~      ~        12~          \"The New York Times perhaps even represents the paradigm, the epitome of a publication in which selection alone reflects sufficient originality to merit copyright protection.\" 972 F. Supp., at 823.~      ~      ~        13~          In NEXIS, for example, the reader can gather all the content of the October 31, 2000, New York Times by conducting the following simple search in the correct \"library\": \"date(is 10/31/2000).\"~      ~      ~        14~          The majority finds that NEXIS infringes by \"cop[ying]\" and \"distribut[ing]\" copies of respondents' articles to the public. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that NEXIS makes it possible for users to make and distribute copies. In any event, the Court has wisely declined to reach the question whether the Electronic Databases publicly \"display\" the articles within the meaning of 106.

In the quarter century since the 1976 Act became law, \"the databases [in existence] have grown by a factor of 39   . In 1975, the 301 databases in existence contained about 52 million records. The 11,681 databases in 1999 contained nearly 12.86 billion records for a growth by a factor of 242.\" Williams, Highlights of the Online Database Industry and the Internet: 2000, in Proceedings of the 21st Annual National Online Meeting 1 (Williams ed., 2000).~      ~      ~        16~          But see Breyer, The Uneasy Case for Copyright: A Study of Copyright in Books, Photocopies, and Computer Programs, 84 Harv. L. Rev. 281, 286-290 (1970) (criticizing the use of copyright as a means of protecting authorial rights).~      ~      ~        17~          Indeed, today's decision in favor of authors may have the perverse consequence of encouraging publishers to demand from freelancers a complete transfer of copyright. If that turns out to be the case, we will have come full circle back to the pre-1976 situation.~      ~      ~        18~          If the problem is as important as amici contend, congressional action may ultimately be necessary to preserve present databases in their entirety. At the least, Congress can determine the nature and scope of the problem and fashion on appropriate licensing remedy far more easily than can courts. Compare 17 U.S.C.  108(d)(1).~      ~      ~        19~          It is important to remember that the prospect of payment by the Print Publishers was sufficient to stimulate each petitioner to create his or her part of the collective works, presumably with full awareness of its intended inclusion in the Electronic Databases.~      ~      ~        20~          Even assuming, as the majority does, see ante, at 12, n. 6, that the existence of databases like NEXIS may have some adverse effect on the market for stand-alone compilations of authors' contributions to collective works, I fail to see how, on that basis, electronic databases are any different from microform. With respect to effects on the market for stand-alone works, the only difference between the two products is the speed with which digital technology allows NEXIS users to retrieve the desired data. But the 1976 Act was not intended to bar the use of every conceivable innovation in technology that might \" 'give[] publishers [new] opportunities to exploit authors' works.' \" Ibid. Copyright law is not an insurance policy for authors, but a carefully struck balance between the need to create incentives for authorship and the interests of society in the broad accessibility of ideas. See U.S. Const., Art. I, 8, cl. 8 (in order to promote production, Congress should allow authors and inventors to enjoy \"exclusive Right[s],\" but only \"for limited Times\" (emphasis added)); see also supra, at 15. The majority's focus on authorial incentive comes at the expense of the equally important (at least from the perspective of copyright policy) public interest. Moreover, the majority's single-minded focus on \"authorial rights\" appears to lead it to believe that, because some authors may benefit from its decision, that decision must be the one intended by Congress. It cites the \" 'economic philosophy behind the [Copyright Clause]' \" as consistent with its view that Congress adjusted \"the author/publisher balance\" precisely to avoid the types of uses embodied in the Electronic Databases. See ante, at 9, n. 3. But, as I have already argued, see supra, at 14-15, there is no indication that Congress ever considered the issue presented in this case. It thus simply begs the question for the majority to argue that the right not to have a work included within the Electronic Databases is an \"authorial right\" that \"Congress [has] established,\" ante, at 21 (emphasis added), or that given Congress' failure clearly to address itself to the question a decision allowing such inclusion would amount to \"diminish[ing]\" authorial \"rights\" on the basis of \"our conception of their interests.\" Ante, at 12-13, n. 6 (emphasis added).~      ~    ~    ",

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.LORILLARD TOBACCO CO. et al.v.REILLY, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MASSACHUSETTS, et al.*~    No. 00-596.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued April 25, 2001Decided June 28, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      After the Attorney General of Massachusetts (Attorney General) promulgated comprehensive regulations governing the advertising and sale of cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and cigars, petitioners, a group of tobacco manufacturers and retailers, filed this suit asserting, among other things, the Supremacy Clause claim that the cigarette advertising regulations are pre-empted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (FCLAA), which prescribes mandatory health warnings for cigarette packaging and advertising, 15 U.S.C.  1333 and pre-empts similar state regulations, 1334(b); and a claim that the regulations violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution. In large measure, the District Court upheld the regulations. Among its rulings, the court held that restrictions on the location of advertising were not pre-empted by the FCLAA, and that neither the regulations prohibiting outdoor advertising within 1,000 feet of a school or playground nor the sales practices regulations restricting the location and distribution of tobacco products violated the First Amendment. The court ruled, however, that the point-of-sale advertising regulations requiring that indoor advertising be placed no lower than five feet from the floor were invalid because the Attorney General had not provided sufficient justification for that restriction. The First Circuit affirmed the District Court's rulings that the cigarette advertising regulations are not pre-empted by the FCLAA and that the outdoor advertising regulations and the sales practices regulations do not violate the First Amendment under Central Hudson Gas  Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U.S. 557, but reversed the lower court's invalidation of the point-of-sale advertising regulations, concluding that the Attorney General is better suited than courts to determine what restrictions are necessary.~      Held:   1. The FCLAA pre-empts Massachusetts' regulations governing outdoor and point-of-sale cigarette advertising. Pp. 9-23.~      (a) The FCLAA's pre-emption provision, 1334, prohibits (a) requiring cigarette packages to bear any \"statement relating to smoking and health, other than the statement required by\" 1333, and (b) any \"requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health ... imposed under state law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with\" 1333. The Court's analysis begins with the statute's language. Hughes Aircraft Co. v. Jacobson, 525 U.S. 432, 438. The statute's interpretation is aided by considering the predecessor pre-emption provision and the context in which the current language was adopted. See, e.g., Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.S. 470, 486. The original provision simply prohibited any \"statement relating to smoking and health ... in the advertising of any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with the [Act's] provisions.\" Without question, the current pre-emption provision's plain language is much broader. Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc.,505 U.S. 504, 520. Rather than preventing only \"statements,\" the amended provision reaches all \"requirement[s] or prohibition[s] ... imposed under State law.\" And, although the former statute reached only statements \"in the advertising,\" the current provision governs \"with respect to the advertising or promotion\" of cigarettes. At the same time that Congress expanded the pre-emption provision with respect to the States, it enacted a provision prohibiting cigarette advertising in electronic media altogether. Pp. 10-15.~      (b) Congress pre-empted state cigarette advertising regulations like the Attorney General's because they would upset federal legislative choices to require specific warnings and to impose the ban on cigarette advertising in electronic media in order to address concerns about smoking and health. In holding that the FCLAA does not nullify the Massachusetts regulations, the First Circuit concentrated on whether they are \"with respect to\" advertising and promotion, concluding that the FCLAA only pre-empts regulations of the content of cigarette advertising. The court also reasoned that the regulations are a form of zoning, a traditional area of state power, and, therefore, a presumption against pre-emption applied, see California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham Constr., N. A., Inc., 519 U.S. 316, 325. This Court rejects the notion that the regulations are not \"with respect to\" cigarette advertising and promotion. There is no question about an indirect relationship between the Massachusetts regulations and cigarette advertising: The regulations expressly target such advertising. Id., at 324-325. The Attorney General's argument that the regulations are not \"based on smoking and health\" since they do not involve health-related content, but instead target youth exposure to cigarette advertising, is unpersuasive because, at bottom, the youth exposure concern is intertwined with the smoking and health concern. Also unavailing is the Attorney General's claim that the regulations are not pre-empted because they govern the location, not the content, of cigarette advertising. The content/location distinction cannot be squared with the pre-emption provision's language, which reaches all \"requirements\" and \"prohibitions\" \"imposed under State law.\" A distinction between advertising content and location in the FCLAA also cannot be reconciled with Congress' own location-based restriction, which bans advertising in electronic media, but not elsewhere. The Attorney General's assertion that a complete state ban on cigarette advertising would not be pre-empted because Congress did not intend to preclude local control of zoning finds no support in the FCLAA, whose comprehensive warnings, advertising restrictions, and pre-emption provision would make little sense if a State or locality could simply target and ban all cigarette advertising. Pp. 15-21.~      (c) The FCLAA's pre-emption provision does not restrict States' and localities' ability to enact generally applicable zoning restrictions on the location and size of advertisements that apply to cigarettes on equal terms with other products, see, e.g., Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U.S. 490, 507-508, or to regulate conduct as it relates to the sale or use of cigarettes, as by prohibiting cigarette sales to minors, see 42 U.S.C.  300x-26(a)(1), 300x-21, as well as common inchoate offenses that attach to criminal conduct, such as solicitation, conspiracy, and attempt, cf. Central Hudson, supra, at 563-564. Pp. 21-22.~      (d) Because the issue was not decided below, the Court declines to reach the smokeless tobacco petitioners' argument that, if the outdoor and point-of-sale advertising regulations for cigarettes are pre-empted, then the same regulations for smokeless tobacco must be invalidated because they cannot be severed from the cigarette provisions. Pp. 22-23.~      2. Massachusetts' outdoor and point-of-sale advertising regulations relating to smokeless tobacco and cigars violate the First Amendment, but the sales practices regulations relating to all three tobacco products are constitutional. Pp. 23-41.~      (a) Under Central Hudson's four-part test for analyzing regulations of commercial speech, the Court must determine (1) whether the expression is protected by the First Amendment, (2) whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial, (3) whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted, and (4) whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest. 447 U.S., at 566. Only the last two steps are at issue here. The Attorney General has assumed for summary judgment purposes that the First Amendment protects the speech of petitioners, none of whom contests the importance of the State's interest in preventing the use of tobacco by minors. The third step of Central Hudson requires that the government demonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree. Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U.S. 761, 770-771. The fourth step of Central Hudson requires a reasonable fit between the legislature's ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends, a means narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective. E.g., Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U.S. 618, 632. Pp. 23-26.~      (b) The outdoor advertising regulations prohibiting smokeless tobacco or cigar advertising within 1,000 feet of a school or playground violate the First Amendment. Pp. 26-38.~      (1) Those regulations satisfy Central Hudson's third step by directly advancing the governmental interest asserted to justify them. The Court's detailed review of the record reveals that the Attorney General has provided ample documentation of the problem with underage use of smokeless tobacco and cigars. In addition, the Court disagrees with petitioners' claim that there is no evidence that preventing targeted advertising campaigns and limiting youth exposure to advertising will decrease underage use of those products. On the record below and in the posture of summary judgment, it cannot be concluded that the Attorney General's decision to regulate smokeless tobacco and cigar advertising in an effort to combat the use of tobacco products by minors was based on mere \"speculation and conjecture.\" Edenfield, supra, at 770. Pp. 26-31.~      (2) Whatever the strength of the Attorney General's evidence to justify the outdoor advertising regulations, however, the regulations do not satisfy Central Hudson's fourth step. Their broad sweep indicates that the Attorney General did not \"carefully calculat[e] the costs and benefits associated with the burden on speech imposed.\" Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U.S. 410, 417. The record indicates that the regulations prohibit advertising in a substantial portion of Massachusetts' major metropolitan areas; in some areas, they would constitute nearly a complete ban on the communication of truthful information. This substantial geographical reach is compounded by other factors. \"Outdoor\" advertising includes not only advertising located outside an establishment, but also advertising inside a store if visible from outside. Moreover, the regulations restrict advertisements of any size, and the term advertisement also includes oral statements. The uniformly broad sweep of the geographical limitation and the range of communications restricted demonstrate a lack of tailoring. The governmental interest in preventing underage tobacco use is substantial, and even compelling, but it is no less true that the sale and use of tobacco products by adults is a legal activity. A speech regulation cannot unduly impinge on the speaker's ability to propose a commercial transaction and the adult listener's opportunity to obtain information about products. The Attorney General has failed to show that the regulations at issue are not more extensive than necessary. Pp. 31-36.~      (c) The regulations prohibiting indoor, point-of-sale advertising of smokeless tobacco and cigars lower than 5 feet from the floor of a retail establishment located within 1,000 feet of a school or playground fail both the third and fourth steps of the Central Hudson analysis. The 5-foot rule does not seem to advance the goals of preventing minors from using tobacco products and curbing demand for that activity by limiting youth exposure to advertising. Not all children are less than 5 feet tall, and those who are can look up and take in their surroundings. Nor can the blanket height restriction be construed as a mere regulation of communicative action under United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, since it is not unrelated to expression, see, e.g., Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 403, but attempts to regulate directly the communicative impact of indoor advertising. Moreover, the restriction does not constitute a reasonable fit with the goal of targeting tobacco advertising that entices children. Although the First Circuit decided that the restriction's burden on speech is very limited, there is no de minimis exception for a speech restriction that lacks sufficient tailoring or justification. Pp. 36-38.~      (d) Assuming that petitioners have a cognizable speech interest in a particular means of displaying their products, cf. Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U.S. 410, the regulations requiring retailers to place tobacco products behind counters and requiring customers to have contact with a salesperson before they are able to handle such a product withstand First Amendment scrutiny. The State has demonstrated a substantial interest in preventing access to tobacco products by minors and has adopted an appropriately narrow means of advancing that interest. See e.g., O'Brien, supra, at 382. Because unattended displays of such products present an opportunity for access without the proper age verification required by law, the State prohibits self-service and other displays that would allow an individual to obtain tobacco without direct contact with a salesperson. It is clear that the regulations leave open ample communication channels. They do not significantly impede adult access to tobacco products, and retailers have other means of exercising any cognizable speech interest in the presentation of their products. The Court presumes that vendors may place empty tobacco packaging on open display, and display actual tobacco products so long as that display is only accessible to sales personnel. As for cigars, there is no indication that a customer is unable to examine a cigar prior to purchase, so long as that examination takes place through a salesperson. Pp. 38-40.~      (e) The Court declines to address the cigar petitioners' First Amendment challenge to a regulation prohibiting sampling or promotional giveaways of cigars and little cigars. That claim was not sufficiently briefed and argued before this Court. Pp. 40-41. 218 F.3d 30, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.~      ON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT~      nllfotNotes:~      ~        ~          *~           Together with No. 00-597, Altadis U.S. A. Inc., as Successor to Consolidated Cigar Corp. and Havatampa, Inc., et al. v. Reilly, Attorney General of Massachusetts, et al., also on certiorari to the same court.~        ~      ~      O'Connor, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, Parts I, II-C, and II-D of which were unanimous; Parts III-A, III-C, and III-D of which were joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, and Thomas, JJ.; Part III-B-1 of which was joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ.; and Parts II-A, II-B, III-B-2, and IV of which were joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      In January 1999, the Attorney General of Massachusetts promulgated comprehensive regulations governing the advertising and sale of cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and cigars. 940 Code of Mass. Regs. 21.01-21.07, 22.01-22.09 (2000). Petitioners, a group of cigarette, smokeless tobacco, and cigar manufacturers and retailers, filed suit in Federal District Court claiming that the regulations violate federal law and the United States Constitution. In large measure, the District Court determined that the regulations are valid and enforceable. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, concluding that the regulations are not pre-empted by federal law and do not violate the First Amendment. The first question presented for our review is whether certain cigarette advertising regulations are pre-empted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (FCLAA), 79 Stat. 282, as amended, 15 U.S.C.  1331 et seq. The second question presented is whether certain regulations governing the advertising and sale of tobacco products violate the First Amendment.~    ~    ~      2~      * In November 1998, Massachusetts, along with over 40 other States, reached a landmark agreement with major manufacturers in the cigarette industry. The signatory States settled their claims against these companies in exchange for monetary payments and permanent injunctive relief. See App. 253-258 (Outline of Terms for Massachusetts in National Tobacco Settlement); Master Settlement Agreement (Nov. 23, 1998), http://www.naag.org. At the press conference covering Massachusetts' decision to sign the agreement, then-Attorney General Scott Harshbarger announced that as one of his last acts in office, he would create consumer protection regulations to restrict advertising and sales practices for tobacco products. He explained that the regulations were necessary in order to \"close holes\" in the settlement agreement and \"to stop Big Tobacco from recruiting new customers among the children of Massachusetts.\" App. 251.~    ~    ~      3~      In January 1999, pursuant to his authority to prevent unfair or deceptive practices in trade, Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 93A, 2 (1997), the Massachusetts Attorney General (Attorney General) promulgated regulations governing the sale and advertisement of cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and cigars. The purpose of the cigarette and smokeless tobacco regulations is \"to eliminate deception and unfairness in the way cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products are marketed, sold and distributed in Massachusetts in order to address the incidence of cigarette smoking and smokeless tobacco use by children under legal age .... [and] in order to prevent access to such products by underage consumers.\" 940 Code of Mass. Regs. 21.01 (2000). The similar purpose of the cigar regulations is \"to eliminate deception and unfairness in the way cigars and little cigars are packaged, marketed, sold and distributed in Massachusetts [so that] ... consumers may be adequately informed about the health risks associated with cigar smoking, its addictive properties, and the false perception that cigars are a safe alternative to cigarettes ... [and so that] the incidence of cigar use by children under legal age is addressed ... in order to prevent access to such products by underage consumers.\" Ibid. The regulations have a broader scope than the master settlement agreement, reaching advertising, sales practices, and members of the tobacco industry not covered by the agreement. The regulations place a variety of restrictions on outdoor advertising, point-of-sale advertising, retail sales transactions, transactions by mail, promotions, sampling of products, and labels for cigars.~    ~    ~      4~      The cigarette and smokeless tobacco regulations being challenged before this Court provide:~    ~    ~      5~      \"(2) Retail Outlet Sales Practices. Except as otherwise provided in [21.04(4)], it shall be an unfair or deceptive act or practice for any person who sells or distributes cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products through a retail outlet located within Massachusetts to engage in any of the following retail outlet sales practices:~    ~    ~      6~      . . . . .~    ~    ~      7~      \"(c) Using self-service displays of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products;~    ~    ~      8~      \"(d) Failing to place cigarettes and smokeless to- bacco products out of the reach of all consumers, and in a location accessible only to outlet personnel.\" 21.04(2)(c)-(d).~    ~    ~      9~      \"(5) Advertising Restrictions.

The cigar regulations that are still at issue provide:~    ~    ~      12~      \"(1) Retail Sales Practices. Except as otherwise provided in [22.06(4)], it shall be an unfair or deceptive act or practice for any person who sells or distributes cigars or little cigars directly to consumers within Massachusetts to engage in any of the following practices:~    ~    ~      13~      \"(a) sampling of cigars or little cigars or promotional give-aways of cigars or little cigars.\" 21.06(1)(a).~    ~    ~      14~      \"(2) Retail Outlet Sales Practices.

This includes, without limitation, utilitarian items and permanent or semi-permanent fixtures with such indicia of product identification such as lighting fixtures, awnings, display cases, clocks and door mats, but does not include utilitarian items with a volume of 200 cubic inches or less.\" 21.03, 22.03.~    ~    ~      22~      Before the effective date of the regulations, February 1, 2000, members of the tobacco industry sued the Attorney General in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Four cigarette manufacturers (Lorillard Tobacco Company, Brown  Williamson Tobacco Corporation, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, and Philip Morris Incorporated), a maker of smokeless tobacco products (U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company), and several cigar manufacturers and retailers claimed that many of the regulations violate the Commerce Clause, the Supremacy Clause, the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and Rev. Stat. 1979, 42 U.S.C.  1983. The parties sought summary judgment. 76 F. Supp. 2d 124, 127 (1999); 84 F. Supp. 2d 180, 183 (2000).~    ~    ~      23~      In its first ruling, the District Court considered the Supremacy Clause claim that the FCLAA, 15 U.S.C.  1331 et seq., pre-empts the cigarette advertising regulations. 76 F. Supp. 2d, at 128-134. The FCLAA prescribes the health warnings that must appear on packaging and in advertisements for cigarettes. The FCLAA contains a pre-emption provision that prohibits a State from imposing any \"requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health ... with respect to the advertising or promotion of ... cigarettes.\" 1334(b). The FCLAA's pre-emption provision does not cover smokeless tobacco or cigars.~    ~    ~      24~      The District Court explained that the central question for purposes of pre-emption is whether the regulations create a predicate legal duty based on smoking and health. The court reasoned that to read the pre-emption provision to proscribe any state advertising regulation enacted due to health concerns about smoking would expand Congress' purpose beyond a reasonable scope and leave States powerless to regulate in the area. The court concluded that restrictions on the location of advertising are not based on smoking and health and thus are not pre-empted by the FCLAA. The District Court also concluded that a provision that permitted retailers to display a black and white \"tombstone\" sign reading \"Tobacco Products Sold Here,\" 940 Code of Mass. Regs. 21.04(6) (2000), was pre-empted by the FCLAA.~    ~    ~      25~      In a separate ruling, the District Court considered the claim that the Attorney General's regulations violate the First Amendment. 84 F. Supp. 2d, at 183-196. Rejecting petitioners' argument that strict scrutiny should apply, the court applied the four-part test of Central Hudson Gas  Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U.S. 557 (1980), for commercial speech. The court reasoned that the Attorney General had provided an adequate basis for regulating cigars and smokeless tobacco as well as cigarettes because of the similarities among the products. The court held that the outdoor advertising regulations, which prohibit outdoor advertising within 1,000 feet of a school or playground, do not violate the First Amendment because they advance a substantial government interest and are narrowly tailored to suppress no more speech than necessary. The court concluded that the sales practices regulations, which restrict the location and distribution of tobacco products, survive scrutiny because they do not implicate a significant speech interest. The court invalidated the point-of-sale advertising regulations, which require that indoor advertising be placed no lower than five feet from the floor, finding that the Attorney General had not provided sufficient justification for that restriction. The District Court's ruling with respect to the cigar warning requirements and the Commerce Clause is not before this Court.~    ~    ~      26~      The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit issued a stay pending appeal, App. 8-9, and affirmed in part and reversed in part the District Court's judgment, Consolidated Cigar Corp. v. Reilly, 218 F.3d 30 (2000). With respect to the Supremacy Clause, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's ruling that the Attorney General's cigarette advertising regulations are not pre-empted by the FCLAA. The First Circuit was persuaded by the reasoning of the Second and Seventh Circuits, which had concluded that the FCLAA's pre-emption provision is ambiguous, and held that the provision pre-empts regulations of the content, but not the location, of cigarette advertising. See Greater New York Metropolitan Food Council, Inc. v. Giuliani, 195 F.3d 100, 104-110 (CA2 1999); Federation of Advertising Industry Representatives, Inc. v. Chicago, 189 F.3d 633, 636-640 (CA7 1999).~    ~    ~      27~      With respect to the First Amendment, the Court of Appeals applied the Central Hudson test. 447 U.S. 557 (1980). The court held that the outdoor advertising regulations do not violate the First Amendment. The court concluded that the restriction on outdoor advertising within 1,000 feet of a school or playground directly advances the State's substantial interest in preventing tobacco use by minors. The court also found that the outdoor advertising regulations restrict no more speech than necessary, reasoning that the distance chosen by the Attorney General is the sort of determination better suited for legislative and executive decisionmakers than courts. The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's invalidation of the point-of-sale advertising regulations, again concluding that the Attorney General is better suited to determine what restrictions are necessary. The Court of Appeals also held that the sales practices regulations are valid under the First Amendment. The court found that the regulations directly advance the State's interest in preventing minors' access to tobacco products and that the regulations are narrowly tailored because retailers have a variety of other means to present the packaging of their products and to allow customers to examine the products.~    ~    ~      28~      As for the argument that smokeless tobacco and cigars are different from cigarettes, the court expressed some misgivings about equating all tobacco products, but ultimately decided that the Attorney General had presented sufficient evidence with respect to all three products to regulate them similarly. The Court of Appeals' decision with respect to the cigar warning requirements and the Commerce Clause is not before this Court.~    ~    ~      29~      The Court of Appeals stayed its mandate pending disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari. App. 13. The cigarette manufacturers and U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company filed a petition, challenging the Court of Appeals' decision with respect to the outdoor and point-of-sale advertising regulations on pre-emption and First Amendment grounds, and the sales practices regulations on First Amendment grounds. The cigar companies filed a separate petition, again raising a First Amendment challenge to the outdoor advertising, point-of-sale advertising, and sales practices regulations. We granted both petitions, 531 U.S. 1068 (2001), to resolve the conflict among the Courts of Appeals with respect to whether the FCLAA pre-empts cigarette advertising regulations like those at issue here, cf. Lindsey v. Tacoma-Pierce County Health Dept., 195 F.3d 1065 (CA9 1999), and to decide the important First Amendment issues presented in these cases.~    ~    II~    ~      30~      Before reaching the First Amendment issues, we must decide to what extent federal law pre-empts the Attorney General's regulations. The cigarette petitioners contend that the FCLAA, 15 U.S.C.  1331 et seq., pre-empts the Attorney General's cigarette advertising regulations.~    ~    ~      31~      * Article VI of the United States Constitution commands that the laws of the United States \"shall be the supreme Law of the Land; ... any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\" Art. VI, cl. 2. See also McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 427 (1819) (\"It is of the very essence of supremacy, to remove all obstacles to its action within its own sphere, and so to modify every power vested in subordinate governments\"). This relatively clear and simple mandate has generated considerable discussion in cases where we have had to discern whether Congress has pre-empted state action in a particular area. State action may be foreclosed by express language in a congressional enactment, see, e.g., Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U.S. 504, 517 (1992), by implication from the depth and breadth of a congressional scheme that occupies the legislative field, see, e.g., Fidelity Fed. Sav.  Loan Assn. v. De la Cuesta, 458 U.S. 141, 153 (1982), or by implication because of a conflict with a congressional enactment, see, e.g., Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U.S. 861, 869-874 (2000).~    ~    ~      32~      In the FCLAA, Congress has crafted a comprehensive federal scheme governing the advertising and promotion of cigarettes. The FCLAA's pre-emption provision provides:~    ~    ~      33~      \"(a) Additional statements~    ~    ~      34~      \"No statement relating to smoking and health, other than the statement required by section 1333 of this title, shall be required on any cigarette package.~    ~    ~      35~      \"(b) State regulations~    ~    ~      36~      \"No requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under State law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.\" 15 U.S.C.  1334. The FCLAA's pre-emption provision does not cover smokeless tobacco or cigars.~    ~    ~      37~      In this case, our task is to identify the domain expressly pre-empted, see Cipollone, supra, at 517, because \"an express definition of the pre-emptive reach of a statute . . . supports a reasonable inference ... that Congress did not intend to pre-empt other matters,\" Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick, 514 U.S. 280, 288 (1995). Congressional purpose is the \"ultimate touchstone\" of our inquiry. Cipollone, supra, at 516 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because \"federal law is said to bar state action in [a] fiel[d] of traditional state regulation,\" namely, advertising, see Packer Corp. v. Utah, 285 U.S. 105, 108 (1932), we \"wor[k] on the assumption that the historic police powers of the States [a]re not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that [is] the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\" California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham Constr., N. A., Inc., 519 U.S. 316, 325 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). See also Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.S. 470, 475 (1996).~    ~    ~      38~      Our analysis begins with the language of the statute. Hughes Aircraft Co. v. Jacobson, 525 U.S. 432, 438 (1999). In the pre-emption provision, Congress unequivocally precludes the requirement of any additional statements on cigarette packages beyond those provided in 1333. 15 U.S.C.  1334(a). Congress further precludes States or localities from imposing any requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health with respect to the advertising and promotion of cigarettes. 1334(b). Without question, the second clause is more expansive than the first; it employs far more sweeping language to describe the state action that is pre-empted. We must give meaning to each element of the pre-emption provision. We are aided in our interpretation by considering the predecessor pre-emption provision and the circumstances in which the current language was adopted. See Medtronic, supra, at 486; McCarthy v. Bronson, 500 U.S. 136, 139 (1991); K mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 U.S. 281, 291 (1988).~    ~    ~      39~      In 1964, the groundbreaking Report of the Surgeon General's Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health concluded that \"[c]igarette smoking is a health hazard of sufficient importance in the United States to warrant appropriate remedial action.\" Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, U.S. Surgeon General's Advisory Committee, Smoking and Health 33. In 1965, Congress enacted the FCLAA as a proactive measure in the face of impending regulation by federal agencies and the States. Pub. L. 89-92, 79 Stat. 282. See also Cipollone, supra, at 513-515. The purpose of the FCLAA was twofold: to inform the public adequately about the hazards of cigarette smoking, and to protect the national economy from interference due to diverse, nonuniform, and confusing cigarette labeling and advertising regulations with respect to the relationship between smoking and health. Pub. L. 89-92, 2. The FCLAA prescribed a label for cigarette packages: \"Caution: Cigarette Smoking May Be Hazardous to Your Health.\" 4. The FCLAA also required the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to report annually to Congress about the health consequences of smoking and the advertising and promotion of cigarettes. 5.~    ~    ~      40~      Section 5 of the FCLAA included a pre-emption provision in which \"Congress spoke precisely and narrowly.\" Cipollone, supra, at 518. Subsection 5(a) prohibited any requirement of additional statements on cigarette packaging. Subsection 5(b) provided that \"[n]o statement relating to smoking and health shall be required in the advertising of any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of this Act.\" Section 10 of the FCLAA set a termination date of July 1, 1969 for these provisions. As we have previously explained, \"on their face, [the pre-emption] provisions merely prohibited state and federal rulemaking bodies from mandating particular cautionary statements on cigarette labels [subsection (a)] or in cigarette advertisements [subsection (b)].\" Cipollone, 505 U.S., at 518.~    ~    ~      41~      The FCLAA was enacted with the expectation that Congress would reexamine it in 1969 in light of the developing information about cigarette smoking and health. H. R. Rep. No. 586, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 6 (1965); 111 Cong. Rec. 16541 (1965). In the intervening years, Congress received reports and recommendations from the HEW Secretary and the FTC. S. Rep. No. 91-566, pp. 2-6 (1969). The HEW Secretary recommended that Congress strengthen the warning, require the warning on all packages and in advertisements, and publish tar and nicotine levels on packages and in advertisements. Id., at 4. The FTC made similar and additional recommendations. The FTC sought a complete ban on radio and television advertising, a requirement that broadcasters devote time for health hazard announcements concerning smoking, and increased funding for public education and research about smoking. Id., at 6. The FTC urged Congress not to continue to prevent federal agencies from regulating cigarette advertising. Id., at 10. In addition, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had concluded that advertising which promoted the use of cigarettes created a duty in broadcast stations to provide information about the hazards of cigarette smoking. Id., at 6-7.~    ~    ~      42~      In 1969, House and Senate committees held hearings about the health effects of cigarette smoking and advertising by the cigarette industry. The bill that emerged from the House of Representatives strengthened the warning and maintained the pre-emption provision. The Senate amended that bill, adding the ban on radio and television advertising, and changing the pre-emption language to its present form. H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 91-897, pp. 4-5 (1970).~    ~    ~      43~      The final result was the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969, in which Congress, following the Senate's amendments, made three significant changes to the FCLAA. Pub. L. 91-222, 2, 84 Stat. 87. First, Congress drafted a new label that read: \"Warning: The Surgeon General Has Determined That Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous to Your Health.\" FCLAA, 4. Second, Congress declared it unlawful to advertise cigarettes on any medium of electronic communication subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC. 6. Finally, Congress enacted the current pre-emption provision, which proscribes any \"requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health ... imposed under State law with respect to the advertising or promotion\" of cigarettes. 5(b). The new subsection 5(b) did not pre-empt regulation by federal agencies, freeing the FTC to impose warning requirements in cigarette advertising. See Cipollone, supra, at 515. The new pre-emption provision, like its predecessor, only applied to cigarettes, and not other tobacco products.~    ~    ~      44~      In 1984, Congress again amended the FCLAA in the Comprehensive Smoking Education Act. Pub. L. 98-474, 98 Stat. 2200. The purpose of the Act was to \"provide a new strategy for making Americans more aware of any adverse health effects of smoking, to assure the timely and widespread dissemination of research findings and to enable individuals to make informed decisions about smoking.\" 2. The Act established a series of warnings to appear on a rotating basis on cigarette packages and in cigarette advertising, 4, and directed the Health and Human Services Secretary to create and implement an educational program about the health effects of cigarette smoking, 3.~    ~    ~      45~      The FTC has continued to report on trade practices in the cigarette industry. In 1999, the first year since the master settlement agreement, the FTC reported that the cigarette industry expended $8.24 billion on advertising and promotions, the largest expenditure ever. FTC, Cigarette Report for 1999, p. 1 (2000). Substantial increases were found in point-of-sale promotions, payments made to retailers to facilitate sales, and retail offers such as buy one, get one free, or product giveaways. Id., at 4-5. Substantial decreases, however, were reported for outdoor advertising and transit advertising. Id., at 2. Congress and federal agencies continue to monitor advertising and promotion practices in the cigarette industry.~    ~    ~      46~      The scope and meaning of the current pre-emption provision become clearer once we consider the original pre-emption language and the amendments to the FCLAA. Without question, \"the plain language of the pre-emption provision in the 1969 Act is much broader.\" Cipollone, 505 U.S., at 520. Rather than preventing only \"statements,\" the amended provision reaches all \"requirement[s] or prohibition[s] ... imposed under State law.\" And, although the former statute reached only statements \"in the advertising,\" the current provision governs \"with respect to the advertising or promotion\" of cigarettes. See ibid. Congress expanded the pre-emption provision with respect to the States, and at the same time, it allowed the FTC to regulate cigarette advertising. Congress also prohibited cigarette advertising in electronic media altogether. Viewed in light of the context in which the current pre-emption provision was adopted, we must determine whether the FCLAA pre-empts Massachusetts' regula- tions governing outdoor and point-of-sale advertising of cigarettes.~    ~    B~    ~      47~      The Court of Appeals acknowledged that the FCLAA pre-empts any \"requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health ... with respect to the advertising or promotion of ... cigarettes,\" 15 U.S.C.  1334(b), but concluded that the FCLAA does not nullify Massachusetts' cigarette advertising regulations. The court concentrated its analysis on whether the regulations are \"with respect to\" advertising and promotion, relying on two of its sister Circuits to conclude that the FCLAA only pre-empts regulations of the content of cigarette advertising. The Court of Appeals also reasoned that the Attorney General's regulations are a form of zoning, a traditional area of state power; therefore the presumption against pre-emption applied.~    ~    ~      48~      The cigarette petitioners maintain that the Court of Appeals' \"with respect to\" analysis is inconsistent with the FCLAA's statutory text and legislative history, and gives the States license to prohibit almost all cigarette advertising. Petitioners also maintain that there is no basis for construing the pre-emption provision to prohibit only content-based advertising regulations.~    ~    ~      49~      Although they support the Court of Appeals' result, the Attorney General and United States as amicus curiae do not fully endorse that court's textual analysis of the pre-emption provision. Instead, they assert that the cigarette advertising regulations are not pre-empted because they are not \"based on smoking and health.\" The Attorney General and the United States also contend that the regulations are not pre-empted because they do not prescribe the content of cigarette advertising and they fall squarely within the State's traditional powers to control the location of advertising and to protect the welfare of children.~    ~    ~      50~      Turning first to the language in the pre-emption provision relied upon by the Court of Appeals, we reject the notion that the Attorney General's cigarette advertising regulations are not \"with respect to\" advertising and promotion. We disagree with the Court of Appeals' analogy to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). In some cases concerning ERISA's pre-emption of state law, the Court has had to decide whether a particular state law \"relates to\" an employee benefit plan covered by ERISA even though the state law makes no express reference to such a plan. See, e.g., California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham Constr., N. A., Inc., 519 U.S., at 324-325. Here, however, there is no question about an indirect relationship between the regulations and cigarette advertising because the regulations expressly target cigarette advertising. 940 Code of Mass. Regs. 21.04(5) (2000).~    ~    ~      51~      Before this Court, the Attorney General focuses on a different phrase in the pre-emption provision: \"based on smoking and health.\" The Attorney General argues that the cigarette advertising regulations are not \"based on smoking and health,\" because they do not involve health-related content in cigarette advertising but instead target youth exposure to cigarette advertising. To be sure, Members of this Court have debated the precise meaning of \"based on smoking and health,\" see Cipollone, supra, at 529, n. 7 (plurality opinion), but we cannot agree with the Attorney General's narrow construction of the phrase.~    ~    ~      52~      As Congress enacted the current pre-emption provision, Congress did not concern itself solely with health warnings for cigarettes. In the 1969 amendments, Congress not only enhanced its scheme to warn the public about the hazards of cigarette smoking, but also sought to protect the public, including youth, from being inundated with images of cigarette smoking in advertising. In pursuit of the latter goal, Congress banned electronic media advertising of cigarettes. And to the extent that Congress contemplated additional targeted regulation of cigarette advertising, it vested that authority in the FTC.~    ~    ~      53~      The context in which Congress crafted the current pre-emption provision leads us to conclude that Congress prohibited state cigarette advertising regulations motivated by concerns about smoking and health. Massachusetts has attempted to address the incidence of underage cigarette smoking by regulating advertising, see 940 Code of Mass. Regs. 21.01 (2000), much like Congress' ban on cigarette advertising in electronic media. At bottom, the concern about youth exposure to cigarette advertising is intertwined with the concern about cigarette smoking and health. Thus the Attorney General's attempt to distinguish one concern from the other must be rejected.~    ~    ~      54~      The Attorney General next claims that the State's outdoor and point-of-sale advertising regulations for cigarettes are not pre-empted because they govern the location, and not the content, of advertising. This is also Justice Stevens' main point with respect to pre-emption. Post, at 6 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).~    ~    ~      55~      The content versus location distinction has some surface appeal. The pre-emption provision immediately follows the section of the FCLAA that prescribes warnings. See 15 U.S.C.  1333 1334. The pre-emption provision itself refers to cigarettes \"labeled in conformity with\" the statute. 1334(b). But the content/location distinction cannot be squared with the language of the pre-emption provision, which reaches all \"requirements\" and \"prohibitions\" \"imposed under State law.\" A distinction between the content of advertising and the location of advertising in the FCLAA also cannot be reconciled with Congress' own location-based restriction, which bans advertising in electronic media, but not elsewhere. See 1335. We are not at liberty to pick and choose which provisions in the legislative scheme we will consider, see post, at 7, n. 5 (opinion of Stevens, J.), but must examine the FCLAA as a whole.~    ~    ~      56~      Moreover, any distinction between the content and location of cigarette advertising collapses once the implications of that approach are fully considered. At oral argument, the Attorney General was pressed to explain what types of state regulations of cigarette advertising, in his view, are pre-empted by the FCLAA. The Attorney General maintained that a state law that required cigarette retailers to remove the word \"tobacco\" from advertisements, or required cigarette billboards to be blank, would be pre-empted if it were a regulation of \"health-related content.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 41, 42. The Attorney General also maintained, however, that a complete ban on all cigarette advertising would not be pre-empted because Congress did not intend to invade local control over zoning. Id., at 42-44. The latter position clearly follows from the factual distinction between content and location, but it finds no support in the text of the FCLAA's pre-emption provision. We believe that Congress wished to ensure that \"a State could not do through negative mandate (e.g., banning all cigarette advertising) that which it already was forbidden to do through positive mandate (e.g., mandating particular cautionary statements).\" Cipollone, 505 U.S., at 539 (Blackmun, J., joined by Kennedy and Souter, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part). See also Vango Media, Inc. v. New York, 34 F. 3d 68 (CA2 1994) (holding pre-empted a regulation that required one public health message for every four cigarette advertisements).~    ~    ~      57~      Justice Stevens, post, at 6-10, maintains that Congress did not intend to displace state regulation of the location of cigarette advertising. There is a critical distinction, however, between generally applicable zoning regulations, see infra, at 21-22, and regulations targeting cigarette advertising. The latter type of regulation, which is inevitably motivated by concerns about smoking and health, squarely contradicts the FCLAA. The FCLAA's comprehensive warnings, advertising restrictions, and pre-emption provision would make little sense if a State or locality could simply target and ban all cigarette advertising.~    ~    ~      58~      Justice Stevens finds it ironic that we conclude that \"federal law precludes States and localities from protecting children from dangerous products within 1,000 feet of a school,\" in light of our prior conclusion that the \"Federal Government lacks the constitutional authority to impose a similarly-motivated ban\" in United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995). Post, at 10, n. 8. Our holding is not as broad as the dissent states; we hold only that the FCLAA pre-empts state regulations targeting cigarette advertising. States remain free to enact generally applicable zoning regulations, and to regulate conduct with respect to cigarette use and sales. Infra, at 21-22. The reference to Lopez is also inapposite. In Lopez, we held that Congress exceeded the limits of its Commerce Clause power in the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, which made it a federal crime to possess a firearm in a school zone. 514 U.S., at 553-568. This case, by contrast, concerns the Supremacy Clause and the doctrine of pre-emption as applied in a case where Congress expressly precluded certain state regulations of cigarette advertising. Massachusetts did not raise a constitutional challenge to the FCLAA, and we are not confronted with whether Congress exceeded its constitutionally delegated authority in enacting the FCLAA.~    ~    ~      59~      In sum, we fail to see how the FCLAA and its pre-emption provision permit a distinction between the specific concern about minors and cigarette advertising and the more general concern about smoking and health in cigarette advertising, especially in light of the fact that Congress crafted a legislative solution for those very concerns. We also conclude that a distinction between state regulation of the location as opposed to the content of cigarette advertising has no foundation in the text of the pre-emption provision. Congress pre-empted state cigarette advertising regulations like the Attorney General's because they would upset federal legislative choices to require specific warnings and to impose the ban on cigarette advertising in electronic media in order to address concerns about smoking and health. Accordingly, we hold that the Attorney General's outdoor and point-of-sale advertising regulations targeting cigarettes are pre-empted by the FCLAA.~    ~    C~    ~      60~      Although the FCLAA prevents States and localities from imposing special requirements or prohibitions \"based on smoking and health\" \"with respect to the advertising or promotion\" of cigarettes, that language still leaves significant power in the hands of States to impose generally applicable zoning regulations and to regulate conduct. As we noted in Cipollone, \"each phrase within [the provision] limits the universe of [state action] pre-empted by the statute.\" 505 U.S., at 524 (plurality opinion).~    ~    ~      61~      For instance, the FCLAA does not restrict a State or locality's ability to enact generally applicable zoning restrictions. We have recognized that state interests in traffic safety and esthetics may justify zoning regulations for advertising. See Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U.S. 490, 507-508 (1981). See also St. Louis Poster Advertising Co. v. St. Louis, 249 U.S. 269, 274 (1919); Thomas Cusack Co. v. Chicago, 242 U.S. 526, 529-531 (1917). Although Congress has taken into account the unique concerns about cigarette smoking and health in advertising, there is no indication that Congress intended to displace local community interests in general regulations of the location of billboards or large marquee advertising, or that Congress intended cigarette advertisers to be afforded special treatment in that regard. Restrictions on the location and size of advertisements that apply to cigarettes on equal terms with other products appear to be outside the ambit of the pre-emption provision. Such restrictions are not \"based on smoking and health.\"~    ~    ~      62~      The FCLAA also does not foreclose all state regulation of conduct as it relates to the sale or use of cigarettes. The FCLAA's pre-emption provision explicitly governs state regulations of \"advertising or promotion.\"* Accordingly, the FCLAA does not pre-empt state laws prohibiting cigarette sales to minors. To the contrary, there is an established congressional policy that supports such laws; Congress has required States to prohibit tobacco sales to minors as a condition of receiving federal block grant funding for substance abuse treatment activities. 106 Stat. 394, 388, 42 U.S.C.  300x-26(a)(1), 300x-21.~    ~    ~      63~      In Massachusetts, it is illegal to sell or distribute tobacco products to persons under the age of 18. Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 270, 6 (2000). Having prohibited the sale and distribution of tobacco products to minors, the State may prohibit common inchoate offenses that attach to criminal conduct, such as solicitation, conspiracy, and attempt. Cf. Central Hudson Gas  Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of New York, 447 U.S. 557, 563-564 (1980); Carey v. Population Servs. Int'l, 431 U.S. 678, 701 (1977); Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 748, 772 (1976); 60 Fed. Reg. 41330-41332 (1995) (citing evidence that industry may be attempting to induce individuals under 18 to smoke cigarettes). States and localities also have at their disposal other means of regulating conduct to ensure that minors do not obtain cigarettes. See Part III-D, infra.~    ~    D~    ~      64~      The smokeless tobacco petitioners argue that if the State's outdoor and point-of-sale advertising regulations for cigarettes are pre-empted, then the same advertising regulations with respect to smokeless tobacco must be invalidated because they cannot be severed from the cigarette provisions. Brief for Petitioner U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Co. in Nos. 00-596 and 00-597, p. 4, n. 5. The District Court did not reach the severability issue with respect to the advertising provisions that are before this Court. 76 F. Supp. 2d, at 134, n. 11. The Court of Appeals also did not reach severability because that court likewise concluded that the cigarette advertising regulations were not pre-empted. 218 F.3d, at 37, n. 3. We decline to reach an issue that was not decided below. National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Smith, 525 U.S. 459, 470 (1999).~    ~    III~    ~      65~      By its terms, the FCLAA's pre-emption provision only applies to cigarettes. Accordingly, we must evaluate the smokeless tobacco and cigar petitioners' First Amendment challenges to the State's outdoor and point-of-sale advertising regulations. The cigarette petitioners did not raise a pre-emption challenge to the sales practices regulations. Thus, we must analyze the cigarette as well as the smokeless tobacco and cigar petitioners' claim that certain sales practices regulations for tobacco products violate the First Amendment.~    ~    ~      66~      * For over 25 years, the Court has recognized that commercial speech does not fall outside the purview of the First Amendment. See, e.g., Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, supra, at 762. Instead, the Court has afforded commercial speech a measure of First Amendment protection \" 'commensurate' \" with its position in relation to other constitutionally guaranteed expression. See, e.g., Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U.S. 618, 623 (1995) (quoting Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U.S. 469, 477 (1989)). In recognition of the \"distinction between speech proposing a commercial transaction, which occurs in an area traditionally subject to government regulation, and other varieties of speech,\" Central Hudson, supra, at 562 (internal quotation marks omitted), we developed a framework for analyzing regulations of commercial speech that is \"substantially similar\" to the test for time, place, and manner restrictions, Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, supra, at 477. The analysis contains four elements:~    ~    ~      67~      \"At the outset, we must determine whether the expression is protected by the First Amendment. For commercial speech to come within that provision, it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading. Next, we ask whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial. If both inquiries yield positive answers, we must determine whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted, and whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.\" Central Hudson, supra, at 566.~    ~    ~      68~      Petitioners urge us to reject the Central Hudson analysis and apply strict scrutiny. They are not the first litigants to do so. See, e.g., Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Assn., Inc. v. United States, 527 U.S. 173, 184 (1999). Admittedly, several Members of the Court have expressed doubts about the Central Hudson analysis and whether it should apply in particular cases. See, e.g., Greater New Orleans, supra, at 197 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U.S. 484, 501, 510-514 (1996) (joint opinion of Stevens, Kennedy, and Ginsburg, JJ.); id., at 517 (Scalia, J. concurring in part and concurring in judgment); id., at 518 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). But here, as in Greater New Orleans, we see \"no need to break new ground. Central Hudson, as applied in our more recent commercial speech cases, provides an adequate basis for decision.\" 527 U.S., at 184.~    ~    ~      69~      Only the last two steps of Central Hudson's four-part analysis are at issue here. The Attorney General has assumed for purposes of summary judgment that petitioners' speech is entitled to First Amendment protection. 218 F.3d., at 43; 84 F. Supp. 2d, at 185-186. With respect to the second step, none of the petitioners contests the importance of the State's interest in preventing the use of tobacco products by minors. Brief for Petitioners Lorillard Tobacco Co. et al. in No. 00-596, p. 41; Brief for Petitioner U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Co. in Nos. 00-596 and 00-597, at 16; Brief for Petitioners Altadis U.S. A. Inc. et al. in No. 00-597, p. 8.~    ~    ~      70~      The third step of Central Hudson concerns the relationship between the harm that underlies the State's interest and the means identified by the State to advance that interest. It requires that \"the speech restriction directly and materially advanc[e] the asserted governmental interest. 'This burden is not satisfied by mere speculation or conjecture; rather, a governmental body seeking to sustain a restriction on commercial speech must demonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree.' \" Greater New Orleans, supra, at 188 (quoting Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U.S. 761, 770-771 (1993)).~    ~    ~      71~      We do not, however, require that \"empirical data come ... accompanied by a surfeit of background information... [W]e have permitted litigants to justify speech restrictions by reference to studies and anecdotes pertaining to different locales altogether, or even, in a case applying strict scrutiny, to justify restrictions based solely on history, consensus, and 'simple common sense.' \" Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U.S., at 628 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).~    ~    ~      72~      The last step of the Central Hudson analysis \"complements\" the third step, \"asking whether the speech restriction is not more extensive than necessary to serve the interests that support it.\" Greater New Orleans, supra, at 188. We have made it clear that \"the least restrictive means\" is not the standard; instead, the case law requires a reasonable \" 'fit between the legislature's ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends, ... a means narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective.' \" Went For It, Inc., supra, at 632 (quoting Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U.S., at 480). Focusing on the third and fourth steps of the Central Hudson analysis, we first address the outdoor advertising and point-of-sale advertising regulations for smokeless tobacco and cigars. We then address the sales practices regulations for all tobacco products.~    ~    B~    ~      73~      The outdoor advertising regulations prohibit smokeless tobacco or cigar advertising within a 1,000-foot radius of a school or playground. 940 Code of Mass. Regs. 21.04(5)(a), 22.06(5)(a) (2000). The District Court and Court of Appeals concluded that the Attorney General had identified a real problem with underage use of tobacco products, that limiting youth exposure to advertising would combat that problem, and that the regulations burdened no more speech than necessary to accomplish the State's goal. 218 F.3d, at 44-53; 84 F. Supp. 2d, at 186-193. The smokeless tobacco and cigar petitioners take issue with all of these conclusions.~    ~    ~      74~      * The smokeless tobacco and cigar petitioners contend that the Attorney General's regulations do not satisfy Central Hudson's third step. They maintain that although the Attorney General may have identified a problem with underage cigarette smoking, he has not identified an equally severe problem with respect to underage use of smokeless tobacco or cigars. The smokeless tobacco petitioner emphasizes the \"lack of parity\" between cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. Brief for Petitioner U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Co. in Nos. 00-596 and 00-597, at 19; Reply Brief for Petitioner U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Co. in Nos. 00-596 and 00-597, pp. 4, 10-11. The cigar petitioners catalogue a list of differences between cigars and other tobacco products, including the characteristics of the products and marketing strategies. Brief for Petitioners Altadis U.S. A. Inc. et al. in No. 00-597, at 9-11. The petitioners finally contend that the Attorney General cannot prove that advertising has a causal link to tobacco use such that limiting advertising will materially alleviate any problem of underage use of their products. Brief for Petitioner U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Co. in Nos. 00-596 and 00-597, at 20-22; Brief for Petitioners Altadis U.S. A. Inc. et al. in No. 00-597, at 9-16.~    ~    ~      75~      In previous cases, we have acknowledged the theory that product advertising stimulates demand for products, while suppressed advertising may have the opposite effect. See Rubin, 514 U.S., at 487; United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co., 509 U.S. 418, 434 (1993); Central Hudson, 447 U.S., at 568-569. The Attorney General cites numerous studies to support this theory in the case of tobacco products.~    ~    ~      76~      The Attorney General relies in part on evidence gathered by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in its attempt to regulate the advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. See Regulations Restricting the Sale and Distribution of Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco Products to Protect Children and Adolescents, FDA Proposed Rule, 60 Fed. Reg. 41314 (1995); Regulations Restricting the Sale and Distribution of Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco to Protect Children and Adolescents, FDA Final Rule, 61 Fed. Reg. 44396 (1996). The FDA promulgated the advertising regulations after finding that the period prior to adulthood is when an overwhelming majority of Americans first decide to use tobacco products, and that advertising plays a crucial role in that decision. FDA Final Rule, 61 Fed. Reg., at 44398-44399. We later held that the FDA lacks statutory authority to regulate tobacco products. See FDA v. Brown  Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120 (2000). Nevertheless, the Attorney General relies on the FDA's proceedings and other studies to support his decision that advertising affects demand for tobacco products. Cf. Erie v. Pap's A. M., 529 U.S. 277, 296 (2000) (plurality opinion) (cities and localities may rely on evidence from other jurisdictions to demonstrate harmful secondary effects of adult entertainment and to justify regulation); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560, 583-584 (1991) (Souter, J., concurring in judgment) (same); Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 50-52 (1986) (same). See also Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U.S. 377, 393, and n. 6 (2000) (discussing evidence of corruption and the appearance of corruption in campaign finance).~    ~    ~      77~      In its rulemaking proceeding, the FDA considered several studies of tobacco advertising and trends in the use of various tobacco products. The Surgeon General's report and the Institute of Medicine's report found that \"there is sufficient evidence to conclude that advertising and labeling play a significant and important contributory role in a young person's decision to use cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products.\" 60 Fed. Reg. 41332. See also Pierce et al., Tobacco Industry Promotion of Cigarettes and Adolescent Smoking, 279 JAMA 511, 514 (1998).~    ~    ~      78~      For instance, children smoke fewer brands of cigarettes than adults, and those choices directly track the most heavily advertised brands, unlike adult choices, which are more dispersed and related to pricing. FDA Proposed Rule, 60 Fed. Reg. 41332. Another study revealed that 72% of 6 year olds and 52% of children ages 3 to 6 recognized \"Joe Camel,\" the cartoon anthropomorphic symbol of R. J. Reynolds' Camel brand cigarettes. Id., at 41333. After the introduction of Joe Camel, Camel cigarettes' share of the youth market rose from 4% to 13%. Id., at 41330. The FDA also identified trends in tobacco consumption among certain populations, such as young women, that correlated to the introduction and marketing of products geared toward that population. Id., at 41333.~    ~    ~      79~      The FDA also made specific findings with respect to smokeless tobacco. The FDA concluded that \"[t]he recent and very large increase in the use of smokeless tobacco products by young people and the addictive nature of these products has persuaded the agency that these products must be included in any regulatory approach that is designed to help prevent future generations of young people from becoming addicted to nicotine-containing tobacco products.\" Id., at 41318. Studies have analyzed smokeless tobacco use by young people, discussing trends based on gender, school grade, and locale. See, e.g., Boyd et al., Use of Smokeless Tobacco among Children and Adolescents in the United States, 16 Preventative Medicine 402-418 (1987), Record, Doc. No. 38, Exh. 63.~    ~    ~      80~      Researchers tracked a dramatic shift in patterns of smokeless tobacco use from older to younger users over the past 30 years. See, e.g., FDA Proposed Rule, 60 Fed. Reg., at 41317; Tomar et al., Smokeless tobacco brand preference and brand switching among US adolescents and young adults, 4 Tobacco Control 67 (1995), Record, Doc. No. 38, Exh. 62; Department of Health and Human Services, Preventing Tobacco Use Among Young People: A Report of the Surgeon General 163 (1994), Record, Doc. No. 36, Exh. 1. In particular, the smokeless tobacco industry boosted sales tenfold in the 1970s and 1980s by targeting young males. FDA Proposed Rule, 60 Fed. Reg., at 41331. See also National Cancer Institute, Cigars: Health Effects and Trends, Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph No. 9, p. 16 (1998), Record, Doc. No. 39, Exh. 67. Another study documented the targeting of youth through smokeless tobacco sales and advertising techniques. Ernster, Advertising and Promotion of Smokeless Tobacco Products, National Cancer Institute Monograph No. 8, pp. 87-93 (1989), Record, Doc. No. 38, Exh. 66.~    ~    ~      81~      The Attorney General presents different evidence with respect to cigars. There was no data on underage cigar use prior to 1996 because the behavior was considered \"uncommon enough not to be worthy of examination.\" Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph No. 9, at 13; FTC Report to Congress: Cigar Sales and Advertising and Promotional Expenses for Calendar Years 1996 and 1997, p. 9 (1999), Record, Doc. No. 39, Exh. 71. In 1995, the FDA decided not to include cigars in its attempted regulation of tobacco product advertising, explaining that \"the agency does not currently have sufficient evidence that these products are drug delivery devices ... . FDA has focused its investigation of its authority over tobacco products on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products, and not on pipe tobacco or cigars, because young people predominantly use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products.\" 60 Fed. Reg. 41322.~    ~    ~      82~      More recently, however, data on youth cigar use has emerged. The National Cancer Institute concluded in its 1998 Monograph that the rate of cigar use by minors is increasing and that, in some States, the cigar use rates are higher than the smokeless tobacco use rates for minors. Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph No. 9, at 19, 42-51. In its 1999 Report to Congress, the FTC concluded that \"substantial numbers of adolescents are trying cigars.\" FTC Report to Congress, at 9. See also Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, Youth Use of Cigars: Patterns of Use and Perceptions of Risk (1999), Record, Doc. No. 39, Exh. 78.~    ~    ~      83~      Studies have also demonstrated a link between advertising and demand for cigars. After Congress recognized the power of images in advertising and banned cigarette advertising in electronic media, television advertising of small cigars \"increased dramatically in 1972 and 1973,\" \"filled the void left by cigarette advertisers,\" and \"sales ... soared.\" Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph No. 9, at 24. In 1973, Congress extended the electronic media advertising ban for cigarettes to little cigars. Little Cigar Act, 3, Pub. L. 93-109, 87 Stat. 352, as amended, 15 U.S.C.  1335. In the 1990s, cigar advertising campaigns triggered a boost in sales. Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph No. 9, at 215.~    ~    ~      84~      Our review of the record reveals that the Attorney General has provided ample documentation of the problem with underage use of smokeless tobacco and cigars. In addition, we disagree with petitioners' claim that there is no evidence that preventing targeted campaigns and limiting youth exposure to advertising will decrease underage use of smokeless tobacco and cigars. On this record and in the posture of summary judgment, we are unable to conclude that the Attorney General's decision to regulate advertising of smokeless tobacco and cigars in an effort to combat the use of tobacco products by minors was based on mere \"speculation [and] conjecture.\" Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U.S., at 770.~    ~    2~    ~      85~      Whatever the strength of the Attorney General's evidence to justify the outdoor advertising regulations, however, we conclude that the regulations do not satisfy the fourth step of the Central Hudson analysis. The final step of the Central Hudson analysis, the \"critical inquiry in this case,\" requires a reasonable fit between the means and ends of the regulatory scheme. 447 U.S., at 569. The Attorney General's regulations do not meet this standard. The broad sweep of the regulations indicates that the Attorney General did not \"carefully calculat[e] the costs and benefits associated with the burden on speech imposed\" by the regulations. Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U.S. 410, 417 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted).~    ~    ~      86~      The outdoor advertising regulations prohibit any smokeless tobacco or cigar advertising within 1,000 feet of schools or playgrounds. In the District Court, petitioners maintained that this prohibition would prevent advertising in 87% to 91% of Boston, Worchester, and Springfield, Massachusetts. 84 F. Supp. 2d, at 191. The 87% to 91% figure appears to include not only the effect of the regulations, but also the limitations imposed by other generally applicable zoning restrictions. See App. 161-167. The Attorney General disputed petitioners' figures but \"concede[d] that the reach of the regulations is substantial.\" 218 F.3d, at 50. Thus, the Court of Appeals concluded that the regulations prohibit advertising in a substantial portion of the major metropolitan areas of Massachusetts. Ibid.~    ~    ~      87~      The substantial geographical reach of the Attorney General's outdoor advertising regulations is compounded by other factors. \"Outdoor\" advertising includes not only advertising located outside an establishment, but also advertising inside a store if that advertising is visible from outside the store. The regulations restrict advertisements of any size and the term advertisement also includes oral statements. 940 Code of Mass. Regs 21.03, 22.03 (2000).~    ~    ~      88~      In some geographical areas, these regulations would constitute nearly a complete ban on the communication of truthful information about smokeless tobacco and cigars to adult consumers. The breadth and scope of the regulations, and the process by which the Attorney General adopted the regulations, do not demonstrate a careful calculation of the speech interests involved.~    ~    ~      89~      First, the Attorney General did not seem to consider the impact of the 1,000-foot restriction on commercial speech in major metropolitan areas. The Attorney General apparently selected the 1,000-foot distance based on the FDA's decision to impose an identical 1,000-foot restriction when it attempted to regulate cigarette and smokeless tobacco advertising. See FDA Final Rule, 61 Fed. Reg. 44399; Brief for Respondents 45, and n. 23. But the FDA's 1,000-foot regulation was not an adequate basis for the Attorney General to tailor the Massachusetts regulations. The degree to which speech is suppressed-or alternative avenues for speech remain available-under a particular regulatory scheme tends to be case specific. See, e.g., Renton, 475 U.S., at 53-54. And a case specific analysis makes sense, for although a State or locality may have common interests and concerns about underage smoking and the effects of tobacco advertisements, the impact of a restriction on speech will undoubtedly vary from place to place. The FDA's regulations would have had widely disparate effects nationwide. Even in Massachusetts, the effect of the Attorney General's speech regulations will vary based on whether a locale is rural, suburban, or urban. The uniformly broad sweep of the geographical limitation demonstrates a lack of tailoring.~    ~    ~      90~      In addition, the range of communications restricted seems unduly broad. For instance, it is not clear from the regulatory scheme why a ban on oral communications is necessary to further the State's interest. Apparently that restriction means that a retailer is unable to answer inquiries about its tobacco products if that communication occurs outdoors. Similarly, a ban on all signs of any size seems ill suited to target the problem of highly visible billboards, as opposed to smaller signs. To the extent that studies have identified particular advertising and promotion practices that appeal to youth, tailoring would involve targeting those practices while permitting others. As crafted, the regulations make no distinction among practices on this basis.~    ~    ~      91~      The Court of Appeals recognized that the smokeless tobacco and cigar petitioners' concern about the amount of speech restricted was \"valid,\" but reasoned that there was an \"obvious connection to the state's interest in protecting minors.\" 218 F.3d, at 50. Even on the premise that Massachusetts has demonstrated a connection between the outdoor advertising regulations and its substantial interest in preventing underage tobacco use, the question of tailoring remains. The Court of Appeals failed to follow through with an analysis of the countervailing First Amendment interests.~    ~    ~      92~      The State's interest in preventing underage tobacco use is substantial, and even compelling, but it is no less true that the sale and use of tobacco products by adults is a legal activity. We must consider that tobacco retailers and manufacturers have an interest in conveying truthful information about their products to adults, and adults have a corresponding interest in receiving truthful information about tobacco products. In a case involving indecent speech on the Internet we explained that \"the governmental interest in protecting children from harmful materials ... does not justify an unnecessarily broad suppression of speech addressed to adults.\" Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.S. 844, 875 (1997) (citations omitted). See, e.g., Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U.S. 60, 74 (1983) (\"The level of discourse reaching a mailbox simply cannot be limited to that which would be suitable for a sandbox\"); Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380, 383 (1957) (\"The incidence of this enactment is to reduce the adult population ... to reading only what is fit for children\"). As the State protects children from tobacco advertisements, tobacco manufacturers and retailers and their adult consumers still have a protected interest in communication. Cf. American Civil Liberties Union, supra, at 886-889 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (discussing the creation of \"adult zones\" on the Internet).~    ~    ~      93~      In some instances, Massachusetts' outdoor advertising regulations would impose particularly onerous burdens on speech. For example, we disagree with the Court of Appeals' conclusion that because cigar manufacturers and retailers conduct a limited amount of advertising in comparison to other tobacco products, \"the relative lack of cigar advertising also means that the burden imposed on cigar advertisers is correspondingly small.\" 218 F.3d, at 49. If some retailers have relatively small advertising budgets, and use few avenues of communication, then the Attorney General's outdoor advertising regulations potentially place a greater, not lesser, burden on those retailers' speech. Furthermore, to the extent that cigar products and cigar advertising differ from that of other tobacco products, that difference should inform the inquiry into what speech restrictions are necessary.~    ~    ~      94~      In addition, a retailer in Massachusetts may have no means of communicating to passersby on the street that it sells tobacco products because alternative forms of advertisement, like newspapers, do not allow that retailer to propose an instant transaction in the way that onsite advertising does. The ban on any indoor advertising that is visible from the outside also presents problems in establishments like convenience stores, which have unique security concerns that counsel in favor of full visibility of the store from the outside. It is these sorts of considerations that the Attorney General failed to incorporate into the regulatory scheme.~    ~    ~      95~      We conclude that the Attorney General has failed to show that the outdoor advertising regulations for smokeless tobacco and cigars are not more extensive than necessary to advance the State's substantial interest in preventing underage tobacco use. Justice Stevens urges that the Court remand the case for further development of the factual record. Post, at 12-14. We believe that a remand is inappropriate in this case because the State had ample opportunity to develop a record with respect to tailoring (as it had to justify its decision to regulate advertising), and additional evidence would not alter the nature of the scheme before the Court. See Greater New Orleans, 527 U.S., at 189, n. 6.~    ~    ~      96~      A careful calculation of the costs of a speech regulation does not mean that a State must demonstrate that there is no incursion on legitimate speech interests, but a speech regulation cannot unduly impinge on the speaker's ability to propose a commercial transaction and the adult listener's opportunity to obtain information about products. After reviewing the outdoor advertising regulations, we find the calculation in this case insufficient for purposes of the First Amendment.~    ~    C~    ~      97~      Massachusetts has also restricted indoor, point-of-sale advertising for smokeless tobacco and cigars. Advertising cannot be \"placed lower than five feet from the floor of any retail establishment which is located within a one thousand foot radius of\" any school or playground. 940 Code of Mass. Regs. 21.04(5)(b), 22.06(5)(b) (2000). The District Court invalidated these provisions, concluding that the Attorney General had not provided a sufficient basis for regulating indoor advertising. 84 F. Supp. 2d, at 192-193, 195. The Court of Appeals reversed. 218 F.3d, at 50-51. The court explained: \"We do have some misgivings about the effectiveness of a restriction that is based on the assumption that minors under five feet tall will not, or will less frequently, raise their view above eye-level, but we find that such [a] determination falls within that range of reasonableness in which the Attorney General is best suited to pass judgment.\" Id., at 51.~    ~    ~      98~      We conclude that the point-of-sale advertising regulations fail both the third and fourth steps of the Central Hudson analysis. A regulation cannot be sustained if it \" 'provides only ineffective or remote support for the government's purpose,' \" Edenfield, 507 U.S., at 770 (quoting Central Hudson, 447 U.S., at 564), or if there is \"little chance\" that the restriction will advance the State's goal, Greater New Orleans, supra, at 193 (internal quotation marks omitted). As outlined above, the State's goal is to prevent minors from using tobacco products and to curb demand for that activity by limiting youth exposure to advertising. The 5 foot rule does not seem to advance that goal. Not all children are less than 5 feet tall, and those who are certainly have the ability to look up and take in their surroundings.~    ~    ~      99~      By contrast to Justice Stevens, post, at 16-17, we do not believe this regulation can be construed as a mere regulation of conduct under United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968). To qualify as a regulation of communicative action governed by the scrutiny outlined in O'Brien, the State's regulation must be unrelated to expression. Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 403 (1989). See also Erie v. Pap's A. M., 529 U.S. 277, 289-296 (2000) (plurality opinion). Here, Massachusetts' height restriction is an attempt to regulate directly the communicative impact of indoor advertising.~    ~    ~      100~      Massachusetts may wish to target tobacco advertisements and displays that entice children, much like floor-level candy displays in a convenience store, but the blanket height restriction does not constitute a reasonable fit with that goal. The Court of Appeals recognized that the efficacy of the regulation was questionable, but decided that \"[i]n any event, the burden on speech imposed by the provision is very limited.\" 218 F.3d, at 51. There is no de minimis exception for a speech restriction that lacks sufficient tailoring or justification. We conclude that the restriction on the height of indoor advertising is invalid under Central Hudson's third and fourth prongs.~    ~    D~    ~      101~      The Attorney General also promulgated a number of regulations that restrict sales practices by cigarette, smokeless tobacco, and cigar manufacturers and retailers. Among other restrictions, the regulations bar the use of self-service displays and require that tobacco products be placed out of the reach of all consumers in a location accessible only to salespersons. 940 Code of Mass. Regs. 21.04(2)(c)-(d), 22.06(2)(c)-(d) (2000). The cigarette petitioners do not challenge the sales practices regulations on pre-emption grounds. Brief for Petitioners Lorillard Tobacco Co. et al. in No. 00-596, at 5, n. 2. Two of the cigarette petitioners (Brown  Williamson Tobacco Corporation and Lorillard Tobacco Company), petitioner U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company, and the cigar petitioners challenge the sales practices regulations on First Amendment grounds. The cigar petitioners additionally challenge a provision that prohibits sampling or promotional giveaways of cigars or little cigars. 940 Code of Mass. Regs. 22.06(1)(a).~    ~    ~      102~      The District Court concluded that these restrictions implicate no cognizable speech interest, 84 F. Supp. 2d, at 195-196, but the Court of Appeals did not fully adopt that reasoning. The Court of Appeals recognized that self-service displays \"often do have some communicative commercial function,\" but noted that the restriction in the regulations \"is not on speech, but rather on the physical location of actual tobacco products.\" 218 F.3d, at 53. The court reasoned that nothing in the regulations would prevent the display of empty tobacco product containers, so long as no actual tobacco product was displayed, much like movie jackets at a video store. Ibid. With respect to cigar products, the court observed that retailers traditionally allow access to those products, so that the consumer may make a selection on the basis of a number of objective and subjective factors including the aroma and feel of the cigars. Ibid. Even assuming a speech interest, however, the court concluded that the regulations were narrowly tailored to serve the State's substantial interest in preventing access to tobacco products by minors. Id., at 54. The court also noted that the restrictions do not apply to adult-only establishments. Ibid.~    ~    ~      103~      Petitioners devoted little of their briefing to the sales practices regulations, and our understanding of the regulations is accordingly limited by the parties' submissions. As we read the regulations, they basically require tobacco retailers to place tobacco products behind counters and require customers to have contact with a salesperson before they are able to handle a tobacco product.~    ~    ~      104~      The cigarette and smokeless tobacco petitioners contend that \"the same First Amendment principles that require invalidation of the outdoor and indoor advertising restrictions require invalidation of the display regulations at issue in this case.\" Brief for Petitioners Lorillard Tobacco Co. et al. in No. 00-596, at 46, n. 7. See also Reply Brief for Petitioner U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Co. in Nos. 00-596 and 00-597, at 12, n. 7. The cigar petitioners contend that self-service displays for cigars cannot be prohibited because each brand of cigar is unique and customers traditionally have sought to handle and compare cigars at the time of purchase. Brief for Petitioners Altadis U.S. A. Inc. et al. in No. 00-597, at 23, n. 9; Reply Brief for Petitioners Altadis U.S. A. Inc. et al. in No. 00-597, p. 10, n. 7.~    ~    ~      105~      We reject these contentions. Assuming that petitioners have a cognizable speech interest in a particular means of displaying their products, cf. Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U.S. 410 (1993) (distribution of a magazine through newsracks), these regulations withstand First Amendment scrutiny.~    ~    ~      106~      Massachusetts' sales practices provisions regulate conduct that may have a communicative component, but Massachusetts seeks to regulate the placement of tobacco products for reasons unrelated to the communication of ideas. See O'Brien, supra, at 382. See also Pap's A. M., 529 U.S., at 289 (plurality opinion); id., at 310 (Souter, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); Johnson, 491 U.S., at 403. We conclude that the State has demonstrated a substantial interest in preventing access to tobacco products by minors and has adopted an appropriately narrow means of advancing that interest. See O'Brien, supra, at 382.~    ~    ~      107~      Unattended displays of tobacco products present an opportunity for access without the proper age verification required by law. Thus, the State prohibits self-service and other displays that would allow an individual to obtain tobacco products without direct contact with a salesperson. It is clear that the regulations leave open ample channels of communication. The regulations do not significantly impede adult access to tobacco products. Moreover, retailers have other means of exercising any cognizable speech interest in the presentation of their products. We presume that vendors may place empty tobacco packaging on open display, and display actual tobacco products so long as that display is only accessible to sales personnel. As for cigars, there is no indication in the regulations that a customer is unable to examine a cigar prior to purchase, so long as that examination takes place through a salesperson.~    ~    ~      108~      The cigar petitioners also list Massachusetts' prohibition on sampling and free giveaways among the regulations they challenge on First Amendment grounds. See 940 Code of Mass. Regs. 22.06(1)(a) (2000); Brief for Petitioners Altadis U.S. A. Inc. et al. in No. 00-597, at 2. At no point in their briefs or at oral argument, however, did the cigar petitioners argue the merits of their First Amendment claim with respect to the sampling and giveaway regulation. We decline to address an issue that was not sufficiently briefed and argued before this Court. See Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. County of Kent, 510 U.S. 355, 366, n. 10 (1994); Williams v. United States, 503 U.S. 193, 206 (1992); Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U.S. 33, 38-40 (1989).~    ~    ~      109~      We conclude that the sales practices regulations withstand First Amendment scrutiny. The means chosen by the State are narrowly tailored to prevent access to tobacco products by minors, are unrelated to expression, and leave open alternative avenues for vendors to convey information about products and for would-be customers to inspect products before purchase.~    ~    IV~    ~      110~      We have observed that \"tobacco use, particularly among children and adolescents, poses perhaps the single most significant threat to public health in the United States.\" FDA v. Brown  Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S., at 161. From a policy perspective, it is understandable for the States to attempt to prevent minors from using tobacco products before they reach an age where they are capable of weighing for themselves the risks and potential benefits of tobacco use, and other adult activities. Federal law, however, places limits on policy choices available to the States.~    ~    ~      111~      In this case, Congress enacted a comprehensive scheme to address cigarette smoking and health in advertising and pre-empted state regulation of cigarette advertising that attempts to address that same concern, even with respect to youth. The First Amendment also constrains state efforts to limit advertising of tobacco products, because so long as the sale and use of tobacco is lawful for adults, the tobacco industry has a protected interest in communicating information about its products and adult customers have an interest in receiving that information.~    ~    ~      112~      To the extent that federal law and the First Amendment do not prohibit state action, States and localities remain free to combat the problem of underage tobacco use by appropriate means. The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit is therefore affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      113~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      114~      Kennedy, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, in which Scalia, J., joined.~    ~    ~      115~      Thomas, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.~    ~    ~      116~      Souter, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.~    ~    ~      117~      Stevens, J., filed an opinion concurring in part, concurring in the judgment in part, and dissenting in part, in which Ginsburg and Breyer, JJ., joined, and in Part I of which Souter, J., joined.~    ~    ~      ~        Notes~      ~      ~        *~         The Senate Report explained that the pre-emption provision \"would in no way affect the power of any State or political subdivision of any State with respect to the taxation or the sale of cigarettes to minors, or the prohibition of smoking in public buildings, or similar police regulations. It is limited entirely to State or local requirements or prohibitions in the advertising of cigarettes.\" S. Rep. No. 91-566, p. 12 (1969).~      ~    ~    ~      118~      Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice Scalia joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.~    ~    ~      119~      The obvious overbreadth of the outdoor advertising restrictions suffices to invalidate them under the fourth part of the test in Central Hudson Gas  Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U.S. 557 (1980). As a result, in my view, there is no need to consider whether the restrictions satisfy the third part of the test, a proposition about which there is considerable doubt. Cf. post, at 13-14 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Neither are we required to consider whether Central Hudson should be retained in the face of the substantial objections that can be made to it. See post, at 4-11 (opinion of Thomas, J.). My continuing concerns that the test gives insufficient protection to truthful, nonmisleading commercial speech require me to refrain from expressing agreement with the Court's application of the third part of Central Hudson. See, e.g., 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U.S. 484, 501-504 (1996) (opinion of Stevens, J., joined by Kennedy and Ginsburg, JJ.). With the exception of Part III-B-1, then, I join the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      120~      Justice Thomas, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.~    ~    ~      121~      I join the opinion of the Court (with the exception of Part III-B-1) because I agree that the Massachusetts cigarette advertising regulations are preempted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, 15 U.S.C.  1331 et seq. I also agree with the Court's disposition of the First Amendment challenges to the other regulations at issue here, and I share the Court's view that the regulations fail even the intermediate scrutiny of Central Hudson Gas  Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U.S. 557 (1980). At the same time, I continue to believe that when the government seeks to restrict truthful speech in order to suppress the ideas it conveys, strict scrutiny is appropriate, whether or not the speech in question may be characterized as \"commercial.\" See 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U.S. 484, 518 (1996) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). I would subject all of the advertising restrictions to strict scrutiny and would hold that they violate the First Amendment.~    ~    ~      122~      * At the heart of this litigation is a Massachusetts regulation that imposes a sweeping ban on speech about tobacco products. 940 Code of Mass. Regs. 21.04(5) (2000), which governs cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, and 22.06(5), which governs cigars, prohibit all outdoor advertising, all indoor advertising that can be seen from outdoors, and all point-of-sale advertising (even if not visible from outdoors) that is lower than five feet from the floor.1 These restrictions are superficially limited in their geographic scope: they apply only within 1,000 feet of \"any public playground, playground area in a public park, elementary school or secondary school.\" 21.04(5)(a). But the Court of Appeals acknowledged that the zone of prohibition covers as much as 90 percent of the three largest cities in Massachusetts, Consolidated Cigar Corp. v. Reilly, 218 F.3d 30, 50 (CA1 2000), so the practical effect is little different from that of a total ban. Cf. United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 812 (2000) (\"The Government's content-based burdens must satisfy the same rigorous scrutiny as its content-based bans\").~    ~    ~      123~      Respondents suggest in passing that the regulations are \"zoning-type restrictions\" that should receive \"the intermediate level of scrutiny traditionally associated with various forms of 'time, place, and manner' regulations.\" Brief for Respondents 31. We have indeed upheld time, place, and manner regulations that prohibited certain kinds of outdoor signs, see, e.g., Members of City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789 (1984), and we have similarly upheld zoning laws that had the effect of restricting certain kinds of sexually explicit expression, see, e.g., Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986). But the abiding characteristic of valid time, place, and manner regulations is their content neutrality. See Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791-796 (1989). In Vincent the city prohibited all signs on public property, not to suppress the message conveyed by any of the signs, but simply to minimize the esthetic effect of visual clutter. Likewise, the ordinance in Renton was aimed not at expression, but at the \"secondary effects\" caused by adult businesses.~    ~    ~      124~      The regulations here are very different. Massachusetts is not concerned with any \"secondary effects\" of tobacco advertising-it is concerned with the advertising's primary effect, which is to induce those who view the advertisements to purchase and use tobacco products. Cf. Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 321 (1988) (\"Listeners' reactions to speech are not the type of 'secondary effects' we referred to in Renton\"). In other words, it seeks to suppress speech about tobacco because it objects to the content of that speech. We have consistently applied strict scrutiny to such content-based regulations of speech. See, e.g., Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 641-643 (1994).~    ~    ~      125~      * There was once a time when this Court declined to give any First Amendment protection to commercial speech. In Valentine v. Chrestensen, 316 U.S. 52 (1942), the Court went so far as to say that \"the Constitution imposes [no] restraint on government as respects purely commercial advertising.\" Id., at 54. That position was repudiated in Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 748 (1976), which explained that even speech \"which does 'no more than propose a commercial transaction' \" is protected by the First Amendment. Id., at 762 (quoting Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Comm'n on Human Relations, 413 U.S. 376, 385 (1973)). Since then, the Court has followed an uncertain course-much of the uncertainty being generated by the malleability of the four-part balancing test of Central Hudson. See 44 Liquormart, 517 U.S., at 520-522 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).~    ~    ~      126~      I have observed previously that there is no \"philosophical or historical basis for asserting that 'commercial' speech is of 'lower value' than 'noncommercial' speech.\" Id., at 522. Indeed, I doubt whether it is even possible to draw a coherent distinction between commercial and noncommercial speech. See id., at 523, n. 4 (citing Kozinski  Banner, Who's Afraid of Commercial Speech, 76 Va. L. Rev. 627 (1990)).2~    ~    ~      127~      It should be clear that if these regulations targeted anything other than advertising for commercial products-if, for example, they were directed at billboards promoting political candidates-all would agree that the restrictions should be subjected to strict scrutiny. In my view, an asserted government interest in keeping people ignorant by suppressing expression \"is per se illegitimate and can no more justify regulation of 'commercial' speech than it can justify regulation of 'noncommercial' speech.\" 517 U.S., at 518 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). That is essentially the interest asserted here, and, adhering to the views I expressed in 44 Liquormart, I would subject the Massachusetts regulations to strict scrutiny.~    ~    B~    ~      128~      Even if one accepts the premise that commercial speech generally is entitled to a lower level of constitutional protection than are other forms of speech, it does not follow that the regulations here deserve anything less than strict scrutiny. Although we have recognized several categories of speech that normally receive reduced First Amendment protection, or no First Amendment protection at all, we have never held that the government may regulate speech within those categories in any way that it wishes. Rather, we have said \"that these areas of speech can, consistently with the First Amendment, be regulated because of their constitutionally proscribable content.\" R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 383 (1992). Even when speech falls into a category of reduced constitutional protection, the government may not engage in content discrimination for reasons unrelated to those characteristics of the speech that place it within the category. For example, a city may ban obscenity (because obscenity is an unprotected category, see, e.g., Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476 (1957)), but it may not ban \"only those legally obscene works that contain criticism of the city government.\" R. A. V., supra, at 384.~    ~    ~      129~      In explaining the distinction between commercial speech and other forms of speech, we have emphasized that commercial speech is both \"more easily verifiable by its disseminator\" and less likely to be \"chilled by proper regulation.\" Virginia Bd., 425 U.S., at 772, n. 24. These characteristics led us to conclude that, in the context of commercial speech, it is \"less necessary to tolerate inaccurate statements for fear of silencing the speaker,\" and also that it is more \"appropriate to require that a commercial message appear in such a form, or include such additional information, warnings, and disclaimers, as are necessary to prevent its being deceptive.\" Ibid. Whatever the validity of this reasoning, it is limited to the peculiarly commercial harms that commercial speech can threaten-i.e., the risk of deceptive or misleading advertising. As we observed in R. A. V.: \"[A] State may choose to regulate price advertising in one industry but not in others, because the risk of fraud (one of the characteristics of commercial speech that justifies depriving it of full First Amendment protection) is in its view greater there. But a State may not prohibit only that commercial advertising that depicts men in a demeaning fashion.\" 505 U.S., at 388-389 (citations omitted).~    ~    ~      130~      In 44 Liquormart, several Members of the Court said much the same thing: \"[W]hen a State entirely prohibits the dissemination of truthful, nonmisleading commercial messages for reasons unrelated to the preservation of a fair bargaining process, there is far less reason to depart from the rigorous review that the First Amendment generally demands.\" 517 U.S., at 501 (opinion of Stevens, J., joined by Kennedy and Ginsburg, JJ.). Whatever power the State may have to regulate commercial speech, it may not use that power to limit the content of commercial speech, as it has done here, \"for reasons unrelated to the preservation of a fair bargaining process.\" Such content-discriminatory regulation-like all other content-based regulation of speech-must be subjected to strict scrutiny.~    ~    C~    ~      131~      In an effort to avoid the implications of these basic principles of First Amendment law, respondents make two principal claims. First, they argue that the regulations target deceptive and misleading speech. See Brief for Respondents 33 (\"Petitioners' advertising clearly engenders 'the potential for deception or confusion' that allows for regulation of commercial speech based on its content\" (quoting Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U.S. 60, 65 (1983)). Second, they argue that the regulations restrict speech that promotes an illegal transaction-i.e., the sale of tobacco to minors. See Brief for Respondents 15 (\"The regulations . . . exhibit a close connection to a commercial transaction the State has prohibited\").~    ~    ~      132~      Neither theory is properly before the Court. For purposes of summary judgment, respondents were willing to assume \"that the tobacco advertisements at issue here are truthful, nonmisleading speech about a lawful activity.\" 218 F.3d, at 43. Although respondents now claim that they have not conceded this point, see Brief for Respondent 35, n. 17, the fact remains that they did not urge their theories in the lower courts, and in general, we do not consider arguments for affirmance that were not presented below. See, e.g., Glover v. United States, 531 U.S. 198, 205 (2001). These concessions should make this an easy case, one clearly controlled by 44 Liquormart and by Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Assn., Inc. v. United States, 527 U.S. 173 (1999). At all events, even if we were to entertain these arguments, neither is persuasive.~    ~    ~      133~      Respondents suggest that tobacco advertising is misleading because \"its youthful imagery and ... sheer ubiquity\" leads children to believe \"that tobacco use is desirable and pervasive.\" Brief for Respondents 33; see also Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 7 (\"[S]o many children lack the maturity in judgment to resist the tobacco industry's appeals to excitement, glamour, and independence\"). This justification is belied, however, by the sweeping overinclusivity of the regulations. Massachusetts has done nothing to target its prohibition to advertisements appealing to \"excitement, glamour, and independence\"; the ban applies with equal force to appeals to torpor, homeliness, and servility. It has not focused on \"youthful imagery\"; smokers depicted on the sides of buildings may no more play shuffleboard than they may ride skateboards.~    ~    ~      134~      The regulations even prohibit a store from accurately stating the prices at which cigarettes are sold. Such a display could not possibly be misleading, unless one accepts the State's apparent view that the simple existence of tobacco advertisements misleads people into believing that tobacco use is more pervasive than it actually is. The State misunderstands the purpose of advertising. Promoting a product that is not yet pervasively used (or a cause that is not yet widely supported) is a primary purpose of advertising. Tobacco advertisements would be no more misleading for suggesting pervasive use of tobacco products than are any other advertisements that attempt to expand a market for a product, or to rally support for a political movement. Any inference from the advertisements that businesses would like for tobacco use to be pervasive is entirely reasonable, and advertising that gives rise to that inference is in no way deceptive.~    ~    ~      135~      The State also contends that tobacco advertisements may be restricted because they propose an illegal sale of tobacco to minors. A direct solicitation of unlawful activity may of course be proscribed, whether or not it is commercial in nature. See Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969) (per curiam). The State's power to punish speech that solicits or incites crime has nothing to do with the commercial character of the speech. After all, it is often the case that solicitation to commit a crime is entirely noncommercial. The harm that the State seeks to prevent is the harm caused by the unlawful activity that is solicited; it is unrelated to the commercial transaction itself. Thus there is no reason to apply anything other than our usual rule for evaluating solicitation and incitement simply because the speech in question happens to be commercial. See Carey v. Population Services Int'l, 431 U.S. 678, 701-702 (1977).~    ~    ~      136~      Viewed as an effort to proscribe solicitation to unlawful conduct, these regulations clearly fail the Brandenburg test. A State may not \"forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.\" Brandenburg, supra, at 447. Even if Massachusetts could prohibit advertisements reading, \"Hey kids, buy cigarettes here,\" these regulations sweep much more broadly than that. They cover \"any . . . statement or representation . . . the purpose or effect of which is to promote the use or sale\" of tobacco products, whether or not the statement is directly or indirectly addressed to minors. 940 Code of Mass. Regs. 21.03 (2000). On respondents' theory, all tobacco advertising may be limited because some of its viewers may not legally act on it.~    ~    ~      137~      It is difficult to see any stopping point to a rule that would allow a State to prohibit all speech in favor of an activity in which it is illegal for minors to engage. Presumably, the State could ban car advertisements in an effort to enforce its restrictions on underage driving. It could regulate advertisements urging people to vote, because children are not permitted to vote. And, although the Solicitor General resisted this implication of her theory, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 55-56, the State could prohibit advertisements for adult businesses, which children are forbidden to patronize.~    ~    ~      138~      At bottom, respondents' theory rests on the premise that an indirect solicitation is enough to empower the State to regulate speech, and that, as petitioners put it, even an advertisement directed at adults \"will give any children who may happen to see it the wrong idea and therefore must be suppressed from public view.\" Brief for Petitioners Lorillard Tobacco Co. et al. in No. 00-596, p. 36. This view is foreign to the First Amendment. \"Every idea is an incitement,\" Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S. 652, 673 (1925) (Holmes, J., dissenting), and if speech may be suppressed whenever it might inspire someone to act unlawfully, then there is no limit to the State's censorial power. Cf. American Booksellers Assn., Inc. v. Hudnut, 771 F.2d 323 (CA7 1985), aff'd, 475 U.S. 1001 (1986).~    ~    ~      139~      There is a deeper flaw in the State's argument. Even if Massachusetts has a valid interest in regulating speech directed at children-who, it argues, may be more easily misled, and to whom the sale of tobacco products is unlawful-it may not pursue that interest at the expense of the free speech rights of adults.~    ~    ~      140~      The theory that public debate should be limited in order to protect impressionable children has a long historical pedigree: Socrates was condemned for being \"a doer of evil, inasmuch as he corrupts the youth.\" 1 Dialogues of Plato, Apology 348 (B. Jowett transl., 4th ed. 1953). But the theory has met with a less enthusiastic reception in this Court than it did in the Athenian assembly. In Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380 (1957), we struck down a statute restricting the sale of materials \" 'tending to incite minors to violent or depraved or immoral acts.' \" Id., at 381 (quoting then Mich. Penal Code 343). The effect of the law, we observed, was \"to reduce the adult population of Michigan to reading only what is fit for children.\" 352 U.S., at 383. As Justice Frankfurter colorfully put it, \"Surely, this is to burn the house to roast the pig.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      141~      We have held consistently that speech \"cannot be suppressed solely to protect the young from ideas or images that a legislative body thinks unsuitable for them.\" Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 213-214 (1975); accord, Bolger, 463 U.S., at 74 (\"The level of discourse reaching a mailbox simply cannot be limited to that which would be suitable for a sandbox\"). To be sure, in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978), we upheld the Federal Communications Commission's power to regulate indecent but nonobscene radio broadcasts. But Pacifica relied heavily on what it considered to be the \"special justifications for regulation of the broadcast media that are not applicable to other speakers.\" Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.S. 844, 868 (1997). It emphasized that radio is \"uniquely pervasive\" and \"uniquely accessible to children, even those too young to read.\" Pacifica, supra, at 748-749 (emphasis added).~    ~    ~      142~      Outside of the broadcasting context, we have adhered to the view that \"the governmental interest in protecting children from harmful materials\" does not \"justify an unnecessarily broad suppression of speech addressed to adults.\" Reno, supra, at 875; see also Playboy Entertainment, 529 U.S., at 814 (\"[T]he objective of shielding children does not suffice to support a blanket ban if the protection can be accomplished by a less restrictive alternative\"). Massachusetts may not avoid the application of strict scrutiny simply because it seeks to protect children.~    ~    II~    ~      143~      Under strict scrutiny, the advertising ban may be saved only if it is narrowly tailored to promote a compelling government interest. See, e.g., id., at 813. If that interest could be served by an alternative that is less restrictive of speech, then the State must use that alternative instead. See ibid.; Reno, supra, at 874. Applying this standard, the regulations here must fail.~    ~    ~      144~      * Massachusetts asserts a compelling interest in reducing tobacco use among minors. Applied to adults, an interest in manipulating market choices by keeping people ignorant would not be legitimate, let alone compelling. See supra, at 5. But assuming that there is a compelling interest in reducing underage smoking, and that the ban on outdoor advertising promotes this interest, I doubt that the same is true of the ban on point-of-sale advertising below five feet. See 940 Code of Mass. Regs. 21.04(5)(b), 22.06(5)(b) (2000). The Court of Appeals admitted to having \"some misgivings about the effectiveness of a restriction that is based on the assumption that minors under five feet tall will not, or will less frequently, raise their view above eye-level,\" 218 F.3d, at 51, as well it might have, since respondents have produced no evidence to support this counterintuitive assumption. Obviously even short children can see objects that are taller than they are. Anyway, by the time they are 12 1/2 years old, both the median girl and the median boy are over five feet tall. See U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Growth Charts (2000). Thus, there is no reason to believe that this regulation does anything to protect minors from exposure to tobacco advertising.3 Far from serving a compelling interest, the ban on displays below five feet seems to lack even a minimally rational relationship to any conceivable interest.~    ~    ~      145~      There is also considerable reason to doubt that the restrictions on cigar and smokeless tobacco outdoor advertising promote any state interest. Outdoor advertising for cigars, after all, is virtually nonexistent. Cigar makers use no billboards in Massachusetts, and in fact their nationwide outdoor advertising budget is only about $50,000 per year. See 218 F.3d, at 49. To the extent outdoor advertising exists, there is no evidence that it is targeted at youth or has a significant effect on youth. The Court of Appeals focused on the State's evidence of a relationship between \"tobacco advertising and tobacco use,\" id., at 48, thus eliding the dearth of evidence showing any relationship between cigar advertising and cigar use by minors. Respondents principally rely on a National Cancer Institute report on cigar smoking, see Brief for Respondents 39, n. 19. But that report contains only the conclusory assertion that cigars are being \"heavily promoted in ways likely to influence adolescent use,\" and it does not even discuss outdoor advertising, instead focusing on \"[e]ndorsements by celebrities,\" \"the resurgence of cigar smoking in movies,\" and \"cigar lifestyle magazines such as 'Cigar Aficionado.' \" National Cancer Institute, Cigars: Health Effects and Trends, Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph No. 9, pp. 14-15 (1998), Record, Doc. No. 39, Exh. 67. The report candidly acknowledges that \"[a]dditional information is needed to better characterize marketing efforts for cigars\" and \"to learn the extent to which advertising and promotion for cigars . . . reaches and affects kids.\" Id., at 216-217. In other words, respondents have adduced no evidence that a ban on cigar advertising will do anything to promote their asserted interest.~    ~    ~      146~      Much the same is true of smokeless tobacco. Here respondents place primary reliance on evidence that, in the late 1960's, the U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company increased its sales through advertising targeted at young males. See Brief for Respondents 39, n. 19. But this does nothing to show that advertising affecting minors is a problem today. The Court invokes the Food and Drug Administration's findings, see ante, at 29-30, but the report it cites based its conclusions on the observed \"very large increase in the use of smokeless tobacco products by young people.\" 60 Fed. Reg. 41318 (1995). This premise is contradicted by one of respondents' own studies, which reports a large, steady decrease in smokeless tobacco use among Massachusetts high school students during the 1990's. See App. 292. This finding casts some doubt on whether the State's interest in additional regulation is truly compelling. More importantly, because cigarette smoking among high school students has not exhibited such a trend, see ibid., it indicates that respondents' effort to aggregate cigarettes and smokeless tobacco is misguided.~    ~    B~    ~      147~      In any case, even assuming that the regulations advance a compelling state interest, they must be struck down because they are not narrowly tailored. The Court is correct, see ante, at 32-33, that the arbitrary 1,000-foot radius demonstrates a lack of narrow tailoring, but the problem goes deeper than that. A prohibited zone defined solely by circles drawn around schools and playgrounds is necessarily overinclusive, regardless of the radii of the circles. Consider, for example, a billboard located within 1,000 feet of a school but visible only from an elevated freeway that runs nearby. Such a billboard would not threaten any of the interests respondents assert, but it would be banned anyway, because the regulations take no account of whether the advertisement could even be seen by children. The prohibited zone is even more suspect where, as here, it includes all but 10 percent of the area in the three largest cities in the State.~    ~    ~      148~      The loose tailoring of the advertising ban is displayed not only in its geographic scope but also in the nature of the advertisements it affects. The regulations define \"advertisement\" very broadly; the term includes any \"written ... statement or representation, made by\" a person who sells tobacco products, \"the purpose or effect of which is to promote the use or sale of the product.\" 21.03. Almost everything a business does has the purpose of promoting the sale of its products, so this definition would cover anything a tobacco retailer might say. Some of the prohibited speech would not even be commercial. If a store displayed a sign promoting a candidate for Attorney General who had promised to repeal the tobacco regulations if elected, it probably would be doing so with the long-term purpose of promoting sales, and the display of such a sign would be illegal.~    ~    ~      149~      Even if the definition of \"advertisement\" were read more narrowly so as to require a specific reference to tobacco products, it still would have Draconian effects. It would, for example, prohibit a tobacconist from displaying a sign reading \"Joe's Cigar Shop.\" The effect of this rule is not to make cigars impossible to find; retailers are after all allowed to display a 576-square-inch black-and-white sign reading \"Tobacco Products Sold Here.\" 22.06(6). Rather, it is to make individual cigar retailers more difficult to identify by making them change their names. Respondents assert no interest in cigar retailer anonymity, and it is difficult to conceive of any other interest to which this rule could be said to be narrowly tailored.~    ~    ~      150~      The regulations fail the narrow tailoring inquiry for another, more fundamental reason. In addition to examining a narrower advertising ban, the State should have examined ways of advancing its interest that do not require limiting speech at all. Here, respondents had several alternatives. Most obviously, they could have directly regulated the conduct with which they were concerned. See, e.g., Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U.S. 476, 490-491 (1995) (invalidating ban on disclosure of alcohol content on beer labels, in part because the Government could have pursued alternatives such as \"directly limiting the alcohol content of beers\"); see also 44 Liquormart, 517 U.S., at 524 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\"[I]t would seem that directly banning a product (or ... otherwise restricting its sale in specific ways) would virtually always be at least as effective in discouraging consumption as merely restricting advertising\"). Massachusetts already prohibits the sale of tobacco to minors, but it could take steps to enforce that prohibition more vigorously. It also could enact laws prohibiting the purchase, possession, or use of tobacco by minors. And, if its concern is that tobacco advertising communicates a message with which it disagrees, it could seek to counteract that message with \"more speech, not enforced silence,\" Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357, 377 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring).~    ~    III~    ~      151~      Underlying many of the arguments of respondents and their amici is the idea that tobacco is in some sense sui generis-that it is so special, so unlike any other object of regulation, that application of normal First Amendment principles should be suspended. See, e.g., Brief for Respondents 50 (referring to tobacco use as \"one of the State's-and indeed the Nation's-most urgent problems\"); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19-20 (cataloging the prevalence and the effects of tobacco use); Brief for American Medical Association et al. as Amici Curiae 24 (advocating \"the authority of governments to protect children from uniquely dangerous messages\"). Smoking poses serious health risks, and advertising may induce children (who lack the judgment to make an intelligent decision about whether to smoke) to begin smoking, which can lead to addiction. The State's assessment of the urgency of the problem posed by tobacco is a policy judgment, and it is not this Court's place to second-guess it. Nevertheless, it seems appropriate to point out that to uphold the Massachusetts tobacco regulations would be to accept a line of reasoning that would permit restrictions on advertising for a host of other products.~    ~    ~      152~      Tobacco use is, we are told, \"the single leading cause of preventable death in the United States.\" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19. The second largest contributor to mortality rates in the United States is obesity. Koplan  Dietz, Caloric Imbalance and Public Health Policy, 282 JAMA 1579 (1999). It is associated with increased incidence of diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease, ibid., and it represents a public health problem that is rapidly growing worse. See Mokdad et al., The Spread of the Obesity Epidemic in the United States, 1991-1998, 282 JAMA 1519 (1999). Although the growth of obesity over the last few decades has had many causes, a significant factor has been the increased availability of large quantities of high-calorie, high-fat foods. See Hill, Environmental Contributions to the Obesity Epidemic, 280 Science 1371 (1998). Such foods, of course, have been aggressively marketed and promoted by fast food companies. See Nestle  Jacobson, Halting the Obesity Epidemic, U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, 115 Public Health Reports 12, 18 (2000).~    ~    ~      153~      Respondents say that tobacco companies are covertly targeting children in their advertising. Fast food companies do so openly. See, e.g., Kramer, McD's Steals Another Toy from BK, Advertising Age, Nov. 15, 1999, p. 1 (describing a McDonald's promotional campaign); Lucas, BK Takes Choice Message to Kids, Adweek, June 29, 1998, p. 4 (describing a Burger King promotional campaign). Moreover, there is considerable evidence that they have been successful in changing children's eating behavior. See Borzekowski  Robinson, The 30-Second Effect, 101 J. Am. Dietetic Assn. 42 (2001); Taras, Sallis, Patterson, Nader,  Nelson, Television's Influence on Children's Diet and Physical Activity, 10 J. Dev.  Behav. Pediatrics 176 (1989). The effect of advertising on children's eating habits is significant for two reasons. First, childhood obesity is a serious health problem in its own right. Troiano  Flegal, Overweight Children and Adolescents, 101 Pediatrics 497 (1998). Second, eating preferences formed in childhood tend to persist in adulthood. Birch  Fisher, Development of Eating Behaviors Among Children and Adolescents, 101 Pediatrics 539 (1998). So even though fast food is not addictive in the same way tobacco is, children's exposure to fast food advertising can have deleterious consequences that are difficult to reverse.~    ~    ~      154~      To take another example, the third largest cause of preventable deaths in the United States is alcohol. McGinnis  Foege, Actual Causes of Death in the United States, 270 JAMA 2207, 2208 (1993). Alcohol use is associated with tens of thousands of deaths each year from cancers and digestive diseases. Id., at 2208-2209. And the victims of alcohol use are not limited to those who drink alcohol. In 1996, over 17,000 people were killed, and over 321,000 people were injured, in alcohol-related car accidents. U.S. Dept. of Justice, Alcohol and Crime 13 (1998). Each year, alcohol is involved in several million violent crimes, including almost 200,000 sexual assaults. Id., at 3-4.~    ~    ~      155~      Although every State prohibits the sale of alcohol to those under age 21, much alcohol advertising is viewed by children. Federal Trade Commission, J. Evans  R. Kelly, Self-Regulation in the Alcohol Industry (Sept. 1999); Grube  Wallack, Television Beer Advertising and Drinking Knowledge, Beliefs, and Intentions among Schoolchildren, 84 Am. J. Pub. Health 254 (1994). Not surprisingly, there is considerable evidence that exposure to alcohol advertising is associated with underage drinking. See Atkin, Survey and Experimental Research on Effects of Alcohol Advertising, in The Effects of the Mass Media on the Use and Abuse of Alcohol 39 (S. Martin ed. 1995); Madden  Grube, The Frequency and Nature of Alcohol and Tobacco Advertising in Televised Sports, 1990 through 1992, 84 Am. J. Pub. Health 297 (1994).~    ~    ~      156~      Like underage tobacco use, underage drinking has effects that cannot be undone later in life. Those who begin drinking early are much more likely to become dependent on alcohol. Indeed, the probability of lifetime alcohol dependence decreases approximately 14 percent with each additional year of age at which alcohol is first used. Grant  Dawson, Age at Onset of Alcohol Use and its Association with DSM-IV Alcohol Abuse and Dependence, 9 J. Substance Abuse 103, 108 (1997). And obviously the effects of underage drinking are irreversible for the nearly 1,700 Americans killed each year by teenage drunk drivers. See National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 1998 Youth Fatal Crash and Alcohol Facts.~    ~    ~      157~      Respondents have identified no principle of law or logic that would preclude the imposition of restrictions on fast food and alcohol advertising similar to those they seek to impose on tobacco advertising. Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 56-57. In effect, they seek a \"vice\" exception to the First Amendment. No such exception exists. See 44 Liquormart, 517 U.S., at 513-514 (opinion of Stevens, J., joined by Kennedy, Thomas, and Ginsburg, JJ.). If it did, it would have almost no limit, for \"any product that poses some threat to public health or public morals might reasonably be characterized by a state legislature as relating to 'vice activity.' \" Id., at 514. That is why \"a 'vice' label that is unaccompanied by a corresponding prohibition against the commercial behavior at issue fails to provide a principled justification for the regulation of commercial speech about that activity.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      158~      No legislature has ever sought to restrict speech about an activity it regarded as harmless and inoffensive. Calls for limits on expression always are made when the specter of some threatened harm is looming. The identity of the harm may vary. People will be inspired by totalitarian dogmas and subvert the Republic. They will be inflamed by racial demagoguery and embrace hatred and bigotry. Or they will be enticed by cigarette advertisements and choose to smoke, risking disease. It is therefore no answer for the State to say that the makers of cigarettes are doing harm: perhaps they are. But in that respect they are no different from the purveyors of other harmful products, or the advocates of harmful ideas. When the State seeks to silence them, they are all entitled to the protection of the First Amendment.~    ~    ~      ~        Notes:~      ~      ~        1~         Other regulations prohibit the sale of tobacco products \"in any manner other than in a direct, face-to-face exchange,\" forbid self-service displays, and require that tobacco products be accessible only to store personnel. See 21.04(2)(a), (c)-(d), 22.06(2)(a), (c)-(d). In addition, they prohibit sampling and promotional giveaways. See 21.04(1), 22.06(1). I agree with the Court, see ante, at 38-41, that these regulations, which govern conduct rather than expression, should be upheld under the test of United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968).~      ~      ~        2~         Tobacco advertising provides a good illustration. The sale of tobacco products is the subject of considerable political controversy, and not surprisingly, some tobacco advertisements both promote a product and take a stand in this political debate. See Brief for National Association of Convenience Stores as Amicus Curiae 20-22. A recent cigarette advertisement, for example, displayed a brand logo next to text reading, \"Why do politicians smoke cigars while taxing cigarettes?\" App. to Brief for National Association of Convenience Stores as Amicus Curiae 2a.~      ~      ~        3~         This is not to say that the regulation does nothing at all. As the Court points out, see ante, at 35, security concerns require that convenience stores be designed so that the interior of the store is visible from the street. See also Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Recommendations for Workplace Violence Prevention Programs in Late-Night Retail Establishments 6 (1998) (\"Shelves should be low enough to assure good visibility throughout the store\"). The 21.04(5)(b) ban on displays below five feet and the 21.04(5)(a) ban on displays visible from outside the store, combined with these security concerns, would prevent many convenience stores from displaying any tobacco products at all. Thus, despite the State's disclaimers, see Brief for Respondents 30 (\"The State, quite clearly, is not trying to suppress altogether the communication of product information to interested consumers\"), the restrictions effectively produce a total ban.~      ~    ~    ~      159~      Justice Souter, concurring in part and dissenting in part.~    ~    ~      160~      I join Parts I, II-C, II-D, III-A, III-B-1, III-C, and III-D of the Court's opinion. I join Part I of the opinion of Justice Stevens concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part. I respectfully dissent from Part III-B-2 of the opinion of the Court, and like Justice Stevens would remand for trial on the constitutionality of the 1,000-foot limit.~    ~    ~      161~      Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer join, and with whom Justice Souter joins as to Part I, concurring in part, concurring in the judgment in part, and dissenting in part.~    ~    ~      162~      This suit presents two separate sets of issues. The first-involving preemption-is straightforward. The second-involving the First Amendment-is more complex. Because I strongly disagree with the Court's conclusion that the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965 (FCLAA or Act), 15 U.S.C.  1331 et seq. as amended, precludes States and localities from regulating the location of cigarette advertising, I dissent from Parts II-A and II-B of the Court's opinion. On the First Amendment questions, I agree with the Court both that the outdoor advertising restrictions imposed by Massachusetts serve legitimate and important state interests and that the record does not indicate that the measures were properly tailored to serve those interests. Because the present record does not enable us to adjudicate the merits of those claims on summary judgment, I would vacate the decision upholding those restrictions and remand for trial on the constitutionality of the outdoor advertising regulations. Finally, because I do not believe that either the point-of-sale advertising restrictions or the sales practice restrictions implicate significant First Amendment concerns, I would uphold them in their entirety.~    ~    ~      163~      * As the majority acknowledges, ante, at 11, under prevailing principles, any examination of the scope of a preemption provision must \" 'start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States [are] not to be superseded by ... Federal Act unless that [is] the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.' \" Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U.S. 504, 516 (1992) (quoting Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947)); see also, e.g., California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham Constr., N. A., Inc., 519 U.S. 316, 325 (1997); Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.S. 470, 475 (1996). As the regulations at issue in this suit implicate two powers that lie at the heart of the States' traditional police power-the power to regulate land usage and the power to protect the health and safety of minors-our precedents require that the Court construe the preemption provision \"narrow[ly].\" Id., at 485; see also Cippolone, 505 U.S., at 518. If Congress' intent to preempt a particular category of regulation is ambiguous, such regulations are not preempted.1~    ~    ~      164~      The text of the preemption provision must be viewed in context, with proper attention paid to the history, structure, and purpose of the regulatory scheme in which it appears. See, e.g., Medtronic, 518 U.S., at 484-486; New York State Conference of Blue Cross  Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U.S. 645, 655-656 (1995); Cippolone, 505 U.S., at 513-515, 519-520, 529, 530, n.27; accord, ante, at 11-12.2 An assessment of the scope of a preemption provision must give effect to a \"reasoned understanding of the way in which Congress intended the statute and its surrounding regulatory scheme to affect business, consumers, and the law.\" Medtronic, 518 U.S., at 486.~    ~    ~      165~      This task, properly performed, leads inexorably to the conclusion that Congress did not intend to preempt state and local regulations of the location of cigarette advertising when it adopted the provision at issue in this suit. In both 1965 and 1969, Congress made clear the purposes of its regulatory endeavor, explaining with precision the federal policies motivating its actions. According to the acts, Congress adopted a \"comprehensive Federal program to deal with cigarette labeling and advertising with respect to any relationship between smoking and health,\" for two reasons: (1) to inform the public that smoking may be hazardous to health and (2) to ensure that commerce and the interstate economy not be \"impeded by diverse, nonuniform, and confusing cigarette labeling and advertising regulations with respect to any relationship between smoking and health.\" 15 U.S.C.  1331.~    ~    ~      166~      In order to serve the second purpose it was necessary to preempt state regulation of the content of both cigarette labels and cigarette advertising. If one State required the inclusion of a particular warning on the package of cigarettes while another State demanded a different formulation, cigarette manufacturers would have been forced into the difficult and costly practice of producing different packaging for use in different States. To foreclose the waste of resources that would be entailed by such a patchwork regulatory system, Congress expressly precluded other regulators from requiring the placement on cigarette packaging of any \"statement relating to smoking and health.\" 1334(a). Similar concerns applied to cigarette advertising. If different regulatory bodies required that different warnings or statements be used when cigarette manufacturers advertised their products, the text and layout of a company's ads would have had to differ from locale to locale. The resulting costs would have come with little or no health benefit. Moreover, given the nature of publishing, it might well have been the case that cigarette companies would not have been able to advertise in national publications without violating the laws of some jurisdictions. In response to these concerns, Congress adopted a parallel provision preempting state and local regulations requiring inclusion in cigarette advertising of any \"statement relating to smoking and health.\" 1334(b) (1970 ed.) (amended 1970).~    ~    ~      167~      There was, however, no need to interfere with state or local zoning laws or other regulations prescribing limitations on the location of signs or billboards. Laws prohibiting a cigarette company from hanging a billboard near a school in Boston in no way conflict with laws permitting the hanging of such a billboard in other jurisdictions. Nor would such laws even impose a significant administrative burden on would-be advertisers, as the great majority of localities impose general restrictions on signage, thus requiring advertisers to examine local law before posting signs whether or not cigarette-specific laws are preempted. See Greater N. Y. Metroploitan Food Council, Inc. v. Giuliani, 195 F.3d 100, 109 (CA2 1999) (\"Divergent local zoning restrictions on the location of sign advertising are a commonplace feature of the national landscape and cigarette advertisers have always been bound to observe them\"). Hence, it is unsurprising that Congress did not include any provision in the 1965 Act preempting location restrictions.~    ~    ~      168~      The Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969 (1969 Act), 2, 84 Stat. 87, made two important changes in the preemption provision. First, it limited the applicability of the advertising prong to States and localities, paving the way for further federal regulation of cigarette advertising. FCLAA., 4. Second, it expanded the scope of the advertising preemption provision. Where previously States were prohibited from requiring particular statements in cigarette advertising based on health concerns, they would henceforth be prohibited from imposing any \"requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health ... with respect to the advertising or promotion\" of cigarettes. 5(b), 15 U.S.C.  1334(b).3~    ~    ~      169~      Ripped from its context, this provision could theoretically be read as a breathtaking expansion of the limitations imposed by the 1965 Act. However, both our precedents and common sense require us to read statutory provisions-and, in particular, preemption clauses-in the context of both their neighboring provisions and of the history and purpose of the statutory scheme. See supra, at 3. When so viewed, it is quite clear that the 1969 amendments were intended to expand the provision to capture a narrow set of content regulations that would have escaped preemption under the prior provision, not to fundamentally reorder the division of regulatory authority between the Federal and State Governments.~    ~    ~      170~      All signs point inescapably to the conclusion that Congress only intended to preempt content regulations in the 1969 Act. It is of crucial importance that, in making modifications of the preemption provision, Congress did not alter the statement laying out the federal policies the provision was intended to serve. See 15 U.S.C.  1331. To this day, the stated federal policies in this area are (1) to inform the public of the dangers of cigarette smoking and (2) to protect the cigarette companies from the burdens of confusing and contradictory state regulations of their labels and advertisements. See ibid. The retention of this provision unchanged is strong evidence that Congress' only intention in expanding the preemption clause was to capture forms of content regulation that had fallen through the cracks of the prior provision-for example, state laws prohibiting cigarette manufacturers from making particular claims in their advertising or requiring them to utilize specified layouts or include particular graphics in their marketing.4~    ~    ~      171~      The legislative history of the provision also supports such a reading. The record does not contain any evidence that Congress intended to expand the scope of preemption beyond content restrictions.5 To the contrary, the Senate Report makes it clear that the changes merely \"clarified\" the scope of the original provision. S. Rep. No. 91-566, p. 12 (1969). Even as amended, Congress perceived the provision as \"narrowly phrased\" and emphasized that its purpose is to \"avoid the chaos created by a multiplicity of conflicting regulations.\" Ibid. According to the Senate Report, the changes \"in no way affect the power of any state or political subdivision of any state with respect to ... the sale of cigarettes to minors ...or similar police regulations.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      172~      In analyzing the scope of the preemption provision, the Courts of Appeals have almost uniformly concluded that state and local laws regulating the location of billboards and signs are not preempted. See Consolidated Cigar Corp. v. Reilly, 218 F.3d 30, 39-41 (CA1 2000) (case below); Greater New York Metropolitan Food Council, Inc. v. Giuliani, 195 F.3d 100, 104-110 (CA2 1999); Federation of Advertising Industry Representatives, Inc. v. Chicago, 189 F.3d 633, 636-640 (CA7 1999); Penn Advertising of Baltimore, Inc. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 63 F.3d 1318 (CA4 1995); contra Lindsey v. Tacoma-Pierce County Health Dept, 195 F.3d 1065 (CA9 1999). The decisions in those cases relied heavily upon our discussion of the same preemption provision in Cipollone, 505 U.S., at 515-524. In Cipollone, while the Members of the Court expressed three different opinions concerning the scope of preemption mandated by the provision, those differences related entirely to which, if any, of the plaintiff's claims based on the content of the defendants' advertising were preempted by 5. Nary a word in any of the three Cipollone opinions supports the thesis that 5 should be interpreted to preempt state regulation of the location of signs advertising cigarettes. Indeed, seven of the nine Justices subscribed to opinions that explicitly tethered the scope of the preemption provision to Congress' concern with \"diverse, nonuniform, and confusing cigarette labeling and advertising regulations.\" Id., at 519; id., at 534, 541 (opinion of Blackmun, J., joined by Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.).~    ~    ~      173~      I am firmly convinced that, when Congress amended the preemption provision in 1969, it did not intend to expand the application of the provision beyond content regulations.6 I, therefore, find the conclusion inescapable that the zoning regulation at issue in this suit is not a \"requirement or prohibition ... with respect to ... advertising\" within the meaning of the 1969 Act.7 Even if I were not so convinced, however, I would still dissent from the Court's conclusion with regard to preemption, because the provision is, at the very least, ambiguous. The historical record simply does not reflect that it was Congress' \" 'clear and manifest purpose,' \" Id., at 516, to preempt attempts by States to utilize their traditional zoning authority to protect the health and welfare of minors. Absent such a manifest purpose, Massachusetts and its sister States retain their traditional police powers.8~    ~    II~    ~      174~      On the First Amendment issues raised by petitioners, my disagreements with the majority are less significant. I would, however, reach different dispositions as to the 1,000-foot rule and the height restrictions for indoor advertising, and my evaluation of the sales practice restrictions differs from the Court's. The 1,000-Foot Rule~    ~    ~      175~      I am in complete accord with the Court's analysis of the importance of the interests served by the advertising restrictions. As the Court lucidly explains, few interests are more \"compelling,\" ante, at 34, than ensuring that minors do not become addicted to a dangerous drug before they are able to make a mature and informed decision as to the health risks associated with that substance. Unlike other products sold for human consumption, tobacco products are addictive and ultimately lethal for many longnbhyph;term users. When that interest is combined with the State's concomitant concern for the effective enforcement of its laws regarding the sale of tobacco to minors, it becomes clear that Massachusetts' regulations serve interests of the highest order and are, therefore, immune from any ends-based challenge, whatever level of scrutiny one chooses to employ.~    ~    ~      176~      Nevertheless, noble ends do not save a speech-restricting statute whose means are poorly tailored. Such statutes may be invalid for two different reasons. First, the means chosen may be insufficiently related to the ends they purportedly serve. See, e.g., Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U.S. 476 (1995) (striking a statute prohibiting beer labels from displaying alcohol content because the provision did not significantly forward the government's interest in the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens). Alternatively, the statute may be so broadly drawn that, while effectively achieving its ends, it unduly restricts communications that are unrelated to its policy aims. See, e.g., United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 812 (2000) (striking a statute intended to protect children from indecent television broadcasts, in part because it constituted \"a significant restriction of communication between speakers and willing adult listeners\"). The second difficulty is most frequently encountered when government adopts measures for the protection of children that impose substantial restrictions on the ability of adults to communicate with one another. See, e.g., Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., supra; Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.S. 844 (1997); Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989).~    ~    ~      177~      To my mind, the 1,000-foot rule does not present a tailoring problem of the first type. For reasons cogently explained in our prior opinions and in the opinion of the Court, we may fairly assume that advertising stimulates consumption and, therefore, that regulations limiting advertising will facilitate efforts to stem consumption.9 See, e.g., Rubin, 514 U.S., at 487; United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co., 509 U.S. 418, 434 (1993); ante, at 27. Furthermore, if the government's intention is to limit consumption by a particular segment of the community-in this case, minors-it is appropriate, indeed necessary, to tailor advertising restrictions to the areas where that segment of the community congregates-in this case, the area surrounding schools and playgrounds.~    ~    ~      178~      However, I share the majority's concern as to whether the 1,000-foot rule unduly restricts the ability of cigarette manufacturers to convey lawful information to adult consumers. This, of course, is a question of line-drawing. While a ban on all communications about a given subject would be the most effective way to prevent children from exposure to such material, the state cannot by fiat reduce the level of discourse to that which is \"fit for children.\" Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380, 383 (1957); cf. Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U.S. 60, 74 (1983) (\"The level of discourse reaching a mailbox simply cannot be limited to that which would be suitable for a sandbox\"). On the other hand, efforts to protect children from exposure to harmful material will undoubtedly have some spillover effect on the free speech rights of adults. See, e.g., FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726, 749-750, and n. 28 (1978).~    ~    ~      179~      Finding the appropriate balance is no easy matter. Though many factors plausibly enter the equation when calculating whether a child-directed location restriction goes too far in regulating adult speech, one crucial question is whether the regulatory scheme leaves available sufficient \"alternative avenues of communication.\" Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 50 (1986); Members of City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 819 (1984) (Brennan, J., dissenting); accord ante, at 33. Because I do not think the record contains sufficient information to enable us to answer that question, I would vacate the award of summary judgment upholding the 1,000-foot rule and remand for trial on that issue. Therefore, while I agree with the majority that the Court of Appeals did not sufficiently consider the implications of the 1,000-foot rule for the lawful communication of adults, see ante, at 31-36, I dissent from the disposition reflected in Part III-B-2 of the Court's opinion.~    ~    ~      180~      There is no doubt that the 1,000-foot rule prohibits cigarette advertising in a substantial portion of Massachusetts' largest cities. Even on that question, however, the parties remain in dispute as to the percentage of these urban areas that is actually off limits to tobacco advertising. See ante, at 32. Moreover, the record is entirely silent on the impact of the regulation in other portions of the Commonwealth. The dearth of reliable statistical information as to the scope of the ban is problematic.~    ~    ~      181~      More importantly, the Court lacks sufficient qualitative information as to the areas where cigarette advertising is prohibited and those where it is permitted. The fact that 80% or 90% of an urban area is unavailable to tobacco advertisements may be constitutionally irrelevant if the available areas are so heavily trafficked or so central to the city's cultural life that they provide a sufficient forum for the propagation of a manufacturer's message. One electric sign in Times Square or at the foot of the Golden Gate Bridge may be seen by more potential customers than a hundred signs dispersed in residential neighborhoods.~    ~    ~      182~      Finally, the Court lacks information as to other avenues of communication available to cigarette manufacturers and retailers. For example, depending on the answers to empirical questions on which we lack data, the ubiquity of print advertisements hawking particular brands of cigarettes might suffice to inform adult consumers of the special advantages of the respective brands. Similarly, print advertisements, circulars mailed to people's homes, word of mouth, and general information may or may not be sufficient to imbue the adult population with the knowledge that particular stores, chains of stores, or types of stores sell tobacco products.10~    ~    ~      183~      In granting summary judgment for the respondents, the District Judge treated the First Amendment issues in this suit as pure questions of law and stated that \"there are no material facts in dispute concerning these issues.\" 84 F. Supp. 2d, at 183. With due respect, I disagree. While the ultimate question before us is one of law, the answer to that question turns on complicated factual questions relating to the practical effects of the regulations. As the record does not reveal the answer to these disputed questions of fact, the court should have denied summary judgment to both parties and allowed the parties to present further evidence.~    ~    ~      184~      I note, moreover, that the alleged \"overinclusivity\" of the advertising regulations, ante, at 8, (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), while relevant to whether the regulations are narrowly tailored, does not \"beli[e]\" the claim that tobacco advertising imagery misleads children into believing that smoking is healthy, glamorous, or sophisticated, ibid. See Brief of Amicus Curiae American Legacy Foundation in Support of Respondent 4-5 and nn. 9, 10; Brief of Amicus Curiae City of Los Angeles in Support of Respondent 4 (documenting charge that advertisements for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco target underage smokers). For purposes of summary judgment, the State conceded that the tobacco companies' advertising concerns lawful activity and is not misleading. Under the Court's disposition of the case today, the State remains free to proffer evidence that the advertising is in fact misleading. See Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 748, 771 (1976) (\"[M]uch commercial speech is not provably false, or even wholly false, but only deceptive or misleading. We foresee no obstacle to a State's dealing effectively with this problem\"). I would vacate the grant of summary judgment to respondents on this issue and remand for further proceedings. The Sales Practice and Indoor Advertising Restrictions~    ~    ~      185~      After addressing petitioners' challenge to the sales practice restrictions imposed by the Massachusetts statute, the Court concluded that these provisions did not violate the First Amendment. I concur in that judgment, but write separately on this issue to make two brief points.~    ~    ~      186~      First, I agree with the District Court and the Court of Appeals that the sales practice restrictions are best analyzed as regulating conduct, not speech. See 218 F.3d, at 53. While the decision how to display one's products no doubt serves a marginal communicative function, the same can be said of virtually any human activity performed with the hope or intention of evoking the interest of others. This Court has long recognized the need to differentiate between legislation that targets expression and legislation that targets conduct for legitimate non-speech-related reasons but imposes an incidental burden on expression. See, e.g., United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968). However difficult that line may be to draw, it seems clear to me that laws requiring that stores maintain items behind counters and prohibiting self-service displays fall squarely on the conduct side of the line. Restrictions as to the accessibility of dangerous or legally-restricted products are a common feature of the regulatory regime governing American retail stores. I see nothing the least bit constitutionally problematic in requiring individuals to ask for the assistance of a salesclerk in order to examine or purchase a handgun, a bottle of penicillin, or a package of cigarettes.~    ~    ~      187~      Second, though I admit the question is closer, I would, for similar reasons, uphold the regulation limiting tobacco advertising in certain retail establishments to the space five feet or more above the floor.11 When viewed in isolation, this provision appears to target speech. Further, to the extent that it does target speech it may well run into constitutional problems, as the connection between the ends the statute purports to serve and the means it has chosen are dubious. Nonetheless, I am ultimately persuaded that the provision is unobjectionable because it is little more than an adjunct to the other sales practice restrictions. As the Commonwealth of Massachusetts can properly legislate the placement of products and the nature of displays in its convenience stores, I would not draw a distinction between such restrictions and height restrictions on related product advertising. I would accord the Commonwealth some latitude in imposing restrictions that can have only the slightest impact on the ability of adults to purchase a poisonous product and may save some children from taking the first step on the road to addiction.~    ~    III~    ~      188~      Because I strongly disagree with the Court's conclusion on the preemption issue, I dissent from Parts II-A and II-B of its opinion. Though I agree with much of what the Court has to say about the First Amendment, I ultimately disagree with its disposition or its reasoning on each of the regulations before us.12~    ~    ~      ~        Notes:~      ~      ~        1~         See, e.g., Florida Lime  Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U.S. 132, 146-147 (1963) (\"[W]e are not to conclude that Congress legislated the ouster of this [state] statute ... in the absence of an unambiguous congressional mandate to that effect\"); Cippolone, 505 U.S., at 533 (Blackmun, J., joined by Kennedy and Souter, JJ., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part) (\"The principles of federalism and respect for state sovereignty that underlie the Court's reluctance to find pre-emption where Congress has not spoken directly to the issue apply with equal force where Congress has spoken, though ambiguously. In such cases, the question is not whether Congress intended to pre-empt state regulation, but to what extent. We do not, absent unambiguous evidence, infer a scope of pre-emption beyond that which clearly is mandated by Congress' language\" (emphasis deleted)).~      ~      ~        2~         Cf. Central Hanover Bank  Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 159 F.2d 167, 169 (CA2 1947) (L. Hand, J.) (\"There is no more likely way to misapprehend the meaning of language-be it in a constitution, a statute, a will or a contract-than to read the words literally, forgetting the object which the document as a whole is meant to secure\").~      ~      ~        3~         In Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U.S. 504, 521 (1992), we held that one of the consequences of this change in language was that after 1969 the statute preempts some common-law actions.~      ~      ~        4~         Because of the nature of magazine publishing and distribution, it is conceivable that a State or locality might cause the kind of regulatory confusion the statute was drafted to prevent by adopting a law prohibiting the advertising of cigarettes in any publication distributed within its boundaries. There is at least a modicum of support for the suggestion that Congress may have intended the preemption of such restrictions. See id., at 515, n. 11 (noting that California was considering such a ban at the time Congress was considering the 1969 Act). However, the concerns posed by the diverse regulation of national publications are not present with regard to the local regulation of the location of signs and billboards.~      ~      ~        5~         At one point, the Court briefly argues that it would be wrong to conclude that Congress intended to preclude only content restrictions, because it imposed a location restriction (a ban on television and radio advertising) in another provision of the same bill. See ante, at 18. This argument is something of a non sequitur. The fact that Congress, in adopting a comprehensive legislative package, chose to impose a federal location restriction for a national medium has no bearing on whether, in a separate provision, the Legislature intended to strip States and localities of the authority to impose location restrictions for purely local advertising media.~      ~      ~        6~           Petitioners suggest in passing that Massachusetts' regulation amounts to a \"near-total ba[n],\" Brief for Petitioners Lorillard Tobacco Co. et al. 22, and thus is a de facto regulation of the content of cigarette ads. But we need not consider today the circumstances in which location restrictions approximating a total ban might constitute regulation of content and thus be preempted by the Act, because petitioners have failed to introduce sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue as to that claim. Petitioners introduced maps purporting to show that cigarette advertising is barred in 90.6% of Boston proper, 87.8% of Worcester, and 88.8% of Springfield. See App. 165-167. But the maps do not distinguish between the area restricted due to the regulation at issue here and the area restricted due to pre-existing regulations, such as general zoning requirements applicable to all outdoor advertising. Nor do the maps show the percentage (with respect to either area or population) of the State that is off limits to cigarette advertising; they cover only three cities containing approximately 14% of the State's population. See U.S. Census Bureau, Statistical Abstract of the United States 28, 47, 49 (1999) (providing population figures for 1998). The area in which cigarette advertising is restricted is likely to be considerably less in less densely populated portions of the State. And even on the interpretation of this data most favorable to petitioners, the Massachusetts regulation still permits indoor and outdoor cigarette advertising in at least 10% of the geographical area of the State. In short, the regulation here is not the equivalent of a total ban on cigarette advertising.~      ~      ~        7~         Hence, while I agree in large part with the substance of the arguments proffered by the respondents and the United States on the preemption issue, I reject their conclusion that the content/location distinction finds expression in the limiting phrase \"based on smoking and health.\" See Brief for Respondent 20; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 5; accord Penn Advertising of Baltimore, Inc. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 63 F.3d 1318 (CA4 1995). Instead, I would follow the First, Second, and Seventh Circuits in concluding that a statute regulating the location of advertising is not a \"requirement or prohibition ... with respect to ... advertising\" within the meaning of the 1969 Act. See Consolidated Cigar Corp. v. Reilly, 218 F.3d 30, 39-41 (CA1 2000) (case below); Greater N.Y. Metropolitan Food Council, Inc. v. Giuliani, 195 F.3d 100, 104-110 (CA2 1999); Federation of Advertising Industry Representatives, Inc. v. Chicago, 189 F.3d 633, 636-640 (CA7 1999).~      ~      ~        8~         The Court's holding that federal law precludes States and localities from protecting children from dangerous products within 1,000 feet of a school is particularly ironic given the Court's conclusion six years ago that the Federal Government lacks the constitutional authority to impose a similarly-motivated ban. See United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995). Despite the absence of any identified federal interest in creating \"an invisible federal zone extending 1,000 feet beyond the (often irregular) boundaries of the school property,\" as the majority construes it today, the \"statute now before us forecloses the States from experimenting and exercising their own judgment in an area to which States lay claim by right of history and expertise,\" id., at 583 (Kennedy, J., concurring). I wonder why a Court sensitive to federalism concerns would adopt such a strange construction of statutory language whose quite different purpose Congress took pains to explain.~      ~      ~        9~         Moreover, even if it were our practice to require a particularized showing of the effects of advertising on consumption, the respondents have met that burden in this suit.

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.ANTHONY PALAZZOLO, PETITIONERv.RHODE ISLAND et al.~    No. 99-2047.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued February 26, 2001Decided June 28, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      In order to acquire the waterfront parcel of Rhode Island land that is here at issue, petitioner and associates formed Shore Gardens, Inc. (SGI), in 1959. After SGI purchased the property petitioner bought out his associates and became the sole shareholder. Most of the property was then, and is now, salt marsh subject to tidal flooding. The wet ground and permeable soil would require considerable fill before significant structures could be built. Over the years, SGI's intermittent applications to develop the property were rejected by various government agencies. After 1966, no further applications were made for over a decade. Two intervening events, however, become important to the issues presented. First, in 1971, the State created respondent Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council (Council) and charged it with protecting the State's coastal properties. The Council's regulations, known as the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Program (CRMP), designated salt marshes like those on SGI's property as protected \"coastal wetlands\" on which development is greatly limited. Second, in 1978 SGI's corporate charter was revoked, and title to the property passed to petitioner as the corporation's sole shareholder. In 1983 petitioner applied to the Council for permission to construct a wooden bulkhead and fill his entire marsh land area. The Council rejected the application, concluding, inter alia, that it would conflict with the CRMP. In 1985 petitioner filed a new application with the Council, seeking permission to fill 11 of the property's 18 wetland acres in order to build a private beach club. The Council rejected this application as well, ruling that the proposal did not satisfy the standards for obtaining a \"special exception\" to fill salt marsh, whereby the proposed activity must serve a compelling public purpose. Subsequently, petitioner filed an inverse condemnation action in Rhode Island Superior Court, asserting that the State's wetlands regulations, as applied by the Council to his parcel, had taken the property without compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The suit alleged the Council's action deprived him of \"all economically beneficial use\" of his property, resulting in a total taking requiring compensation under Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, and sought $3,150,000 in damages, a figure derived from an appraiser's estimate as to the value of a 74-lot residential subdivision on the property. The court ruled against petitioner, and the State Supreme Court affirmed, holding that (1) petitioner's takings claim was not ripe; (2) he had no right to challenge regulations predating 1978, when he succeeded to legal ownership of the property; (3) he could not assert a takings claim based on the denial of all economic use of his property in light of undisputed evidence that he had $200,000 in development value remaining on an upland parcel of the property; and (4) because the regulation at issue predated his acquisition of title, he could have had no reasonable investment-backed expectation that he could develop his property, and, therefore, he could not recover under Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 124 Held:~      1. This case is ripe for review. Pp. 8-16.~      (a) A takings claim challenging application of land-use regulations is not ripe unless the agency charged with implementing the regulations has reached a final decision regarding their application to the property at issue. Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U.S. 172, 186. A final decision does not occur until the responsible agency determines the extent of permitted development on the land. MacDonald, Sommer  Frates v. Yolo County, 477 U.S. 340, 351. Petitioner obtained such a final decision when the Council denied his 1983 and 1985 applications. The State Supreme Court erred in ruling that, notwithstanding those denials, doubt remained as to the extent of development the Council would allow on petitioner's parcel due to his failure to explore other uses for the property that would involve filling substantially less wetlands. This is belied by the unequivocal nature of the wetland regulations at issue and by the Council's application of the regulations to the subject property. The CRMP permits the Council to grant a special exception to engage in a prohibited use only where a \"compelling public purpose\" is served. The proposal to fill the entire property was not accepted under Council regulations and did not qualify for the special exception. The Council determined the use proposed in the second application (the beach club) did not satisfy the \"compelling public purpose\" standard. There is no indication the Council would have accepted the application had the proposed club occupied a smaller surface area. To the contrary, it ruled that the proposed activity was not a \"compelling public purpose.\" Although a landowner may not establish a taking before the land-use authority has the opportunity, using its own reasonable procedures, to decide and explain the reach of a challenged regulation, e.g., MacDonald, supra, at 342, once it becomes clear that the permissible uses of the property are known to a reasonable degree of certainty, a takings claim is likely to have ripened. Here, the Council's decisions make plain that it interpreted its regulations to bar petitioner from engaging in any filling or development on the wetlands. Further permit applications were not necessary to establish this point. Pp. 8-12.~      (b) Contrary to the State Supreme Court's ruling, petitioner's claim is not unripe by virtue of his failure to seek permission for a use of the property that would involve development only of its upland portion. It is true that there was uncontested testimony that an upland site would have an estimated value of $200,000 if developed. And, while the CRMP requires Council approval to develop upland property lying within 200 feet of protected waters, the strict \"compelling public purpose\" test does not govern proposed land uses on property in this classification. Council officials testified at trial, moreover, that they would have allowed petitioner to build a residence on the upland parcel. Nevertheless, this Court's ripeness jurisprudence requires petitioner to explore development opportunities on his upland parcel only if there is uncertainty as to the land's permitted use. The State's assertion that the uplands' value is in doubt comes too late for the litigation before this Court. It was stated in the certiorari petition that the uplands were worth an estimated $200,000. The figure not only was uncontested but also was cited as fact in the State's brief in opposition. In this circumstance ripeness cannot be contested by saying that the value of the nonwetland parcels is unknown. See Lucas, supra, at 1020, and n. 9. Nor is there genuine ambiguity in the record as to the extent of permitted development on petitioner's property, either on the wetlands or the uplands. Pp. 12-14.~      (c) Nor is petitioner's takings claim rendered unripe, as the State Supreme Court held, by his failure to apply for permission to develop the 74-lot subdivision that was the basis for the damages sought in his inverse condemnation suit. It is difficult to see how this concern is relevant to the inquiry at issue here. The Council informed petitioner that he could not fill the wetlands; it follows of necessity that he could not fill and then build 74 single-family dwellings there. Petitioner's submission of this proposal would not have clarified the extent of development permitted by the wetlands regulations, which is the inquiry required under the Court's ripeness decisions. Pp. 14-16.~      2. Petitioner's acquisition of title after the regulations' effective date did not bar his takings claims. This Court rejects the State Supreme Court's sweeping rule that a purchaser or a successive title holder like petitioner is deemed to have notice of an earlier-enacted restriction and is barred from claiming that it effects a taking. Were the Court to accept that rule, the postenactment transfer of title would absolve the State of its obligation to defend any action restricting land use, no matter how extreme or unreasonable. A State would be allowed, in effect, to put an expiration date on the Takings Clause. This ought not to be the rule. Future generations, too, have a right to challenge unreasonable limitations on the use and value of land. The State's notice justification does not take into account the effect on owners at the time of enactment, who are prejudiced as well. Should an owner attempt to challenge a new regulation, but not survive the process of ripening his or her claim (which, as this case demonstrates, will often take years), under the State's rule the right to compensation may not by asserted by an heir or successor, and so may not be asserted at all. The State's rule also would work a critical alteration to the nature of property, as the newly regulated landowner is stripped of the ability to transfer the interest which was possessed prior to the regulation. The State may not by this means secure a windfall for itself. See, e.g., Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U.S. 155, 164. The rule is, furthermore, capricious in effect. The young owner contrasted with the older owner, the owner with the resources to hold contrasted with the owner with the need to sell, would be in different positions. The Takings Clause is not so quixotic. A blanket rule that purchasers with notice have no compensation right when a claim becomes ripe is too blunt an instrument to accord with the duty to compensate for what is taken. Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, 483 U.S. 825, 834, n. 2, is controlling precedent for the Court's conclusion. Lucas, supra, at 1029, did not overrule Nollan, which is based on essential Takings Clause principles. On remand the state court must address the merits of petitioner's Penn Central claim, which is not barred by the mere fact that his title was acquired after the effective date of the state-imposed restriction. Pp. 16-21.~      3. The State Supreme Court did not err in finding that petitioner failed to establish a deprivation of all economic use, for it is undisputed that his parcel retains significant development value. Petitioner is correct that, assuming a taking is otherwise established, a State may not evade the duty to compensate on the premise that the landowner is left with a token interest. This is not the situation in this case, however. A regulation permitting a landowner to build a substantial residence on an 18-acre parcel does not leave the property \"economically idle.\" Lucas, supra, at 1019. Petitioner attempts to revive this part of his claim by arguing, for the first time, that the upland parcel is distinct from the wetlands portions, so he should be permitted to assert a deprivation limited to the latter. The Court will not explore the point here. Petitioner did not press the argument in the state courts, and the issue was not presented in his certiorari petition. The case comes to the Court on the premise that petitioner's entire parcel serves as the basis for his takings claim, and, so framed, the total deprivation argument fails. Pp. 21-23.~      4. Because petitioner's claims under the Penn Central analysis were not examined below, the case is remanded. Pp. 7, 22. 746 A. 2d 707, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF RHODE ISLAND~      Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor, Scalia, and Thomas, JJ., joined, and in which Stevens, J., joined as to Part II-A.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      Petitioner Anthony Palazzolo owns a waterfront parcel of land in the town of Westerly, Rhode Island. Almost all of the property is designated as coastal wetlands under Rhode Island law. After petitioner's development proposals were rejected by respondent Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council (Council), he sued in state court, asserting the Council's application of its wetlands regulations took the property without compensation in violation of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, binding upon the State through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Petitioner sought review in this Court, contending the Supreme Court of Rhode Island erred in rejecting his takings claim. We granted certiorari. 531 U.S. 923 (2000).~    ~    ~      2~      * The town of Westerly is on an edge of the Rhode Island coastline. The town's western border is the Pawcatuck River, which at that point is the boundary between Rhode Island and Connecticut. Situated on land purchased from the Narragansett Indian Tribe, the town was incorporated in 1669 and had a precarious, though colorful, early history. Both Connecticut and Massachusetts contested the boundaries-and indeed the validity-of Rhode Island's royal charter; and Westerly's proximity to Connecticut invited encroachments during these jurisdictional squabbles. See M. Best, The Town that Saved a State-Westerly 60-83 (1943); see also W. McLaughlin, Rhode Island: A Bicentennial History 39-57 (1978). When the borders of the Rhode Island Colony were settled by compact in 1728, the town's development was more orderly, and with some historical distinction. For instance, Watch Hill Point, the peninsula at the southwestern tip of the town, was of strategic importance in the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. See Best, supra, at 190; F. Denison, Westerly and its Witnesses 118-119 (1878).~    ~    ~      3~      In later times Westerly's coastal location had a new significance: It became a popular vacation and seaside destination. One of the town's historians gave this happy account:~    ~    ~      4~      \"After the Civil War the rapid growth of manufacture and expansion of trade had created a spending class on pleasure bent, and Westerly had superior attractions to offer, surf bathing on ocean beaches, quieter bathing in salt and fresh water ponds, fishing, annual sail and later motor boat races. The broad beaches of clean white sand dip gently toward the sea; there are no odorous marshes at low tide, no railroad belches smoke, and the climate is unrivalled on the coast, that of Newport only excepted. In the phenomenal heat wave of 1881 ocean resorts from northern New England to southern New Jersey sweltered as the thermometer climbed to 95 and 104 degrees, while Watch Hill enjoyed a comfortable 80. When Providence to the north runs a temperature of 90, the mercury in this favored spot remains at 77.\" Best, supra, at 192. Westerly today has about 20,000 year-round residents, and thousands of summer visitors come to enjoy its beaches and coastal advantages.~    ~    ~      5~      One of the more popular attractions is Misquamicut State Beach, a lengthy expanse of coastline facing Block Island Sound and beyond to the Atlantic Ocean. The primary point of access to the beach is Atlantic Avenue, a well-traveled 3-mile stretch of road running along the coastline within the town's limits. At its western end, Atlantic Avenue is something of a commercial strip, with restaurants, hotels, arcades, and other typical seashore businesses. The pattern of development becomes more residential as the road winds eastward onto a narrow spine of land bordered to the south by the beach and the ocean, and to the north by Winnapaug Pond, an intertidal inlet often used by residents for boating, fishing, and shellfishing.~    ~    ~      6~      In 1959 petitioner, a lifelong Westerly resident, decided to invest in three undeveloped, adjoining parcels along this eastern stretch of Atlantic Avenue. To the north, the property faces, and borders upon, Winnapaug Pond; the south of the property faces Atlantic Avenue and the beachfront homes abutting it on the other side, and beyond that the dunes and the beach. To purchase and hold the property, petitioner and associates formed Shore Gardens, Inc. (SGI). After SGI purchased the property petitioner bought out his associates and became the sole shareholder. In the first decade of SGI's ownership of the property the corporation submitted a plat to the town subdividing the property into 80 lots; and it engaged in various transactions that left it with 74 lots, which together encompassed about 20 acres. During the same period SGI also made initial attempts to develop the property and submitted intermittent applications to state agencies to fill substantial portions of the parcel. Most of the property was then, as it is now, salt marsh subject to tidal flooding. The wet ground and permeable soil would require considerable fill-as much as six feet in some places-before significant structures could be built. SGI's proposal, submitted in 1962 to the Rhode Island Division of Harbors and Rivers (DHR), sought to dredge from Winnapaug Pond and fill the entire property. The application was denied for lack of essential information. A second, similar proposal followed a year later. A third application, submitted in 1966 while the second application was pending, proposed more limited filling of the land for use as a private beach club. These latter two applications were referred to the Rhode Island Department of Natural Resources, which indicated initial assent. The agency later withdrew approval, however, citing adverse environmental impacts. SGI did not contest the ruling.~    ~    ~      7~      No further attempts to develop the property were made for over a decade. Two intervening events, however, become important to the issues presented. First, in 1971, Rhode Island enacted legislation creating the Council, an agency charged with the duty of protecting the State's coastal properties. 1971 R. I. Pub. Laws ch. 279, 1 et seq. Regulations promulgated by the Council designated salt marshes like those on SGI's property as protected \"coastal wetlands,\" Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Program (CRMP) 210.3 (as amended, June 28, 1983) (lodged with the Clerk of this Court), on which development is limited to a great extent. Second, in 1978 SGI's corporate charter was revoked for failure to pay corporate income taxes; and title to the property passed, by operation of state law, to petitioner as the corporation's sole shareholder.~    ~    ~      8~      In 1983 petitioner, now the owner, renewed the efforts to develop the property. An application to the Council, resembling the 1962 submission, requested permission to construct a wooden bulkhead along the shore of Winnapaug Pond and to fill the entire marsh land area. The Council rejected the application, noting it was \"vague and inadequate for a project of this size and nature.\" App. 16. The agency also found that \"the proposed activities will have significant impacts upon the waters and wetlands of Winnapaug Pond,\" and concluded that \"the proposed alteration ... will conflict with the Coastal Resources Management Plan presently in effect.\" Id., at 17. Petitioner did not appeal the agency's determination.~    ~    ~      9~      Petitioner went back to the drawing board, this time hiring counsel and preparing a more specific and limited proposal for use of the property. The new application, submitted to the Council in 1985, echoed the 1966 request to build a private beach club. The details do not tend to inspire the reader with an idyllic coastal image, for the proposal was to fill 11 acres of the property with gravel to accommodate \"50 cars with boat trailers, a dumpster, port-a-johns, picnic tables, barbecue pits of concrete, and other trash receptacles.\" Id., at 25.~    ~    ~      10~      The application fared no better with the Council than previous ones. Under the agency's regulations, a landowner wishing to fill salt marsh on Winnapaug Pond needed a \"special exception\" from the Council. CRMP 130. In a short opinion the Council said the beach club proposal conflicted with the regulatory standard for a special exception. See App. 27. To secure a special exception the proposed activity must serve \"a compelling public purpose which provides benefits to the public as a whole as opposed to individual or private interests.\" CRMP 130A(1). This time petitioner appealed the decision to the Rhode Island courts, challenging the Council's conclusion as contrary to principles of state administrative law. The Council's decision was affirmed. See App. 31-42.~    ~    ~      11~      Petitioner filed an inverse condemnation action in Rhode Island Superior Court, asserting that the State's wetlands regulations, as applied by the Council to his parcel, had taken the property without compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. See App. 45. The suit alleged the Council's action deprived him of \"all economically beneficial use\" of his property, ibid., resulting in a total taking requiring compensation under Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003 (1992). He sought damages in the amount of $3,150,000, a figure derived from an appraiser's estimate as to the value of a 74-lot residential subdivision. The State countered with a host of defenses. After a bench trial, a justice of the Superior Court ruled against petitioner, accepting some of the State's theories. App. to Pet. for Cert. B-1 to B-13.~    ~    ~      12~      The Rhode Island Supreme Court affirmed. 746 A. 2d 707 (2000). Like the Superior Court, the State Supreme Court recited multiple grounds for rejecting petitioner's suit. The court held, first, that petitioner's takings claim was not ripe, id., at 712-715; second, that petitioner had no right to challenge regulations predating 1978, when he succeeded to legal ownership of the property from SGI, id., at 716; and third, that the claim of deprivation of all economically beneficial use was contradicted by undisputed evidence that he had $200,000 in development value remaining on an upland parcel of the property, id., at 715. In addition to holding petitioner could not assert a takings claim based on the denial of all economic use the court concluded he could not recover under the more general test of Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104 (1978). On this claim, too, the date of acquisition of the parcel was found determinative, and the court held he could have had \"no reasonable investment-backed expectations that were affected by this regulation\" because it predated his ownership, 746 A. 2d, at 717; see also Penn Central, supra, at 124.~    ~    ~      13~      We disagree with the Supreme Court of Rhode Island as to the first two of these conclusions; and, we hold, the court was correct to conclude that the owner is not deprived of all economic use of his property because the value of upland portions is substantial. We remand for further consideration of the claim under the principles set forth in Penn Central.~    ~    II~    ~      14~      The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, Chicago, B.  Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U.S. 226 (1897), prohibits the government from taking private property for public use without just compensation. The clearest sort of taking occurs when the government encroaches upon or occupies private land for its own proposed use. Our cases establish that even a minimal \"permanent physical occupation of real property\" requires compensation under the Clause. Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 427 (1982). In Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393 (1922), the Court recognized that there will be instances when government actions do not encroach upon or occupy the property yet still affect and limit its use to such an extent that a taking occurs. In Justice Holmes' well-known, if less than self-defining, formulation, \"while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if a regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.\" Id., at 415.~    ~    ~      15~      Since Mahon, we have given some, but not too specific, guidance to courts confronted with deciding whether a particular government action goes too far and effects a regulatory taking. First, we have observed, with certain qualifications, see infra at 19-21, that a regulation which \"denies all economically beneficial or productive use of land\" will require compensation under the Takings Clause. Lucas, 505 U.S., at 1015; see also id., at 1035 (Kennedy, J., concurring); Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U.S. 255, 261 (1980). Where a regulation places limitations on land that fall short of eliminating all economically beneficial use, a taking nonetheless may have occurred, depending on a complex of factors including the regulation's economic effect on the landowner, the extent to which the regulation interferes with reasonable investment-backed expectations, and the character of the government action. Penn Central, supra, at 124. These inquiries are informed by the purpose of the Takings Clause, which is to prevent the government from \"forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.\" Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S. 40, 49 (1960).~    ~    ~      16~      Petitioner seeks compensation under these principles. At the outset, however, we face the two threshold considerations invoked by the state court to bar the claim: ripeness, and acquisition which postdates the regulation.~    ~    ~      17~      * In Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U.S. 172 (1985), the Court explained the requirement that a takings claim must be ripe. The Court held that a takings claim challenging the application of land-use regulations is not ripe unless \"the government entity charged with implementing the regulations has reached a final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue.\" Id., at 186. A final decision by the responsible state agency informs the constitutional determination whether a regulation has deprived a landowner of \"all economically beneficial use\" of the property, see Lucas, supra, at 1015, or defeated the reasonable investment-backed expectations of the landowner to the extent that a taking has occurred, see Penn Central, supra, at 124. These matters cannot be resolved in definitive terms until a court knows \"the extent of permitted development\" on the land in question. MacDonald, Sommer  Frates v. Yolo County, 477 U.S. 340, 351 (1986). Drawing on these principles, the Rhode Island Supreme Court held that petitioner had not taken the necessary steps to ripen his takings claim.~    ~    ~      18~      The central question in resolving the ripeness issue, under Williamson County and other relevant decisions, is whether petitioner obtained a final decision from the Council determining the permitted use for the land. As we have noted, SGI's early applications to fill had been granted at one point, though that assent was later revoked. Petitioner then submitted two proposals: the 1983 proposal to fill the entire parcel, and the 1985 proposal to fill 11 of the property's 18 wetland acres for construction of the beach club. The court reasoned that, notwithstanding the Council's denials of the applications, doubt remained as to the extent of development the Council would allow on petitioner's parcel. We cannot agree.~    ~    ~      19~      The court based its holding in part upon petitioner's failure to explore \"any other use for the property that would involve filling substantially less wetlands.\" 746 A. 2d, at 714. It relied upon this Court's observations that the final decision requirement is not satisfied when a developer submits, and a land use authority denies, a grandiose development proposal, leaving open the possibility that lesser uses of the property might be permitted. See MacDonald, supra, at 353, n. 9. The suggestion is that while the Council rejected petitioner's effort to fill all of the wetlands, and then rejected his proposal to fill 11 of the wetland acres, perhaps an application to fill (for instance) 5 acres would have been approved. Thus, the reasoning goes, we cannot know for sure the extent of permitted development on petitioner's wetlands.~    ~    ~      20~      This is belied by the unequivocal nature of the wetland regulations at issue and by the Council's application of the regulations to the subject property. Winnapaug Pond is classified under the CRMP as a Type 2 body of water. See CRMP 200.2. A landowner, as a general rule, is prohibited from filling or building residential structures on wetlands adjacent to Type 2 waters, see id., Table 1, p. 22, and 210.3(C)(4), but may seek a special exception from the Council to engage in a prohibited use, see id., 130. The Council is permitted to allow the exception, however, only where a \"compelling public purpose\" is served. Id., 130A(2). The proposal to fill the entire property was not accepted under Council regulations and did not qualify for the special exception. The Council determined the use proposed in the second application (the beach club) did not satisfy the \"compelling public purpose\" standard. There is no indication the Council would have accepted the application had petitioner's proposed beach club occupied a smaller surface area. To the contrary, it ruled that the proposed activity was not a \"compelling public purpose.\" App. 27; cf. id., at 17 (1983 application to fill wetlands proposed an \"activity\" conflicting with the CRMP).~    ~    ~      21~      Williamson County's final decision requirement \"responds to the high degree of discretion characteristically possessed by land-use boards in softening the strictures of the general regulations they administer.\" Suitum v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 520 U.S. 725, 738 (1997). While a landowner must give a land-use authority an opportunity to exercise its discretion, once it becomes clear that the agency lacks the discretion to permit any development, or the permissible uses of the property are known to a reasonable degree of certainty, a takings claim is likely to have ripened. The case is quite unlike those upon which respondents place principal reliance, which arose when an owner challenged a land-use authority's denial of a substantial project, leaving doubt whether a more modest submission or an application for a variance would be accepted. See MacDonald, supra, at 342 (denial of 159-home residential subdivision); Williamson County, 473 U.S., at 182 (476-unit subdivision); cf. Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U.S. 255 (1980) (case not ripe because no plan to develop was submitted).~    ~    ~      22~      These cases stand for the important principle that a landowner may not establish a taking before a land-use authority has the opportunity, using its own reasonable procedures, to decide and explain the reach of a challenged regulation. Under our ripeness rules a takings claim based on a law or regulation which is alleged to go too far in burdening property depends upon the landowner's first having followed reasonable and necessary steps to allow regulatory agencies to exercise their full discretion in considering development plans for the property, including the opportunity to grant any variances or waivers allowed by law. As a general rule, until these ordinary processes have been followed the extent of the restriction on property is not known and a regulatory taking has not yet been established. See Suitum, supra, at 736, and n. 10 (noting difficulty of demonstrating that \"mere enactment\" of regulations restricting land use effects a taking). Government authorities, of course, may not burden property by imposition of repetitive or unfair land-use procedures in order to avoid a final decision. Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 698 (1999).~    ~    ~      23~      With respect to the wetlands on petitioner's property, the Council's decisions make plain that the agency interpreted its regulations to bar petitioner from engaging in any filling or development activity on the wetlands, a fact reinforced by the Attorney General's forthright responses to our questioning during oral argument in this case. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26, 31. The rulings of the Council interpreting the regulations at issue, and the briefs, arguments, and candid statements by counsel for both sides, leave no doubt on this point: On the wetlands there can be no fill for any ordinary land use. There can be no fill for its own sake; no fill for a beach club, either rustic or upscale; no fill for a subdivision; no fill for any likely or foreseeable use. And with no fill there can be no structures and no development on the wetlands. Further permit applications were not necessary to establish this point.~    ~    ~      24~      As noted above, however, not all of petitioner's parcel constitutes protected wetlands. The trial court accepted uncontested testimony that an upland site located at the eastern end of the property would have an estimated value of $200,000 if developed. App. to Pet. for Cert. B-5. While Council approval is required to develop upland property which lies within 200 feet of protected waters, see CRMP 100.1(A), the strict \"compelling public purpose\" test does not govern proposed land uses on property in this classification, see id., 110, Table 1A, 120. Council officials testified at trial, moreover, that they would have allowed petitioner to build a residence on the upland parcel. App. to Pet. for Cert. B-5. The State Supreme Court found petitioner's claim unripe for the further reason that he \"has not sought permission for any ... use of the property that would involve ... development only of the upland portion of the parcel.\" 746 A. 2d, at 714.~    ~    ~      25~      In assessing the significance of petitioner's failure to submit applications to develop the upland area it is important to bear in mind the purpose that the final decision requirement serves. Our ripeness jurisprudence imposes obligations on landowners because \"[a] court cannot determine whether a regulation goes 'too far' unless it knows how far the regulation goes.\" MacDonald, 477 U.S., at 348. Ripeness doctrine does not require a landowner to submit applications for their own sake. Petitioner is required to explore development opportunities on his upland parcel only if there is uncertainty as to the land's permitted use.~    ~    ~      26~      The State asserts the value of the uplands is in doubt. It relies in part on a comment in the opinion of the Rhode Island Supreme Court that \"it would be possible to build at least one single-family home on the upland portion of the parcel.\" 746 A. 2d, at 714. It argues that the qualification \"at least\" indicates that additional development beyond the single dwelling was possible. The attempt to interject ambiguity as to the value or use of the uplands, however, comes too late in the day for purposes of litigation before this Court. It was stated in the petition for certiorari that the uplands on petitioner's property had an estimated worth of $200,000. See Pet. for Cert. 21. The figure not only was uncontested but also was cited as fact in the State's brief in opposition. See Brief in Opposition 4, 19. In this circumstance ripeness cannot be contested by saying that the value of the nonwetland parcels is unknown. See Lucas, 505 U.S., at 1020, and n. 9.~    ~    ~      27~      The State's prior willingness to accept the $200,000 figure, furthermore, is well founded. The only reference to upland property in the trial court's opinion is to a single parcel worth an estimated $200,000. See App. to Pet. for Cert B-5. There was, it must be acknowledged, testimony at trial suggesting the existence of an additional upland parcel elsewhere on the property. See Tr. 190-191, 199-120 (testimony of Dr. Grover Fugate, Council Executive Director); see also id. at 610 (testimony of Mr. Steven Clarke). The testimony indicated, however, that the potential, second upland parcel was on an \"island\" which required construction of a road across wetlands, id., at 610, 623-624 (testimony of Mr. Clarke)-and, as discussed above, the filling of wetlands for such a purpose would not justify a special exception under Council regulations. See supra, at 10-11; see also Brief for Respondents 10 (\"Residential construction is not the basis of such a 'special exception' \"). Perhaps for this reason, the State did not maintain in the trial court that additional uplands could have been developed. To the contrary, its post-trial memorandum identified only the single parcel that petitioner concedes retains a development value of $200,000. See State's Post-Trial Memorandum in No. 88-0297 (Super. Ct. R. I.), 25, 81. The trial court accepted the figure. So there is no genuine ambiguity in the record as to the extent of permitted development on petitioner's property, either on the wetlands or the uplands.~    ~    ~      28~      Nonetheless, there is some suggestion that the use permitted on the uplands is not known, because the State accepted the $200,000 value for the upland parcel on the premise that only a Lucas claim was raised in the pleadings in the state trial court. See Brief of Respondents 29-30. Since a Penn Central argument was not pressed at trial, it is argued, the State had no reason to assert with vigor that more than a single-family residence might be placed on the uplands. We disagree; the State was aware of the applicability of Penn Central. The issue whether the Council's decisions amounted to a taking under Penn Central was discussed in the trial court, App. to Pet. for Cert. B-7, the State Supreme Court, 746 A. 2d, at 717, and the State's own post-trial submissions, see State's Post-Trial Supplemental Memorandum 7-10. The state court opinions cannot be read as indicating that a Penn Central claim was not properly presented from the outset of this litigation.~    ~    ~      29~      A final ripeness issue remains. In concluding that Williamson County's final decision requirement was not satisfied the State Supreme Court placed emphasis on petitioner's failure to \"appl[y] for permission to develop [the] seventy-four-lot subdivision\" that was the basis for the damages sought in his inverse condemnation suit. 746 A. 2d, at 714. The court did not explain why it thought this fact significant, but respondents and amici defend the ruling. The Council's practice, they assert, is to consider a proposal only if the applicant has satisfied all other regulatory preconditions for the use envisioned in the application. The subdivision proposal that was the basis for petitioner's takings claim, they add, could not have proceeded before the Council without, at minimum, zoning approval from the town of Westerly and a permit from the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management allowing the installation of individual sewage disposal systems on the property. Petitioner is accused of employing a hide the ball strategy of submitting applications for more modest uses to the Council, only to assert later a takings action predicated on the purported inability to build a much larger project. Brief for the National Wildlife Federation et al. as Amici Curiae 9.~    ~    ~      30~      It is difficult to see how this concern is relevant to the inquiry at issue here. Petitioner was informed by the Council that he could not fill the wetlands; it follows of necessity that he could not fill and then build 74 single-family dwellings upon it. Petitioner's submission of this proposal would not have clarified the extent of development permitted by the wetlands regulations, which is the inquiry required under our ripeness decisions. The State's concern may be that landowners could demand damages for a taking based on a project that could not have been constructed under other, valid zoning restrictions quite apart from the regulation being challenged. This, of course, is a valid concern in inverse condemnation cases alleging injury from wrongful refusal to permit development. The instant case does not require us to pass upon the authority of a state to insist in such cases that landowners follow normal planning procedures or to enact rules to control damage awards based on hypothetical uses that should have been reviewed in the normal course, and we do not intend to cast doubt upon such rules here. The mere allegation of entitlement to the value of an intensive use will not avail the landowner if the project would not have been allowed under other existing, legitimate land use limitations. When a taking has occurred, under accepted condemnation principles the owner's damages will be based upon the property's fair market value, see, e.g., Olson v. United States, 292 U.S. 246, 255 (1934); 4 J. Sackman, Nichols on Eminent Domain 12.01 (rev. 3d ed. 2000)-an inquiry which will turn, in part, on restrictions on use imposed by legitimate zoning or other regulatory limitations, see id., at 12C.03[1].~    ~    ~      31~      The state court, however, did not rely upon state law ripeness or exhaustion principles in holding that petitioner's takings claim was barred by virtue of his failure to apply for a 74-lot subdivision; it relied on Williamson County. As we have explained, Williamson County and our other ripeness decisions do not impose further obligations on petitioner, for the limitations the wetland regulations imposed were clear from the Council's denial of his applications, and there is no indication that any use involving any substantial structures or improvements would have been allowed. Where the state agency charged with enforcing a challenged land use regulation entertains an application from an owner and its denial of the application makes clear the extent of development permitted, and neither the agency nor a reviewing state court has cited non-compliance with reasonable state law exhaustion or pre-permit processes, see Felder v. Casey, 487 U.S. 131, 150-151 (1988), federal ripeness rules do not require the submission of further and futile applications with other agencies.~    ~    B~    ~      32~      We turn to the second asserted basis for declining to address petitioner's takings claim on the merits. When the Council promulgated its wetlands regulations, the disputed parcel was owned not by petitioner but by the corporation of which he was sole shareholder. When title was transferred to petitioner by operation of law, the wetlands regulations were in force. The state court held the postregulation acquisition of title was fatal to the claim for deprivation of all economic use, 746 A. 2d, at 716, and to the Penn Central claim, id., at 717. While the first holding was couched in terms of background principles of state property law, see Lucas, 505 U.S., at 1015, and the second in terms of petitioner's reasonable investment-backed expectations, see Penn Central, 438 U.S., at 124, the two holdings together amount to a single, sweeping, rule: A purchaser or a successive title holder like petitioner is deemed to have notice of an earlier-enacted restriction and is barred from claiming that it effects a taking.~    ~    ~      33~      The theory underlying the argument that post-enactment purchasers cannot challenge a regulation under the Takings Clause seems to run on these lines: Property rights are created by the State. See, e.g., Phillips v. Washington Legal Foundation, 524 U.S. 156, 163 (1998). So, the argument goes, by prospective legislation the State can shape and define property rights and reasonable investment-backed expectations, and subsequent owners cannot claim any injury from lost value. After all, they purchased or took title with notice of the limitation.~    ~    ~      34~      The State may not put so potent a Hobbesian stick into the Lockean bundle. The right to improve property, of course, is subject to the reasonable exercise of state authority, including the enforcement of valid zoning and land-use restrictions. See Pennsylvania Coal Co., 260 U.S., at 413 (\"Government hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law\"). The Takings Clause, however, in certain circumstances allows a landowner to assert that a particular exercise of the State's regulatory power is so unreasonable or onerous as to compel compensation. Just as a prospective enactment, such as a new zoning ordinance, can limit the value of land without effecting a taking because it can be understood as reasonable by all concerned, other enactments are unreasonable and do not become less so through passage of time or title. Were we to accept the State's rule, the postenactment transfer of title would absolve the State of its obligation to defend any action restricting land use, no matter how extreme or unreasonable. A State would be allowed, in effect, to put an expiration date on the Takings Clause. This ought not to be the rule. Future generations, too, have a right to challenge unreasonable limitations on the use and value of land.~    ~    ~      35~      Nor does the justification of notice take into account the effect on owners at the time of enactment, who are prejudiced as well. Should an owner attempt to challenge a new regulation, but not survive the process of ripening his or her claim (which, as this case demonstrates, will often take years), under the proposed rule the right to compensation may not by asserted by an heir or successor, and so may not be asserted at all. The State's rule would work a critical alteration to the nature of property, as the newly regulated landowner is stripped of the ability to transfer the interest which was possessed prior to the regulation. The State may not by this means secure a windfall for itself. See Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U.S. 155, 164 (1980) (\"[A] State, by ipse dixit, may not transform private property into public property without compensation\"); cf. Ellickson, Property in Land, 102 Yale L. J. 1315, 1368-1369 (1993) (right to transfer interest in land is a defining characteristic of the fee simple estate). The proposed rule is, furthermore, capricious in effect. The young owner contrasted with the older owner, the owner with the resources to hold contrasted with the owner with the need to sell, would be in different positions. The Takings Clause is not so quixotic. A blanket rule that purchasers with notice have no compensation right when a claim becomes ripe is too blunt an instrument to accord with the duty to compensate for what is taken.~    ~    ~      36~      Direct condemnation, by invocation of the State's power of eminent domain, presents different considerations than cases alleging a taking based on a burdensome regulation. In a direct condemnation action, or when a State has physically invaded the property without filing suit, the fact and extent of the taking are known. In such an instance, it is a general rule of the law of eminent domain that any award goes to the owner at the time of the taking, and that the right to compensation is not passed to a subsequent purchaser. See Danforth v. United States, 308 U.S. 271, 284 (1939); 2 Sackman, Eminent Domain, at 5.01[5][d][i] (\"It is well settled that when there is a taking of property by eminent domain in compliance with the law, it is the owner of the property at the time of the taking who is entitled to compensation\"). A challenge to the application of a land-use regulation, by contrast, does not mature until ripeness requirements have been satisfied, under principles we have discussed; until this point an inverse condemnation claim alleging a regulatory taking cannot be maintained. It would be illogical, and unfair, to bar a regulatory takings claim because of the post-enactment transfer of ownership where the steps necessary to make the claim ripe were not taken, or could not have been taken, by a previous owner.~    ~    ~      37~      There is controlling precedent for our conclusion. Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, 483 U.S. 825 (1987), presented the question whether it was consistent with the Takings Clause for a state regulatory agency to require oceanfront landowners to provide lateral beach access to the public as the condition for a development permit. The principal dissenting opinion observed it was a policy of the California Coastal Commission to require the condition, and that the Nollans, who purchased their home after the policy went into effect, were \"on notice that new developments would be approved only if provisions were made for lateral beach access.\" Id., at 860 (Brennan, J., dissenting). A majority of the Court rejected the proposition. \"So long as the Commission could not have deprived the prior owners of the easement without compensating them,\" the Court reasoned, \"the prior owners must be understood to have transferred their full property rights in conveying the lot.\" Id., at 834, n. 2.~    ~    ~      38~      It is argued that Nollan's holding was limited by the later decision in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003 (1992). In Lucas the Court observed that a landowner's ability to recover for a government deprivation of all economically beneficial use of property is not absolute but instead is confined by limitations on the use of land which \"inhere in the title itself.\" Id., at 1029. This is so, the Court reasoned, because the landowner is constrained by those \"restrictions that background principles of the State's law of property and nuisance already place upon land ownership.\" Id., at 1029. It is asserted here that Lucas stands for the proposition that any new regulation, once enacted, becomes a background principle of property law which cannot be challenged by those who acquire title after the enactment.~    ~    ~      39~      We have no occasion to consider the precise circumstances when a legislative enactment can be deemed a background principle of state law or whether those circumstances are present here. It suffices to say that a regulation that otherwise would be unconstitutional absent compensation is not transformed into a background principle of the State's law by mere virtue of the passage of title. This relative standard would be incompatible with our description of the concept in Lucas, which is explained in terms of those common, shared understandings of permissible limitations derived from a State's legal tradition, see Lucas, supra, at 1029-1030. A regulation or common-law rule cannot be a background principle for some owners but not for others. The determination whether an existing, general law can limit all economic use of property must turn on objective factors, such as the nature of the land use proscribed. See Lucas, supra, at 1030 (\"The 'total taking' inquiry we require today will ordinarily entail ... analysis of, among other things, the degree of harm to public lands and resources, or adjacent private property, posed by the claimant's proposed activities\"). A law does not become a background principle for subsequent owners by enactment itself. Lucas did not overrule our holding in Nollan, which, as we have noted, is based on essential Takings Clause principles.~    ~    ~      40~      For reasons we discuss next, the state court will not find it necessary to explore these matters on remand in connection with the claim that all economic use was deprived; it must address, however, the merits of petitioner's claim under Penn Central. That claim is not barred by the mere fact that title was acquired after the effective date of the state-imposed restriction.~    ~    III~    ~      41~      As the case is ripe, and as the date of transfer of title does not bar petitioner's takings claim, we have before us the alternative ground relied upon by the Rhode Island Supreme Court in ruling upon the merits of the takings claims. It held that all economically beneficial use was not deprived because the uplands portion of the property can still be improved. On this point, we agree with the court's decision. Petitioner accepts the Council's contention and the state trial court's finding that his parcel retains $200,000 in development value under the State's wetlands regulations. He asserts, nonetheless, that he has suffered a total taking and contends the Council cannot sidestep the holding in Lucas \"by the simple expedient of leaving a landowner a few crumbs of value.\" Brief for Petitioner 37.~    ~    ~      42~      Assuming a taking is otherwise established, a State may not evade the duty to compensate on the premise that the landowner is left with a token interest. This is not the situation of the landowner in this case, however. A regulation permitting a landowner to build a substantial residence on an 18-acre parcel does not leave the property \"economically idle.\" Lucas, supra, at 1019.~    ~    ~      43~      In his brief submitted to us petitioner attempts to revive this part of his claim by reframing it. He argues, for the first time, that the upland parcel is distinct from the wetlands portions, so he should be permitted to assert a deprivation limited to the latter. This contention asks us to examine the difficult, persisting question of what is the proper denominator in the takings fraction. See Michelman, Property, Utility, and Fairness: Comments on the Ethical Foundations of \"Just Compensation Law,\" 80 Harv. L. Rev. 1165, 1192 (1967). Some of our cases indicate that the extent of deprivation effected by a regulatory action is measured against the value of the parcel as a whole, see, e.g., Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470, 497 (1987); but we have at times expressed discomfort with the logic of this rule, see Lucas, supra, at 1016-1017, n. 7, a sentiment echoed by some commentators, see, e.g., Epstein, Takings: Descent and Resurrection, 1987 Sup. Ct. Rev. 1, 16-17 (1987); Fee, Unearthing the Denominator in Regulatory Takings Claims, 61 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1535 (1994). Whatever the merits of these criticisms, we will not explore the point here. Petitioner did not press the argument in the state courts, and the issue was not presented in the petition for certiorari. The case comes to us on the premise that petitioner's entire parcel serves as the basis for his takings claim, and, so framed, the total deprivation argument fails.~    ~    ~      44~      * * *~    ~    ~      45~      For the reasons we have discussed, the State Supreme Court erred in finding petitioner's claims were unripe and in ruling that acquisition of title after the effective date of the regulations barred the takings claims. The court did not err in finding that petitioner failed to establish a deprivation of all economic value, for it is undisputed that the parcel retains significant worth for construction of a residence. The claims under the Penn Central analysis were not examined, and for this purpose the case should be remanded.~    ~    ~      46~      The judgment of the Rhode Island Supreme Court is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      47~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      48~      O'Connor, J., and Scalia, J., filed concurring opinions.~    ~    ~      49~      Stevens, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.~    ~    ~      50~      Ginsburg, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Souter and Breyer, JJ., joined.~    ~    ~      51~      Breyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion.~    ~    ~      52~      Justice O'Connor, concurring.~    ~    ~      53~      I join the opinion of the Court but with my understanding of how the issues discussed in Part II-B of the opinion must be considered on remand.~    ~    ~      54~      Part II-B of the Court's opinion addresses the circumstance, present in this case, where a takings claimant has acquired title to the regulated property after the enactment of the regulation at issue. As the Court holds, the Rhode Island Supreme Court erred in effectively adopting the sweeping rule that the preacquisition enactment of the use restriction ipso facto defeats any takings claim based on that use restriction. Accordingly, the Court holds that petitioner's claim under Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104 (1978), \"is not barred by the mere fact that title was acquired after the effective date of the state-imposed restriction.\" Ante, at 21.~    ~    ~      55~      The more difficult question is what role the temporal relationship between regulatory enactment and title acquisition plays in a proper Penn Central analysis. Today's holding does not mean that the timing of the regulation's enactment relative to the acquisition of title is immaterial to the Penn Central analysis. Indeed, it would be just as much error to expunge this consideration from the takings inquiry as it would be to accord it exclusive significance. Our polestar instead remains the principles set forth in Penn Central itself and our other cases that govern partial regulatory takings. Under these cases, interference with investment-backed expectations is one of a number of factors that a court must examine. Further, the regulatory regime in place at the time the claimant acquires the property at issue helps to shape the reasonableness of those expectations.~    ~    ~      56~      The Fifth Amendment forbids the taking of private property for public use without just compensation. We have recognized that this constitutional guarantee is \" 'designed to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.' \" Penn Central, supra, at 123-124 (quoting Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S. 40, 49 (1960)). The concepts of \"fairness and justice\" that underlie the Takings Clause, of course, are less than fully determinate. Accordingly, we have eschewed \"any 'set formula' for determining when 'justice and fairness' require that economic injuries caused by public action be compensated by the government, rather than remain disproportionately concentrated on a few persons.\" Penn Central, supra, at 124 (quoting Goldblatt v. Hempstead, 369 U.S. 590, 594 (1962)). The outcome instead \"depends largely 'upon the particular circumstances [in that] case.' \" Penn Central, supra, at 124 (quoting United States v. Central Eureka Mining Co., 357 U.S. 155, 168 (1958)).~    ~    ~      57~      We have \"identified several factors that have particular significance\" in these \"essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries.\" Penn Central, 438 U.S., at 124. Two such factors are \"[t]he economic impact of the regulation on the claimant and, particularly, the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations.\" Ibid. Another is \"the character of the governmental action.\" Ibid. The purposes served, as well as the effects produced, by a particular regulation inform the takings analysis. Id., at 127 (\"[A] use restriction on real property may constitute a 'taking' if not reasonably necessary to the effectuation of a substantial public purpose, [citations omitted], or perhaps if it has an unduly harsh impact upon the owner's use of the property\"); see also Yee v. Escondido, 503 U.S. 519, 523 (1992) (Regulatory takings cases \"necessarily entai[l] complex factual assessments of the purposes and economic effects of government actions\"). Penn Central does not supply mathematically precise variables, but instead provides important guideposts that lead to the ultimate determination whether just compensation is required.~    ~    ~      58~      The Rhode Island Supreme Court concluded that, because the wetlands regulations predated petitioner's acquisition of the property at issue, petitioner lacked reasonable investment-backed expectations and hence lacked a viable takings claim. 746 A. 2d 707, 717 (2000). The court erred in elevating what it believed to be \"[petitioner's] lack of reasonable investment-backed expectations\" to \"dispositive\" status. Ibid. Investment-backed expectations, though important, are not talismanic under Penn Central. Evaluation of the degree of interference with investment-backed expectations instead is one factor that points toward the answer to the question whether the application of a particular regulation to particular property \"goes too far.\" Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 415 (1922).~    ~    ~      59~      Further, the state of regulatory affairs at the time of acquisition is not the only factor that may determine the extent of investment-backed expectations. For example, the nature and extent of permitted development under the regulatory regime vis--vis the development sought by the claimant may also shape legitimate expectations without vesting any kind of development right in the property owner. We also have never held that a takings claim is defeated simply on account of the lack of a personal financial investment by a postenactment acquirer of property, such as a donee, heir, or devisee. Cf. Hodel v. Irving, 481 U.S. 704, 714-718 (1987). Courts instead must attend to those circumstances which are probative of what fairness requires in a given case.~    ~    ~      60~      If investment-backed expectations are given exclusive significance in the Penn Central analysis and existing regulations dictate the reasonableness of those expectations in every instance, then the State wields far too much power to redefine property rights upon passage of title. On the other hand, if existing regulations do nothing to inform the analysis, then some property owners may reap windfalls and an important indicium of fairness is lost.* As I understand it, our decision today does not remove the regulatory backdrop against which an owner takes title to property from the purview of the Penn Central inquiry. It simply restores balance to that inquiry. Courts properly consider the effect of existing regulations under the rubric of investment-backed expectations in determining whether a compensable taking has occurred. As before, the salience of these facts cannot be reduced to any \"set formula.\" Penn Central, 438 U.S., at 124 (internal quotation marks omitted). The temptation to adopt what amount to per se rules in either direction must be resisted. The Takings Clause requires careful examination and weighing of all the relevant circumstances in this context. The court below therefore must consider on remand the array of relevant factors under Penn Central before deciding whether any compensation is due.~    ~    ~      ~        Notes:~      ~      ~        *~         Justice Scalia's inapt \"government-as-thief\" simile is symptomatic of the larger failing of his opinion, which is that he appears to conflate two questions. The first question is whether the enactment or application of a regulation constitutes a valid exercise of the police power. The second question is whether the State must compensate a property owner for a diminution in value effected by the State's exercise of its police power. We have held that \"[t]he 'public use' requirement [of the Takings Clause] is . . . coterminous with the scope of a sovereign's police powers.\" Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229, 240 (1984). The relative timing of regulatory enactment and title acquisition, of course, does not affect the analysis of whether a State has acted within the scope of these powers in the first place. That issue appears to be the one on which Justice Scalia focuses, but it is not the matter at hand. The relevant question instead is the second question described above. It is to this inquiry that \"investment-backed expectations\" and the state of regulatory affairs upon acquisition of title are relevant under Penn Central. Justice Scalia's approach therefore would seem to require a revision of the Penn Central analysis that this Court has not undertaken.~      ~    ~    ~      61~      Justice Scalia, concurring.~    ~    ~      62~      I write separately to make clear that my understanding of how the issues discussed in Part II-B of the Court's opinion must be considered on remand is not Justice O'Connor's.~    ~    ~      63~      The principle that underlies her separate concurrence is that it may in some (unspecified) circumstances be \"[un]fai[r],\" and produce unacceptable \"windfalls,\" to allow a subsequent purchaser to nullify an unconstitutional partial taking (though, inexplicably, not an unconstitutional total taking) by the government. Ante, at 4. The polar horrible, presumably, is the situation in which a sharp real estate developer, realizing (or indeed, simply gambling on) the unconstitutional excessiveness of a development restriction that a na ;ve landowner assumes to be valid, purchases property at what it would be worth subject to the restriction, and then develops it to its full value (or resells it at its full value) after getting the unconstitutional restriction invalidated.~    ~    ~      64~      This can, I suppose, be called a windfall-though it is not much different from the windfalls that occur every day at stock exchanges or antique auctions, where the knowledgeable (or the venturesome) profit at the expense of the ignorant (or the risk averse). There is something to be said (though in my view not much) for pursuing abstract \"fairness\" by requiring part or all of that windfall to be returned to the naive original owner, who presumably is the \"rightful\" owner of it. But there is nothing to be said for giving it instead to the government-which not only did not lose something it owned, but is both the cause of the miscarriage of \"fairness\" and the only one of the three parties involved in the miscarriage (government, naive original owner, and sharp real estate developer) which acted unlawfully-indeed unconstitutionally. Justice O'Connor would eliminate the windfall by giving the malefactor the benefit of its malefaction. It is rather like eliminating the windfall that accrued to a purchaser who bought property at a bargain rate from a thief clothed with the indicia of title, by making him turn over the \"unjust\" profit to the thief.*~    ~    ~      65~      In my view, the fact that a restriction existed at the time the purchaser took title (other than a restriction forming part of the \"background principles of the State's law of property and nuisance,\" Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 1029 (1992)) should have no bearing upon the determination of whether the restriction is so substantial as to constitute a taking. The \"investment-backed expectations\" that the law will take into account do not include the assumed validity of a restriction that in fact deprives property of so much of its value as to be unconstitutional. Which is to say that a Penn Central taking, see Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104 (1978), no less than a total taking, is not absolved by the transfer of title.~    ~    ~      ~        Notes:~      ~      ~        *~         Contrary to Justice O'Connor's assertion, post, at 4, n., my contention of governmental wrongdoing does not assume that the government exceeded its police powers by ignoring the \"public use\" requirement of the Takings Clause, see Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229, 240 (1984). It is wrong for the government to take property, even for public use, without tendering just compensation.~      ~    ~    ~      66~      Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Souter and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.~    ~    ~      67~      A regulatory takings claim is not ripe for adjudication, this Court has held, until the agency administering the regulations at issue, proceeding in good faith, \"has arrived at a final, definitive position regarding how it will apply [those regulations] to the particular land in question.\" Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U.S. 172, 191 (1985). Absent such a final decision, a court cannot \"kno[w] the nature and extent of permitted development\" under the regulations, and therefore cannot say \"how far the regulation[s] g[o],\" as regulatory takings law requires. MacDonald, Sommer  Frates v. Yolo County, 477 U.S. 340, 348, 351 (1986). Therefore, even when a landowner seeks and is denied permission to develop property, if the denial does not demonstrate the effective impact of the regulations on the land, the denial does not represent the \"final decision\" requisite to generate a ripe dispute. Williamson County, 473 U.S., at 190.~    ~    ~      68~      MacDonald illustrates how a highly ambitious application may not ripen a takings claim. The landowner in that case proposed a 159-home subdivision. 477 U.S., at 342. When that large proposal was denied, the owner complained that the State had appropriated \"all beneficial use of its property.\" Id., at 352, n. 8; see also id., at 344. This Court concluded, however, that the landowner's claim was not ripe, for the denial of the massive development left \"open the possibility that some development [would] be permitted.\" Id., at 352. \"Rejection of exceedingly grandiose development plans,\" the Court observed, \"does not logically imply that less ambitious plans will receive similarly unfavorable reviews.\" Id., at 353, n. 9.~    ~    ~      69~      As presented to the Rhode Island Supreme Court, Anthony Palazzolo's case was a close analogue to MacDonald. Palazzolo's land has two components. Approximately 18 acres are wetlands that sustain a rich but delicate ecosystem. See 746 A. 2d 707, 710, and n. 1 (R. I. 2000). Additional acres are less environmentally sensitive \"uplands.\" (The number of upland acres remains in doubt, see ibid., because Palazzolo has never submitted \"an accurate or detailed survey\" of his property, see Tr. 190 (June 18-19, 1997).) Rhode Island's administrative agency with ultimate permitting authority over the wetlands, the Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC), bars residential development of the wetlands, but not the uplands.~    ~    ~      70~      Although Palazzolo submitted several applications to develop his property, those applications uniformly sought permission to fill most or all of the wetlands portion of the property. None aimed to develop only the uplands.1 Upon denial of the last of Palazzolo's applications, Palazzolo filed suit claiming that Rhode Island had taken his property by refusing \"to allow any development.\" App. 45 (Complaint 17).~    ~    ~      71~      As the Rhode Island Supreme Court saw the case, Palazzolo's claim was not ripe for several reasons, among them, that Palazzolo had not sought permission for \"development only of the upland portion of the parcel.\" 746 A. 2d, at 714. The Rhode Island court emphasized the \"undisputed evidence in the record that it would be possible to build at least one single-family home on the existing upland area, with no need for additional fill.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      72~      Today, the Court rejects the Rhode Island court's determination that the case is unripe, finding no \"uncertainty as to the [uplands'] permitted use.\" Ante, at 12. The Court's conclusion is, in my view, both inaccurate and inequitable. It is inaccurate because the record is ambiguous. And it is inequitable because, given the claim asserted by Palazzolo in the Rhode Island courts, the State had no cause to pursue further inquiry into potential upland development. But Palazzolo presses other claims here, and at his behest, the Court not only entertains them, but also turns the State's legitimate defense against the claim Palazzolo originally stated into a weapon against the State. I would reject Palazzolo's bait-and-switch ploy and affirm the judgment of the Rhode Island Supreme Court.~    ~    ~      73~      * * *~    ~    ~      74~      Where physical occupation of land is not at issue, the Court's cases identify two basic forms of regulatory taking. Ante, at 7-8. In Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003 (1992), the Court held that, subject to \"certain qualifications,\" ante, at 7, 20, denial of \"all economically beneficial or productive use of land\" constitutes a taking. 505 U.S., at 1015 (emphasis added). However, if a regulation does not leave the property \"economically idle,\" id., at 1019, to establish the alleged taking the landowner may pursue the multifactor inquiry set out in Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 123-125 (1978).~    ~    ~      75~      Like the landowner in MacDonald, Palazzolo sought federal constitutional relief only under a straightforward application of Lucas. See ante, at 6; App. 45 (Complaint 17) (\"As a direct and proximate result of the Defendants' refusal to allow any development of the property, there has been a taking\" (emphasis added)); Plaintiff's Post Trial Memorandum in No. 88-0297 (Super. Ct., R. I.), p. 6 (\"[T]his Court need not look beyond the Lucas case as its very lucid and precise standards will determine whether a taking has occurred.\"); id., at 9-10 (\"[T]here is NO USE for the property whatsoever... . Not one scintilla of evidence was proffered by the State to prove, intimate or even suggest a theoretical possibility of any use for this property-never mind a beneficial use. Not once did the State claim that there is, in fact, some use available for the Palazzolo parcel.\"); Brief of Appellant in No. 98-0333, pp. 5, 7, 9-10 (hereinafter Brief of Appellant) (restating, verbatim, assertions of Post Trial Memorandum quoted above).~    ~    ~      76~      Responding to Palazzolo's Lucas claim, the State urged as a sufficient defense this now uncontested point: CRMC \"would [have been] happy to have [Palazzolo] situate a home\" on the uplands, \"thus allowing [him] to realize 200,000 dollars.\" State's Post-Trial Memorandum in No. 88-0297 (Super. Ct., R. I.), p. 81; see also Brief of Appellees in No. 98-0333A, p. 25 (hereinafter Brief of Appellees) (Palazzolo \"never even applied for the realistic alternative of using the entire parcel as a single unitary home-site\"). The State did present some evidence at trial that more than one lot could be developed. See infra, at 8-9. And, in a supplemental post-trial memorandum addressing a then-new Rhode Island Supreme Court decision, the State briefly urged that Palazzolo's claims would fail even under Penn Central. See ante, at 14. The evidence of additional uses and the post-trial argument directed to Penn Central, however, were underdeveloped and unnecessary, for Palazzolo himself, in his pleadings and at trial, pressed only a Lucas-based claim that he had been denied all economically viable use of his property. Once the State demonstrated that an \"economically beneficial\" development was genuinely plausible, Lucas, 505 U.S., at 1015, the State had established the analogy to MacDonald: The record now showed \"valuable use might still be made of the land.\" 477 U.S., at 352, n. 8; see Brief of Appellees 24-25 (relying on MacDonald). The prospect of real development shown by the State warranted a ripeness dismissal of Palazzolo's complaint.~    ~    ~      77~      Addressing the State's Lucas defense in Lucas terms, Palazzolo insisted that his land had \"no use ... as a result of CRMC's application of its regulations.\" Brief of Appellant 11. The Rhode Island Supreme Court rejected Palazzolo's argument, identifying in the record evidence that Palazzolo could build at least one home on the uplands. 746 A. 2d, at 714. The court therefore concluded that Palazzolo's failure to seek permission for \"development only of the upland portion of the parcel\" meant that Palazzolo could not \"maintain a claim that the CRMC ha[d] deprived him of all beneficial use of the property.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      78~      It is true that the Rhode Island courts, in the course of ruling for the State, briefly touched base with Penn Central. Cf. ante, at 14. The critical point, however, underplayed by the Court, is that Palazzolo never raised or argued the Penn Central issue in the state system: not in his complaint; not in his trial court submissions; not-even after the trial court touched on the Penn Central issue-in his briefing on appeal. The state high court decision, raising and quickly disposing of the matter, unquestionably permits us to consider the Penn Central issue. See Raley v. Ohio, 360 U.S. 423, 436-437 (1959). But the ruling below does not change the reality essential here: Palazzolo litigated his takings claim, and it was incumbent on the State to defend against that claim, only under Lucas.~    ~    ~      79~      If Palazzolo's arguments in this Court had tracked his arguments in the state courts, his petition for certiorari would have argued simply that the Rhode Island courts got it wrong in failing to see that his land had \"no use\" at all because of CRMC's rules. Brief of Appellant 11. This Court likely would not have granted certiorari to review the application of MacDonald and Lucas to the facts of Palazzolo's case. However, aided by new counsel, Palazzolo sought-and in the exercise of this Court's discretion obtained-review of two contentions he did not advance below. The first assertion is that the state regulations take the property under Penn Central. See Pet. for Cert. 20; Brief for Petitioner 47-50. The second argument is that the regulations amount to a taking under an expanded rendition of Lucas covering cases in which a landowner is left with property retaining only a \"few crumbs of value.\" Ante, at 21 (quoting Brief for Petitioner 37); Pet. for Cert. 20-22. Again, it bears repetition, Palazzolo never claimed in the courts below that, if the State were correct that his land could be used for a residence, a taking nonetheless occurred.2~    ~    ~      80~      In support of his new claims, Palazzolo has conceded the very point on which the State properly relied to resist the simple Lucas claim presented below: that Palazzolo can obtain approval for one house of substantial economic value. Palazzolo does not merely accept the argument that the State advanced below. He now contends that the evidence proffered by the State in the Rhode Island courts supports the claims he presents here, by demonstrating that only one house would be approved. See Brief for Petitioner 13 (\"[T]he uncontradicted evidence was that CRMC ... would not deny [Palazzolo] permission to build one single-family home on the small upland portion of his property.\" (emphasis deleted)); Pet. for Cert. 15 (the extent of development permitted on the land is \"perfectly clear: one single-family home and nothing more\").~    ~    ~      81~      As a logical matter, Palazzolo's argument does not stand up. The State's submissions in the Rhode Island courts hardly establish that Palazzolo could obtain approval for only one house of value. By showing that Palazzolo could have obtained approval for a $200,000 house (rather than, say, two houses worth $400,000), the State's submissions established only a floor, not a ceiling, on the value of permissible development. For a floor value was all the State needed to defeat Palazzolo's simple Lucas claim.~    ~    ~      82~      Furthermore, Palazzolo's argument is unfair: The argument transforms the State's legitimate defense to the only claim Palazzolo stated below into offensive support for other claims he states for the first time here. Casting away fairness (and fairness to a State, no less), the Court indulges Palazzolo's bait-and-switch maneuver. The Court concludes that \"there is no genuine ambiguity in the record as to the extent of permitted development on ... the uplands.\" Ante, at 13-14. Two theories are offered to support this conclusion.~    ~    ~      83~      First, the Court asserts, it is \"too late in the day\" for the State to contend the uplands give the property more than $200,000 in value; Palazzolo \"stated\" in his petition for certiorari that the property has \"an estimated worth of $200,000,\" and the State cited that contention \"as fact\" in its Brief in Opposition. Ante, as 13. But in the cited pages of its Brief in Opposition, the State simply said it \"would\" approve a \"single home\" worth $200,000. Brief in Opposition 4, 19. That statement does not foreclose the possibility that the State would also approve another home, adding further value to the property.~    ~    ~      84~      To be sure, the Brief in Opposition did overlook Palazzolo's change in his theory of the case, a change that, had it been asserted earlier, could have rendered insufficient the evidence the State intelligently emphasized below. But the State's failure to appreciate that Palazzolo had moved the pea to a different shell hardly merits the Court's waiver finding. The only precedent cited for the waiver, a footnote in Lucas, is not remotely on point. Ante, at 13. The landowner in Lucas had invoked a \"finding\" of fact by the state court, and this Court deemed the State's challenge to that finding waived because the challenge was not timely raised. Lucas, 505 U.S., at 1020-1022, n. 9. There is nothing extraordinary about this Court's deciding a case on the findings made by a state court. Here, however, the \"fact\" this Court has stopped the State from contesting-that the property has value of only $200,000-was never found by any court. That valuation was simply asserted, inaccurately, see infra, at 9, in Palazzolo's petition for certiorari. This Court's waiver ruling thus amounts to an unsavory invitation to unscrupulous litigants: Change your theory and misrepresent the record in your petition for certiorari; if the respondent fails to note your machinations, you have created a different record on which this Court will review the case.~    ~    ~      85~      The Court bolsters its waiver finding by asserting that the $200,000 figure is \"well founded\" in the record. Ante, at 13. But, as earlier observed, an absence of multiple valuation possibilities in the record cannot be held against the State, for proof of more than the $200,000 development was unnecessary to defend against the Lucas claim singularly pleaded below. And in any event, the record does not warrant the Court's conclusion.~    ~    ~      86~      The Court acknowledges \"testimony at trial suggesting the existence of an additional upland parcel elsewhere on the property\" on which a second house might be built. Ante, at 13. The Court discounts that prospect, however, on the ground that development of the additional parcel would require a new road forbidden under CRMC's regulations. Ibid. Yet the one witness on whose testimony the Court relies, Steven M. Clarke, himself concluded that it would be \"realistic to apply for\" development at more than one location. Tr. 612 (June 25-26, 1997). Clarke added that a state official, Russell Chateauneuf, \"gave [Clarke] supporting information saying that [multiple applications] made sense.\" Ibid. The conclusions of Clarke and Chateauneuf are confirmed by the testimony of CRMC's executive director, Grover Fugate, who agreed with Palazzolo's counsel during cross-examination that Palazzolo might be able to build \"on two, perhaps three, perhaps four of the lots.\" Id., at 211 (June 20-23, 1997); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 27 (\"[T]here is ... uncertainty as to what additional upland there is and how many other houses can be built.\").  The ambiguities in the record thus are substantial. They persist in part because their resolution was not required to address the claim Palazzolo presented below, and in part because Palazzolo failed ever to submit an accurate survey of his property. Under the circumstances, I would not step into the role of supreme topographical factfinder to resolve ambiguities in Palazzolo's favor. Instead, I would look to, and rely on, the opinion of the state court whose decision we now review. That opinion states: \"There was undisputed evidence in the record that it would be possible to build at least one single-family home on the existing upland area.\" 746 A. 2d, at 714 (emphasis added). This Court cites nothing to warrant amendment of that finding.3~    ~    ~      87~      * * *~    ~    ~      88~      In sum, as I see this case, we still do not know \"the nature and extent of permitted development\" under the regulation in question, MacDonald, 477 U.S., at 351. I would therefore affirm the Rhode Island Supreme Court's judgment.~    ~    ~      ~        Notes:~      ~      ~        1~         Moreover, none proposed the 74-lot subdivision Palazzolo advances as the basis for the compensation he seeks. Palazzolo's first application sought to fill all 18 acres of wetlands for no stated purpose whatever. See App. 11 (Palazzolo's sworn 1983 answer to the question why he sought to fill uplands) (\"Because it's my right to do if I want to to look at it it is my business.\"). Palazzolo's second application proposed a most disagreeable \"beach club.\" See ante, at 5 (\"trash bins\" and \"port-a-johns\" sought); Tr. 650 (June 25-26, 1997) (testimony of engineer Steven M. Clarke) (to get to the club's water, i.e., Winnapaug Pond rather than the nearby Atlantic Ocean, \"you'd have to walk across the gravel fill, but then work your way through approximately 70, 75 feet of marsh land or conservation grasses\"). Neither of the CRMC applications supplied a clear map of the proposed development. See App. 7, 16 (1983 application); Tr. 190 (June 18-19, 1997) (1985 application). The Rhode Island Supreme Court ultimately concluded that the 74-lot development would have been barred by zoning requirements, apart from CRMC regulations, requirements Palazzolo never explored. See 746 A. 2d 707, 715, n. 7 (2000).~      ~      ~        2~         After this Court granted certiorari, in his briefing on the merits, Palazzolo presented still another takings theory. That theory, in tension with numerous holdings of this Court, see, e.g., Concrete Pipe  Products of Cal., Inc. v. Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern Cal., 508 U.S. 602, 643-644 (1993), was predicated on treatment of his wetlands as a property separate from the uplands. The Court properly declines to reach this claim. Ante, at 22.~      ~      ~        3~         If Palazzolo's claim were ripe and the merits properly presented, I would, at a minimum, agree with Justice O'Connor, ante, at 1-5 (concurring opinion), Justice Stevens, ante, at 6-7 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part), and Justice Breyer, ante, at 1-2 (dissenting opinion), that transfer of title can impair a takings claim.~      ~    ~    ~      89~      Justice Breyer, dissenting.~    ~    ~      90~      I agree with Justice Ginsburg that Palazzolo's takings claim is not ripe for adjudication, and I join her opinion in full. Ordinarily I would go no further. But because the Court holds the takings claim to be ripe and goes on to address some important issues of substantive takings law, I add that, given this Court's precedents, I would agree with Justice O'Connor that the simple fact that a piece of property has changed hands (for example, by inheritance) does not always and automatically bar a takings claim. Here, for example, without in any way suggesting that Palazzolo has any valid takings claim, I believe his postregulatory acquisition of the property (through automatic operation of law) by itself should not prove dispositive.~    ~    ~      91~      As Justice O'Connor explains, under Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104 (1978), much depends upon whether, or how, the timing and circumstances of a change of ownership affect whatever reasonable investment-backed expectations might otherwise exist. Ordinarily, such expectations will diminish in force and significance-rapidly and dramatically-as property continues to change hands over time. I believe that such factors can adequately be taken into account within the Penn Central framework.~    ~    ~      92~      Several amici have warned that to allow complete regulatory takings claims, see Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003 (1992), to survive changes in land ownership could allow property owners to manufacture such claims by strategically transferring property until only a nonusable portion remains. See, e.g., Brief for Daniel W. Bromley et al. as Amici Curiae 7-8. But I do not see how a constitutional provision concerned with \" 'fairness and justice,' \" Penn Central, supra, at 123-124 (quoting Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S. 40, 49 (1960)), could reward any such strategic behavior.~    ~    ~      93~      Justice Stevens, concurring in part and dissenting in part.~    ~    ~      94~      In an admirable effort to frame its inquiries in broadly significant terms, the majority offers six pages of commentary on the issue of whether an owner of property can challenge regulations adopted prior to her acquisition of that property without ever discussing the particular facts or legal claims at issue in this case. See ante, at 16-21. While I agree with some of what the Court has to say on this issue, an examination of the issue in the context of the facts of this case convinces me that the Court has over-simplified a complex calculus and conflated two separate questions. Therefore, while I join Part II-A of the opinion, I dissent from the judgment and, in particular, from Part II-B.~    ~    ~      95~      * Though States and local governments have broad power to adopt regulations limiting land usage, those powers are constrained by the Constitution and by other provisions of state law. In adopting land-use restrictions, local authorities must follow legally valid and constitutionally sufficient procedures and must adhere to whatever substantive requirements are imposed by the Constitution and supervening law. If a regulating body fails to adhere to its procedural or substantive obligations in developing land- use restrictions, anyone adversely impacted by the restrictions may challenge their validity in an injunctive action. If the application of such restriction to a property owner would cause her a \"direct and substantial injury,\" e.g., Chicago v. Atchison, T.  S. F. R. Co., 357 U.S. 77, 83 (1958), I have no doubt that she has standing to challenge the restriction's validity whether she acquired title to the property before or after the regulation was adopted. For, as the Court correctly observes, even future generations \"have a right to challenge unreasonable limitations on the use and value of land.\" Ante, at 18.~    ~    ~      96~      It by no means follows, however, that, as the Court assumes, a succeeding owner may obtain compensation for a taking of property from her predecessor in interest. A taking is a discrete event, a governmental acquisition of private property for which the state is required to provide just compensation. Like other transfers of property, it occurs at a particular time, that time being the moment when the relevant property interest is alienated from its owner.1~    ~    ~      97~      Precise specification of the moment a taking occurred and of the nature of the property interest taken is necessary in order to determine an appropriately compensatory remedy. For example, the amount of the award is measured by the value of the property at the time of taking, not the value at some later date. Similarly, interest on the award runs from that date. Most importantly for our purposes today, it is the person who owned the property at the time of the taking that is entitled to the recovery. See, e.g., Danforth v. United States, 308 U.S. 271, 284 (1939) (\"For the reason that compensation is due at the time of taking, the owner at that time, not the owner at an earlier or later date, receives the payment\"). The rationale behind that rule is true whether the transfer of ownership is the result of an arm's-length negotiation, an inheritance, or the dissolution of a bankrupt debtor. Cf. United States v. Dow, 357 U.S. 17, 20-21 (1958).2~    ~    II~    ~      98~      Much of the difficulty of this case stems from genuine confusion as to when the taking Palazzolo alleges actually occurred. According to Palazzolo's theory of the case, the owners of his Westerly, Rhode Island, property possessed the right to fill the wetland portion of the property at some point in the not-too-distant past.3 In 1971, the State of Rhode Island passed a statute creating the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council (Council) and delegating the Council the authority to promulgate regulations restricting the usage of coastal land. See 1971 R. I. Pub. Laws, ch. 279, 1 et seq. The Council promptly adopted regulations that, inter alia, effectively foreclosed petitioner from filling his wetlands. See ante, at 4; cf. App. to Brief for Respondents 11-22 (current version of regulations). As the regulations nonetheless provided for a process through which petitioner might seek permission to fill the wetlands, he filed two applications for such permission during the 1980s, both of which were denied. See ante, at 4-5.~    ~    ~      99~      The most natural reading of petitioner's complaint is that the regulations in and of themselves precluded him from filling the wetlands, and that their adoption therefore constituted the alleged taking. This reading is consistent with the Court's analysis in Part II-A of its opinion (which I join) in which the Court explains that petitioner's takings claims are ripe for decision because respondents' wetlands regulations unequivocally provide that there can be \"no fill for any likely or foreseeable use.\" Ante, at 11.4 If it is the regulations themselves of which petitioner complains, and if they did, in fact, diminish the value of his property, they did so when they were adopted.~    ~    ~      100~      To the extent that the adoption of the regulations constitute the challenged taking, petitioner is simply the wrong party to be bringing this action. If the regulations imposed a compensable injury on anyone, it was on the owner of the property at the moment the regulations were adopted. Given the trial court's finding that petitioner did not own the property at that time,5 in my judgment it is pellucidly clear that he has no standing to claim that the promulgation of the regulations constituted a taking of any part of the property that he subsequently acquired.~    ~    ~      101~      His lack of standing does not depend, as the Court seems to assume, on whether or not petitioner \"is deemed to have notice of an earlier-enacted restriction,\" ante, at 17. If those early regulations changed the character of the owner's title to the property, thereby diminishing its value, petitioner acquired only the net value that remained after that diminishment occurred. Of course, if, as respondent contends, see n. 3, supra, even the prior owner never had any right to fill wetlands, there never was a basis for the alleged takings claim in the first place. But accepting petitioner's theory of the case, he has no standing to complain that preacquisition events may have reduced the value of the property that he acquired. If the regulations are invalid, either because improper procedures were followed when they were adopted, or because they have somehow gone \"too far,\" Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 415 (1922), petitioner may seek to enjoin their enforcement, but he has no right to recover compensation for the value of property taken from someone else. A new owner may maintain an ejectment action against a trespasser who has lodged himself in the owner's orchard but surely could not recover damages for fruit a trespasser spirited from the orchard before he acquired the property.~    ~    ~      102~      The Court's holding in Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, 483 U.S. 825 (1987) is fully consistent with this analysis. In that case the taking occurred when the state agency compelled the petitioners to provide an easement of public access to the beach as a condition for a development permit. That event-a compelled transfer of an interest in property-occurred after the petitioners had become the owner of the property and unquestionably diminished the value of petitioners' property. Even though they had notice when they bought the property that such a taking might occur, they never contended that any action taken by the State before their purchase gave rise to any right to compensation. The matter of standing to assert a claim for just compensation is determined by the impact of the event that is alleged to have amounted to a taking rather than the sort of notice that a purchaser may or may not have received when the property was transferred. Petitioners in Nollan owned the property at the time of the triggering event. Therefore, they and they alone could claim a right to compensation for the injury.6 Their successors in interest, like petitioner in this case, have no standing to bring such a claim.~    ~    III~    ~      103~      At oral argument, petitioner contended that the taking in question occurred in 1986, when the Council denied his final application to fill the land. Tr. of Oral Arg. 16. Though this theory, to the extent that it was embraced within petitioner's actual complaint, complicates the issue, it does not alter my conclusion that the prohibition on filling the wetlands does not take from Palazzolo any property right he ever possessed.~    ~    ~      104~      The title Palazzolo took by operation of law in 1978 was limited by the regulations then in place to the extent that such regulations represented a valid exercise of the police power. For the reasons expressed above, I think the regulations barred petitioner from filling the wetlands on his property. At the very least, however, they established a rule that such lands could not be filled unless the Council exercised its authority to make exceptions to that rule under certain circumstances. Cf. App. to Brief for Respondents A-13 (laying out narrow circumstances under which the Council retains the discretion to grant a \"special exception\"). Under the reading of the regulations most favorable to Palazzolo, he acquired no more than the right to a discretionary determination by the Council as to whether to permit him to fill the wetlands. As his two hearings before that body attest, he was given the opportunity to make a presentation and receive such a determination. Thus, the Council properly respected whatever limited rights he may have retained with regard to filling the wetlands. Cf. Lujan v. G  G Fire Sprinklers, Inc., 532 U.S. ___ (2001) (holding, in a different context, that, if a party's only relevant property interest is a claim of entitlement to bring an action, the provision of a forum for hearing that action is all that is required to vindicate that property interest); Lopez v. Davis, 531 U.S. 230 (2001) (involving a federal statute that created an entitlement to a discretionary hearing without creating any entitlement to relief).7~    ~    ~      105~      Though the majority leaves open the possibility that the scope of today's holding may prove limited, see ante, at 20-21 (discussing limitations implicit in \"background principles\" exception); see also ante, at 1-4 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (discussing importance of the timing of regulations for the evaluation of the merits of a takings claim); ante, at 1-2 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (same), the extension of the right to compensation to individuals other than the direct victim of an illegal taking admits of no obvious limiting principle. If the existence of valid land-use regulations does not limit the title that the first postenactment purchaser of the property inherits, then there is no reason why such regulations should limit the rights of the second, the third, or the thirtieth purchaser. Perhaps my concern is unwarranted, but today's decision does raise the spectre of a tremendous-and tremendously capricious-one-time transfer of wealth from society at large to those individuals who happen to hold title to large tracts of land at the moment this legal question is permanently resolved.~    ~    IV~    ~      106~      In the final analysis, the property interest at stake in this litigation is the right to fill the wetlands on the tract that petitioner owns. Whether either he or his predecessors in title ever owned such an interest, and if so, when it was acquired by the State, are questions of state law. If it is clear-as I think it is and as I think the Court's disposition of the ripeness issue assumes-that any such taking occurred before he became the owner of the property, he has no standing to seek compensation for that taking. On the other hand, if the only viable takings claim has a different predicate that arose later, that claim is not ripe and the discussion in Part II-B of the Court's opinion is superfluous dictum. In either event, the judgment of the Rhode Island Supreme Court should be affirmed in its entirety.~    ~    ~      ~        Notes:~      ~      ~        1~         A regulation that goes so \"far\" that it violates the Takings Clause may give rise to an award of compensation or it may simply be invalidated as it would be if it violated any other constitutional principle (with the consequence that the State must choose between adopting a new regulatory scheme that provides compensation or forgoing regulation). While some recent Court opinions have focused on the former remedy, Justice Holmes appears to have had a regime focusing on the latter in mind in the opinion that began the modern preoccupation with \"regulatory takings.\" See Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 414 (1922) (because the statute in question takes private property without just compensation \"the act cannot be sustained\").~      ~      ~        2~         The Court argues, ante, at 18-19, that a regulatory taking is different from a direct state appropriation of property and that the rules this Court has developed for identifying the time of the latter do not apply to the former. This is something of an odd conclusion, in that the entire rationale for allowing compensation for regulations in the first place is the somewhat dubious proposition that some regulations go so \"far\" as to become the functional equivalent of a direct taking. Ultimately, the Court's regulations-are-different principle rests on the confusion of two dates: the time an injury occurs and the time a claim for compensation for that injury becomes cognizable in a judicial proceeding. That we require plaintiffs making the claim that a regulation is the equivalent of a taking to go through certain prelitigation procedures to clarify the scope of the allegedly infringing regulation does not mean that the injury did not occur before those procedures were completed. To the contrary, whenever the relevant local bodies construe their regulations, their construction is assumed to reflect \"what the [regulation] meant before as well as after the decision giving rise to that construction.\" Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., 511 U.S. 298, 312-313 (1994).~      ~      ~        3~         This point is the subject of significant dispute, as the State of Rhode Island has presented substantial evidence that limitations on coastal development have always precluded or limited schemes such as Palazzolo's. See Brief for Respondents 11-12, 41-46. Nonetheless, we must assume that it is true for the purposes of deciding this question. Likewise, we must assume for the purposes of deciding the discrete threshold questions before us that petitioner's complaint states a potentially valid regulatory takings claim. Nonetheless, for the sake of clarity it is worth emphasizing that, on my view, even a newly adopted regulation that diminishes the value of property does not produce a significant Takings Clause issue if it (1) is generally applicable and (2) is directed at preventing a substantial public harm. Cf. Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 1029 (1992) (owner of a powerplant astride an earthquake fault does not state a valid takings claim for regulation requiring closure of plant); id., at 1035 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (explaining that the government's power to regulate against harmful uses of property without paying compensation is not limited by the common law of nuisance because that doctrine is \"too narrow a confine for the exercise of regulatory power in a complex and interdependent society\"). It is quite likely that a regulation prohibiting the filling of wetlands meets those criteria.~      ~      ~        4~         At oral argument, petitioner's counsel stated: \"I think the key here is understanding that no filling of any wetland would be allowed for any reason that was lawful under the local zoning code. No structures of any kind would be permitted by Mr. Palazzolo to construct. So we know that he cannot use his wetland.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 14.~      ~      ~        5~         See App. to Pet. for Cert. A-13 (\"[T]he trial justice found that Palazzolo could not have become the owner of the property before 1978, at which time the regulations limiting his ability to fill the wetlands were already in place. The trial justice thus determined that the right to fill the wetlands was not part of Palazzolo's estate to begin with, and that he was therefore not owed any compensation for the deprivation of that right\").~      ~      ~        6~         In cases such as Nollan-in which landowners have notice of a regulation when they purchase a piece of property but the regulatory event constituting the taking does not occur until after they take title to the property-I would treat the owners' notice as relevant to the evaluation of whether the regulation goes \"too far,\" but not necessarily dispositive. See ante, at 1-4 (O'Connor, J., concurring).~      ~      ~        7~         This is not to suggest that a regulatory body can insulate all of its land-use decisions from the Takings Clause simply by referencing long-standing statutory provisions. If the determination by the regulators to reject the project involves such an unforseeable interpretation or extension of the regulation as to amount to a change in the law, then it is appropriate to consider the decision of that body, rather than the adoption of the regulation, as the discrete event that deprived the owner of a pre-existing interest in property. But, if that is petitioner's theory, his claim is not ripe for the reasons stated by Justice Ginsburg in her dissenting opinion, post, p.__. As I read petitioner's complaint and the Court's disposition of the ripeness issue, it is the regulations themselves that allegedly deprived the owner of the parcel of the right to fill the wetlands.~      ~    ~    ",

Readers are requested to notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D. C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.MELVIN TYLER, PETITIONERv.BURL CAIN, WARDEN~    No. 00-5961.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued April 16, 2001Decided June 28, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      After petitioner Tyler was convicted of second-degree murder and his conviction was affirmed on appeal, he filed five state petitions for postconviction relief and a federal habeas petition, all of which were denied. After this Court decided Cage v. Louisiana, 498 U.S. 39-under which a jury instruction is unconstitutional if there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury understood it to allow conviction without proof beyond a reasonable doubt-Tyler filed a sixth state petition, claiming that a jury instruction in his trial was substantively identical to the one condemned in Cage. The State District Court denied relief, and the State Supreme Court affirmed. Seeking to pursue his Cage claim in federal court, Tyler moved the Fifth Circuit for permission to file a second habeas application, as required by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). The court granted the motion. The District Court then proceeded to the merits of Tyler's claim and denied relief. Although the Fifth Circuit affirmed, it stated that the District Court had erred by failing first to determine whether Tyler had satisfied AEDPA's successive habeas standard, which requires a district court to dismiss a claim in a second or successive application unless, as relevant here, the applicant \"shows\" that the \"claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\" 2244(b)(2)(A) (emphasis added). Relying on Circuit precedent, the court concluded that Tyler did not meet this standard. Held: The Cage rule was not \"made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court,\" within the meaning of 2244(b)(2)(A). Pp. 4-11.~      (a) Based on 2244(b)(2)(A)'s plain meaning when read as a whole, \"made\" means \"held.\" Under the statute, this Court is the only entity that can \"ma[k]e\" a new rule retroactive. The new rule becomes retroactive, not by the decisions of the lower court or by the combined action of the Supreme Court and the lower courts, but simply by the action of the Supreme Court. The only way the Supreme Court can, by itself, lay out and construct a rule's retroactive effect is through a holding. This Court does not \"ma[k]e\" a rule retroactive when it merely establishes principles of retroactivity and leaves their application to lower courts. In such an event, the lower court (or perhaps a combination of courts), not the Supreme Court, develops any legal conclusion derived from those principles. Although the statute uses the word \"made,\" not \"held,\" Congress is permitted to use synonyms in a statute, see Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, and \"made\" and \"held\" are synonyms in the 2244(b)(2)(A) context. This interpretation is necessary for the proper implementation of AEDPA's collateral review structure. The stringent 30-day time period that 2244(b)(3)(D) imposes on courts of appeals determining whether an application \"makes a prima facie showing that [it] satisfies the [second habeas standard],\" 2244(b)(3)(C), suggests that those courts do not have to engage in the difficult legal analysis that can be required to determine questions of retroactivity in the first instance, but need only rely on Supreme Court retroactivity holdings. Pp. 5-7.~      (b) The Cage rule has not been \"made retroactive ... by the Supreme Court.\" Cage did not make itself retroactive, and neither did Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275, 279. Tyler contends that Sullivan's reasoning makes it clear that retroactive application of Cage is warranted by the principles of Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 311-313, in which the Court held that a new rule can be retroactive to cases on collateral review only if it falls within one of two narrow exceptions to the general rule of nonretroactivity. However, the most Tyler can claim is that, based on Teague's principles, this Court should make Cage retroactive to cases on collateral review. It is clear, however, that the Court has not done so. Although the Court can make a rule retroactive over the course of two cases, it has not done so here. Pp. 7-10.~      (c) This Court declines to make Cage retroactive today. Because Tyler's habeas application was his second, the District Court was required to dismiss it unless Tyler showed that this Court already had made Cage retroactive. This Court cannot decide today whether Cage is retroactive to cases on collateral review, because that decision will not help Tyler in this case. Any statement on Cage's retroactivity would be dictum, so this Court declines to comment further on the issue.

Louisiana, 498 U.S. 39 (1990) (per curiam), a jury instruction is unconstitutional if there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the instruction to allow conviction without proof beyond a reasonable doubt.1 In this case, we must decide whether this rule was \"made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court.\" 28 U.S.C.  2244(b)(2)(A) (1994 ed., Supp. V). We hold that it was not.~    ~    ~      2~      * During a fight with his estranged girlfriend in March 1975, petitioner Melvin Tyler shot and killed their 20-day-old daughter. A jury found Tyler guilty of second-degree murder, and his conviction was affirmed on appeal. After sentencing, Tyler assiduously sought postconviction relief. By 1986, he had filed five state petitions, all of which were denied. See State ex rel. Tyler v. Blackburn, 494 So. 2d 1171 (La. 1986); State v. Tyler, 446 So. 2d 1226 (La. 1984); State ex rel. Tyler v. State, 437 So. 2d 1142 (La. 1983); State v. Tyler, 430 So. 2d 92 (La. 1983); State ex rel. Tyler v. Maggio, 428 So. 2d 483 (La. 1982). He next filed a federal habeas petition, which was unsuccessful as well. Tyler v. Butler, No. 88cv4929 (ED La.), aff'd, Tyler v. Whitley, 920 F.2d 929 (CA5 1990). After this Court's decision in Cage, Tyler continued his efforts. Because the jury instruction defining reasonable doubt at Tyler's trial was substantively identical to the instruction condemned in Cage, Tyler filed a sixth state postconviction petition, this time raising a Cage claim. The State District Court denied relief, and the Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed. State ex rel. Tyler v. Cain, 684 So. 2d 950 (1996).~    ~    ~      3~      In early 1997, Tyler returned to federal court. Seeking to pursue his Cage claim, Tyler moved the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for permission to file a second habeas corpus application, as required by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214.2 The Court of Appeals recognized that it could not grant the motion unless Tyler made \"a prima facie showing,\" 2244(b)(3)(C), that his \"claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable,\" 2244(b)(2)(A). Finding that Tyler had made the requisite prima facie showing, the Court of Appeals granted the motion, thereby allowing Tyler to file a habeas petition in District Court.~    ~    ~      4~      The District Court proceeded to the merits of Tyler's claim and held that, although Cage should apply retroactively, App. 5-7 (citing Humphrey v. Cain, 138 F.3d 552 (CA5 1998) (en banc)), Tyler was not entitled to collateral relief. Under AEDPA, a state prisoner can prevail only if the state court's decision \"was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" 2254(d)(1). Concluding that Tyler could not overcome this barrier, the District Court denied his petition.~    ~    ~      5~      The Court of Appeals affirmed. Judgt. order reported at 218 F.3d 744 (CA5 2000). It stated, however, that the District Court erred by failing first to determine whether Tyler \"satisfied AEDPA's successive habeas standard.\" App. 15. AEDPA requires a district court to dismiss a claim in a second or successive application unless, as relevant here, the applicant \"shows\" that the \"claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable,\"3 2244(b)(2)(A) (emphasis added); 2244(b)(4). Relying on Circuit precedent, see Brown v. Lensing, 171 F.3d 1031 (CA5 1999); In re Smith, 142 F.3d 832 (CA5 1998), the Court of Appeals concluded that Tyler did not meet this standard because he \"could not show that any Supreme Court decision renders the Cage decision retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.\" App. 15.~    ~    ~      6~      The Courts of Appeals are divided on the question whether Cage was \"made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court,\" as required by 28 U.S.C.  2244(b)(2)(A). Compare Rodriguez v. Superintendent, 139 F.3d 270 (CA1 1998) (holding that Cage has not been made retroactive by the Supreme Court); Brown, supra (same); In re Hill, 113 F.3d 181 (CA11 1997) (same), with West v. Vaughn, 204 F.3d 53 (CA3 2000) (holding that Cage has been made retroactive to cases on collateral review). To resolve this conflict, we granted certiorari. 531 U.S. 1051 (2000).~    ~    II~    ~      7~      AEDPA greatly restricts the power of federal courts to award relief to state prisoners who file second or successive habeas corpus applications. If the prisoner asserts a claim that he has already presented in a previous federal habeas petition, the claim must be dismissed in all cases. 2244(b)(1). And if the prisoner asserts a claim that was not presented in a previous petition, the claim must be dismissed unless it falls within one of two narrow exceptions. One of these exceptions is for claims predicated on newly discovered facts that call into question the accuracy of a guilty verdict. 2244(b)(2)(B). The other is for certain claims relying on new rules of constitutional law. 2244(b)(2)(A).~    ~    ~      8~      It is the latter exception that concerns us today. Specifically, 2244(b)(2)(A) covers claims that \"rel[y] on a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\" This provision establishes three prerequisites to obtaining relief in a second or successive petition: First, the rule on which the claim relies must be a \"new rule\" of constitutional law; second, the rule must have been \"made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court\"; and third, the claim must have been \"previously unavailable.\" In this case, the parties ask us to interpret only the second requirement; respondent does not dispute that Cage created a \"new rule\" that was \"previously unavailable.\" Based on the plain meaning of the text read as a whole, we conclude that \"made\" means \"held\" and, thus, the requirement is satisfied only if this Court has held that the new rule is retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.~    ~    ~      9~      * As commonly defined, \"made\" has several alternative meanings, none of which is entirely free from ambiguity. See, e.g., Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 718-719 (1991) (defining \"to make\" as \"to cause to happen,\" \"to cause to exist, occur or appear,\" \"to lay out and construct,\" and \"to cause to act in a certain way\"). Out of context, it may thus be unclear which meaning should apply in 2244(b)(2)(A), and how the term should be understood. We do not, however, construe the meaning of statutory terms in a vacuum. Rather, we interpret the words \"in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\" Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 809 (1989). In 2244(b)(2)(A), the word \"made\" falls within a clause that reads as follows: \"[A] new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court.\" (Emphasis added.) Quite significantly, under this provision, the Supreme Court is the only entity that can \"ma[k]e\" a new rule retroactive. The new rule becomes retroactive, not by the decisions of the lower court or by the combined action of the Supreme Court and the lower courts, but simply by the action of the Supreme Court.~    ~    ~      10~      The only way the Supreme Court can, by itself, \"lay out and construct\" a rule's retroactive effect, or \"cause\" that effect \"to exist, occur, or appear,\" is through a holding. The Supreme Court does not \"ma[k]e\" a rule retroactive when it merely establishes principles of retroactivity and leaves the application of those principles to lower courts. In such an event, any legal conclusion that is derived from the principles is developed by the lower court (or perhaps by a combination of courts), not by the Supreme Court.4 We thus conclude that a new rule is not \"made retroactive to cases on collateral review\" unless the Supreme Court holds it to be retroactive.5~    ~    ~      11~      To be sure, the statute uses the word \"made,\" not \"held.\" But we have already stated, in a decision interpreting another provision of AEDPA, that Congress need not use the word \"held\" to require as much. In Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362 (2000), we concluded that the phrase \"clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\" 2254(d)(1) (emphasis added), \"refers to the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Court's decisions,\" id., at 412. The provision did not use the word \"held,\" but the effect was the same. Congress, needless to say, is permitted to use synonyms in a statute. And just as \"determined\" and \"held\" are synonyms in the context of 2254(d)(1), \"made\" and \"held\" are synonyms in the context of 2244(b)(2)(A).~    ~    ~      12~      We further note that our interpretation is necessary for the proper implementation of the collateral review structure created by AEDPA. Under the statute, before a state prisoner may file a second or successive habeas application, he \"shall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.\" 2244(b)(3)(A). The court of appeals must make a decision on the application within 30 days. 2244(b)(3)(D). In this limited time, the court of appeals must determine whether the application \"makes a prima facie showing that [it] satisfies the [second habeas standard].\" 2244(b)(3)(C). It is unlikely that a court of appeals could make such a determination in the allotted time if it had to do more than simply rely on Supreme Court holdings on retroactivity. The stringent time limit thus suggests that the courts of appeals do not have to engage in the difficult legal analysis that can be required to determine questions of retroactivity in the first instance.~    ~    B~    ~      13~      Because \"made\" means \"held\" for purposes of 2244(b)(1)(A), it is clear that the Cage rule has not been \"made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court.\" Cage itself does not hold that it is retroactive. The only holding in Cage is that the particular jury instruction violated the Due Process Clause.~    ~    ~      14~      Tyler argues, however, that a subsequent case, Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275 (1993), made the Cage rule retroactive. But Sullivan held only that a Cage error is structural-i.e., it is not amenable to harmless-error analysis and \"will always invalidate the conviction.\" 508 U.S., at 279. Conceding that the holding in Sullivan does not render Cage retroactive to cases on collateral review, Tyler contends that the reasoning in Sullivan makes clear that retroactive application is warranted by the principles of Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989). Under Teague, a new rule can be retroactive to cases on collateral review if, and only if, it falls within one of two narrow exceptions to the general rule of nonretroactivity. Id., at 311-313 (plurality opinion). See also O'Dell v. Netherland, 521 U.S. 151, 156-157 (1997). The exception relevant here is for \"watershed rules of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\" Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S 461, 478 (1993). To fall within this exception, a new rule must meet two requirements: Infringement of the rule must \"seriously diminish the likelihood of obtaining an accurate conviction,\" and the rule must \" ' \"alter our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements\" ' essential to the fairness of a proceeding.\" Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U.S. 227, 242 (1990) (quoting Teague, supra, at 311 (plurality opinion), in turn quoting Mackey v. United States, 401 U.S. 667, 693 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring in judgments in part and dissenting in part)).~    ~    ~      15~      According to Tyler, the reasoning of Sullivan demonstrates that the Cage rule satisfies both prongs of this Teague exception. First, Tyler notes, Sullivan repeatedly emphasized that a Cage error fundamentally undermines the reliability of a trial's outcome. And second, Tyler contends, the central point of Sullivan is that a Cage error deprives a defendant of a bedrock element of procedural fairness: the right to have the jury make the determination of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Tyler's arguments fail to persuade, however. The most he can claim is that, based on the principles outlined in Teague, this Court should make Cage retroactive to cases on collateral review. What is clear, however, is that we have not \"made\" Cage retroactive to cases on collateral review.6~    ~    ~      16~      Justice Breyer observes that this Court can make a rule retroactive over the course of two cases. See post, at 3 (dissenting opinion). We do not disagree that, with the right combination of holdings, the Court could do this. But even so, the Court has not made Cage retroactive. Multiple cases can render a new rule retroactive only if the holdings in those cases necessarily dictate retroactivity of the new rule. The only holding in Sullivan is that a Cage error is structural error. There is no second case that held that all structural-error rules apply retroactively or that all structural-error rules fit within the second Teague exception. The standard for determining whether an error is structural, see generally Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279 (1991), is not coextensive with the second Teague exception,7 and a holding that a particular error is structural does not logically dictate the conclusion that the second Teague exception has been met.~    ~    III~    ~      17~      Finally, Tyler suggests that, if Cage has not been made retroactive to cases on collateral review, we should make it retroactive today. We disagree. Because Tyler's habeas application was his second, the District Court was required to dismiss it unless Tyler showed that this Court already had made Cage retroactive. 2244(b)(4) (\"A district court shall dismiss any claim presented in a second or successive application that the court of appeals has authorized to be filed unless the applicant shows that the claim satisfies the requirements of this section\"); 2244(b)(2)(A) (\"A claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was not presented in a prior application shall be dismissed unless ... the applicant shows that the claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable\"). We cannot decide today whether Cage is retroactive to cases on collateral review, because that decision would not help Tyler in this case. Any statement on Cage's retroactivity would be dictum, so we decline to comment further on the issue.~    ~    ~      18~      * * *~    ~    ~      19~      The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.~    ~    ~      20~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      21~      O'Connor, J., filed a concurring opinion.~    ~    ~      22~      Breyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg, JJ., joined.~    ~    ~      ~        Notes:~      ~      ~        1~         In Cage, this Court observed that a reasonable juror \"could have\" interpreted the instruction at issue to permit a finding of guilt without the requisite proof. 498 U.S., at 41. In Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 72, and n. 4 (1991), however, this Court made clear that the proper inquiry is not whether the instruction \"could have\" been applied unconstitutionally, but whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury did so apply it. See also Victor v. Nebraska, 511 U.S. 1, 6 (1994) (\"The constitutional question in the present cases ... is whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the instructions to allow conviction based on proof insufficient to meet the [constitutional] standard\").~      ~      ~        2~         AEDPA requires that, \"[b]efore a second or successive application ... is filed in the district court, the applicant shall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.\" 28 U.S.C.  2244(b)(3)(A) (1994 ed., Supp. V).~      ~      ~        3~         This requirement differs from the one that applicants must satisfy in order to obtain permission from a court of appeals to file a second or successive petition. As noted above, a court of appeals may authorize such a filing only if it determines that the applicant makes a \"prima facie showing\" that the application satisfies the statutory standard. 2244(b)(3)(C). But to survive dismissal in district court, the applicant must actually \"sho[w]\" that the claim satisfies the standard.~      ~      ~        4~         Similarly, the Supreme Court does not make a rule retroactive through dictum, which is not binding. Cf. Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 67 (1996) (contrasting dictum with holdings, which include the final disposition of a case as well as the preceding determinations \"necessary to that result\" (emphasis added)).~      ~      ~        5~         Tyler argues that defining \"made\" to mean \"held\" would create an anomaly: When it is obvious that a rule should be retroactive, the courts of appeals will not be in conflict, and this Court will never decide to hear the case and will never make the rule retroactive. Thus, Tyler concludes, we should construe 2244(b)(2)(A) to allow for retroactive application whenever the \"principles\" of our decisions, as interpreted by the courts of appeals, indicate that retroactivity is appropriate. This argument is flawed, however. First, even if we disagreed with the legislative decision to establish stringent procedural requirements for retroactive application of new rules, we do not have license to question the decision on policy grounds. See Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 253-254 (1992). Second, the \"anomalous\" result that Tyler predicts is speculative at best, because AEDPA does not limit our discretion to grant certiorari to cases in which the courts of appeals have reached divergent results.~      ~      ~        6~         We also reject Tyler's attempt to find support in our disposition in Adams v. Evatt, 511 U.S. 1001 (1994). In Adams, we vacated an opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which had held that Cage was not retroactive, and remanded for further consideration in light of Sullivan. Our order, however, was not a \"final determination on the merits.\" Henry v. Rock Hill, 376 U.S. 776, 777 (1964) (per curiam). It simply indicated that, in light of \"intervening developments,\" there was a \"reasonable probability\" that the Court of Appeals would reject a legal premise on which it relied and which may affect the outcome of the litigation. Lawrence v. Chater, 516 U.S. 163, 167 (1996) (per curiam).~      ~      ~        7~         As explained above, the second Teague exception is available only if the new rule \" ' \"alter[s] our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements\" ' essential to the fairness of a proceeding.\" Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U.S. 227, 242 (1990) (quoting Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 311 (1989) (plurality opinion), in turn quoting Mackey v. United States, 401 U.S. 667, 693 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring in judgments in part and dissenting in part) (emphasis added)). Classifying an error as structural does not necessarily alter our understanding of these bedrock procedural elements. Nor can it be said that all new rules relating to due process (or even the \"fundamental requirements of due process,\" see post, at 5 (dissenting opinion)) alter such understanding. See, e.g., Sawyer, supra, at 244 (holding that the rule in Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U.S. 320 (1985), did not fit within the second Teague exception even though it \"added to an existing guarantee of due process protection against fundamental unfairness\"); O'Dell v. Netherland, 521 U.S. 151, 167 (1997) (holding that the rule in Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154 (1994), which has been described as serving \"one of the hallmarks of due process,\" id., at 175 (O'Connor, J, concurring in judgment), did not fit within the second Teague exception). On the contrary, the second Teague exception is reserved only for truly \"watershed\" rules. See O'Dell, supra, at 167; see also Caspari v. Bohlen, 510 U.S. 383, 396 (1994) (describing such rules as \"groundbreaking\"); Graham v. Collins, 506 U.S. 461, 478 (1993) (explaining that the exception is limited to \"a small core of rules,\" which not only seriously enhance accuracy but also \"requir[e] 'observance of those procedures that ... are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty' \") (quoting Teague, supra, at 311 (internal quotation marks omitted)); Saffle v. Parks, 494 U.S. 484, 495 (1990) (focusing on \"primacy and centrality\" of the rule). As we have recognized, it is unlikely that any of these watershed rules \"ha[s] yet to emerge.\" Sawyer, supra, at 243 (quoting Teague, supra, at 313 (plurality opinion)); see also Graham, supra, at 478.~      ~    ~    ~      23~      Justice O'Connor, concurring.~    ~    ~      24~      I join the Court's opinion and write separately to explain more fully the circumstances in which a new rule is \"made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court.\" 28 U.S.C.  2244(b)(2)(A) (1994 ed., Supp. V).~    ~    ~      25~      It is only through the holdings of this Court, as opposed to this Court's dicta and as opposed to the decisions of any other court, that a new rule is \"made retroactive . . . by the Supreme Court\" within the meaning of 2244(b)(2)(A). See ante, at 5-6; cf. Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 412 (2000). The clearest instance, of course, in which we can be said to have \"made\" a new rule retroactive is where we expressly have held the new rule to be retroactive in a case on collateral review and applied the rule to that case. But, as the Court recognizes, a single case that expressly holds a rule to be retroactive is not a sine qua non for the satisfaction of this statutory provision. Ante, at 9. This Court instead may \"ma[k]e\" a new rule retroactive through multiple holdings that logically dictate the retroactivity of the new rule. Ibid. To apply the syllogistic relationship described by Justice Breyer, post, at 3 (dissenting opinion), if we hold in Case One that a particular type of rule applies retroactively to cases on collateral review and hold in Case Two that a given rule is of that particular type, then it necessarily follows that the given rule applies retroactively to cases on collateral review. In such circumstances, we can be said to have \"made\" the given rule retroactive to cases on collateral review.~    ~    ~      26~      The relationship between the conclusion that a new rule is retroactive and the holdings that \"ma[k]e\" this rule retroactive, however, must be strictly logical-i.e., the holdings must dictate the conclusion and not merely provide principles from which one may conclude that the rule applies retroactively. As the Court observes, \"[t]he Supreme Court does not 'ma[k]e' a rule retroactive when it merely establishes principles of retroactivity and leaves the application of those principles to lower courts.\" Ante, at 6. The Court instead can be said to have \"made\" a rule retroactive within the meaning of 2244(b)(2)(A) only where the Court's holdings logically permit no other conclusion than that the rule is retroactive.~    ~    ~      27~      It is relatively easy to demonstrate the required logical relationship with respect to the first exception articulated in Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989). Under this exception, \"a new rule should be applied retroactively if it places 'certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe.' \" Id., at 307 (plurality opinion) (quoting Mackey v. United States, 401 U.S. 667, 692 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring in judgments in part and dissenting in part)). When the Court holds as a new rule in a subsequent case that a particular species of primary, private individual conduct is beyond the power of the criminal lawmaking authority to proscribe, it necessarily follows that this Court has \"made\" that new rule retroactive to cases on collateral review. The Court has done so through its holdings alone, without resort to dicta and without any application of principles by lower courts.~    ~    ~      28~      The matter is less straightforward with respect to the second Teague exception, which is reserved for \"watershed rules of criminal procedure,\" 489 U.S., at 311 (plurality opinion). A case announcing a new rule could conceivably hold that infringement of the rule \"seriously diminish[es] the likelihood of obtaining an accurate conviction,\" id., at 315, and that the rule \" 'alter[s] our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements essential to the fairness of a proceeding,' \" id., at 311 (plurality opinion) (quoting Mackey, supra, at 693 (Harlan, J., concurring in judgments in part and dissenting in part)); see also Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U.S. 227, 242 (1990), without holding in so many words that the rule \"applies retroactively\" and without actually applying that rule retroactively to a case on collateral review. The \"precise contours\" of this Teague exception, of course, \"may be difficult to discern,\" Saffle v. Parks, 494 U.S. 484, 495 (1990), and the judgment involved in our \"ma[king]\" a new rule retroactive under this exception is likely to be more subjective and self-conscious than is the case with Teague's first exception. But the relevant inquiry is not whether the new rule comes within the Teague exception at all, but the more narrow and manageable inquiry of whether this Court's holdings, by strict logical necessity, \"ma[k]e\" the new rule retroactive within the meaning of 2244(b)(2)(A). While such logical necessity does not obtain in this particular case, ante, at 8-10, this Court could \"ma[k]e\" a new rule retroactive under Teague's second exception in this manner.~    ~    ~      29~      Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.~    ~    ~      30~      In Cage v. Louisiana, 498 U.S. 39 (1990) (per curiam), this Court held that a certain jury instruction violated the Constitution because it inaccurately defined \"reasonable doubt,\" thereby permitting a jury to convict \"based on a degree of proof below that required by the Due Process Clause.\" Id., at 41. Here we must decide whether this Court has \"made\" Cage \"retroactive to cases on collateral review.\" 28 U.S.C.  2244(b)(2)(A) (1994 ed., Supp. V). I believe that it has.~    ~    ~      31~      The Court made Cage retroactive in two cases taken together. Case One is Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989). That case, as the majority says, held (among other things) that a new rule is applicable retroactively to cases on collateral review if (1) infringement of the new rule will \"seriously diminish the likelihood of obtaining an accurate conviction,\" id., at 315 (plurality opinion), and (2) the new rule \" 'alter[s] our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements that must be found to vitiate the fairness of a particular conviction,' \" id., at 311 (plurality opinion) (quoting Mackey v. United States, 401 U.S. 667, 693 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring in judgments in part and dissenting in part)) (emphasis deleted).~    ~    ~      32~      Case Two is Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275 (1993). This Court decided Sullivan after several lower courts had held that Cage's rule did not fall within the Teague \"watershed\" exception I have just mentioned. See, e.g., Adams v. Aiken, 965 F.2d 1306, 1312 (CA4 1992), vacated, 511 U.S. 1001 (1994); Skelton v. Whitley, 950 F.2d 1037, 1045 (CA5), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 833 (1992). The question in Sullivan was whether a violation of the Cage rule could ever count as harmless error. The Court answered that question in the negative. In so concluding, the Court reasoned that an instruction that violated Cage by misdescribing the concept of reasonable doubt \"vitiates all the jury's findings,\" and deprives a criminal defendant of a \"basic protection ... without which a criminal trial cannot reliably serve its function.\" Sullivan, supra, at 281 (emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted). It renders the situation as if \"there has been no jury verdict within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment.\" 508 U.S., at 280.~    ~    ~      33~      To reason as the Court reasoned in Sullivan is to hold (in Teague's language) (1) that infringement of the Cage rule \"seriously diminish[es] the likelihood of obtaining an accurate conviction,\" Teague, supra, at 315 (plurality opinion), and (2) that Cage \"alter[s] our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements\" that are essential to the fairness of a criminal trial, 489 U.S., at 311 (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis deleted). That is because an instruction that makes \"all the jury's findings\" untrustworthy, Sullivan, supra, at 281, must \"diminish the likelihood of obtaining an accurate conviction,\" Teague, supra, at 315 (plurality opinion). It is because a deprivation of a \"basic protection\" needed for a trial to \"serve its function,\" Sullivan, supra, at 281 (internal quotation marks omitted), is a deprivation of a \"bedrock procedural elemen[t],\" Teague, supra, at 311 (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted). And it is because Cage significantly \"alter[ed]\" pre-existing law. 489 U.S., at 311. That is what every Court of Appeals to have considered the matter has concluded. See Tillman v. Cook, 215 F.3d 1116, 1122 (CA10), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1055 (2000); West v. Vaughn, 204 F.3d 53, 61, and n. 9 (CA3 2000); Gaines v. Kelly, 202 F.3d 598, 604-605 (CA2 2000); Humphrey v. Cain, 138 F.3d 552, 553 (CA5) (en banc), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 935 (1998); Adams v. Aiken, 41 F.3d 175, 178-179 (CA4 1994), cert. denied, 515 U.S. 1124 (1995); Nutter v. White, 39 F.3d 1154, 1158 (CA11 1994). But cf. In re Smith, 142 F.3d 832, 835-836 (CA5 1998) (concluding that explicit Supreme Court statement is necessary to make Cage retroactive for second or successive habeas purposes); Rodriguez v. Superintendent, Bay State Correctional Ctr., 139 F.3d 270, 275-276 (CA1 1998) (same); In re Hill, 113 F.3d 181, 184 (CA11 1997) (same). And I do not see how the majority can deny that this is so.~    ~    ~      34~      Consequently, Sullivan, in holding that a Cage violation can never be harmless because it leaves the defendant with no jury verdict known to the Sixth Amendment, also holds that Cage falls within Teague's \"watershed\" exception. The matter is one of logic. If Case One holds that all men are mortal and Case Two holds that Socrates is a man, we do not need Case Three to hold that Socrates is mortal. It is also a matter of law. If Case One holds that a party's expectation measures damages for breach of contract and Case Two holds that Circumstances X, Y, and Z create a binding contract, we do not need Case Three to hold that in those same circumstances expectation damages are awarded for breach. Ordinarily, in law, to hold that a set of circumstances falls within a particular legal category is simultaneously to hold that, other things being equal, the normal legal characteristics of members of that category apply to those circumstances.~    ~    ~      35~      The majority says that Sullivan's only \"holding\" is that Cage error is structural, and that this \"holding\" does not dictate the \"watershed\" nature of the Cage rule. See ante, at 8-9. But the majority fails to identify a meaningful difference between the definition of a watershed rule under Teague and the standard that we have articulated in the handful of instances in which we have held errors structural, namely, that structural errors deprive a defendant of a \" 'basic protectio[n]' \" without which a \" 'trial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence' \" to the point where \" 'no criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.' \" Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 310 (1991) (quoting Rose v. Clark, 478 U.S. 570, 577-578 (1986)); see also Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 8 (1999) (identifying the six kinds of error, including Cage error, that have been held structural). In principle Teague also adds an element that \"structural error\" alone need not encompass, namely, the requirement that a violation of the rule must undermine accuracy. But that additional accuracy requirement poses no problem here, for our language in Sullivan could not have made clearer that Cage error seriously undermines the accuracy and reliability of a guilty verdict.~    ~    ~      36~      Of course, as the majority points out, identifying an error as structural need not \"alter our understanding of th[e] fundamental procedural elements\" that are essential to a fair trial. See ante, at 10, n. 7. But this \"altering\" requirement is not a problem here. No one denies that Cage's rule was a new one. \"Whether a trial court's unconstitutional misdescription of the burden of proof in a criminal case violates the Due Process Clause was certainly an open question before Cage.\" Adams, 41 F.3d, at 178; see also Gaines, supra, at 606-607 (noting that Cage led to reversals of numerous convictions that had been based on similar reasonable doubt instruction); State v. Humphrey, 544 So. 2d 1188, 1192 (La. App.) (citing multiple decisions by Louisiana Supreme Court which had upheld reasonable doubt instructions like that invalidated in Cage), cert. denied, 550 So. 2d 627 (1989). And our holding that such a misdescription of the burden of proof means that \"there has been no jury verdict within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment,\" Sullivan, 508 U.S., at 280, certainly altered the understanding of the significance of such an error.~    ~    ~      37~      Insofar as the majority means to suggest that a rule may be sufficiently \"new\" that it does not apply retroactively but not \"new enough\" to qualify for the watershed exception, I note only that the cases establishing this exception suggest no such requirement. Rather than focus on the \"degree of newness\" of a new rule, these decisions emphasize that watershed rules are those that form part of the fundamental requirements of due process. See Teague, 489 U.S., at 311-312 (plurality opinion); Mackey, 401 U.S., at 693-694 (Harlan, J., concurring in judgments in part and dissenting in part); cf. O'Dell v. Netherland, 521 U.S. 151, 167 (1997) (holding that \"narrow right of rebuttal\" established by Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154 (1994), \"has hardly alter[ed] our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements essential to the fairness of a proceeding\" (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original)); Caspari v. Bohlen, 510 U.S. 383, 396 (1994) (holding that application of double jeopardy bar to successive noncapital sentencing would not be unfair and would enhance rather than hinder accuracy); Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U.S. 227, 242-244 (1990) (holding that rule which \"provid[ed] an additional measure of protection\" to existing prohibition on prosecutorial remarks that render a proceeding \"fundamentally unfair\" was not \"an 'absolute prerequisite to fundamental fairness' \" that would fall within the second Teague exception) (quoting Teague, supra, at 314 (plurality opinion)).~    ~    ~      38~      Nor does the majority explain why the reasoning that was necessary to our holding in Sullivan (and is therefore binding upon all courts) lacks enough legal force to \"make\" the Cage rule retroactive. Cf. Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 67 (1996) (\"We adhere ... not to mere obiter dicta, but rather to the well-established rationale upon which the Court based the results of its earlier decisions. When an opinion issues for the Court, it is not only the result but also those portions of the opinion necessary to that result by which we are bound\"); Burnham v. Superior Court of Cal., County of Marin, 495 U.S. 604, 613, n. 2 (1990) (plurality opinion) (exclusive basis for judgment is not dicta). In any event, technical issues about what constitutes a \"holding\" are beside the point. The statutory provision before us does not use the words \"holding\" or \"held.\" But cf. ante, at 7 (majority opinion) (stating without explanation that \"made\" means \"held\"). It uses the word \"made.\" It refers to instances in which the Supreme Court has \"made\" a rule of law \"retroactive to cases on collateral review.\" 28 U.S.C.  2244(b)(2)(A) (1994 ed., Supp. V) (emphasis added). And that is just what the Supreme Court, through Teague and Sullivan, has done with respect to the rule of Cage.~    ~    ~      39~      I agree with Justice O'Connor-as does a majority of the Court-when (in describing a different Teague exception) she says that \"[w]hen the Court holds as a new rule in a subsequent case that a particular species of primary, private individual conduct is beyond the power of the criminal lawmaking authority to proscribe, it necessarily follows that this Court has 'made' that new rule retroactive to cases on collateral review.\" Ante, at 2 (concurring opinion). But I do not understand why a decision by this Court which makes it apparent that a rule is retroactive under Teague's second exception will necessarily be \"more subjective and self-conscious.\" Ante, at 3 (concurring opinion). Of course, it will sometimes be difficult to decide whether an earlier Supreme Court case has satisfied the watershed rule's requirements. But that is not so here. In Sullivan, this Court used language that unmistakably stated that a defective reasonable-doubt instruction undermines the accuracy of a trial and deprives the defendant of a bedrock element that is essential to the fairness of a criminal proceeding. That is sufficient to make Teague's watershed exception applicable.~    ~    ~      40~      I would add two further points. First, nothing in the statute's purpose favors, let alone requires, the majority's conclusion. That purpose, as far as I can surmise, is to bar successive petitions when lower courts, but not the Supreme Court, have held a rule not to be \"new\" under Teague because dictated by their own precedent, cf. Dyer v. Calderon, 151 F.3d 970, 993-995 (CA9) (en banc) (O'Scannlain, J., dissenting) (rejecting proposition that lower court decisions can establish rule for Teague purposes), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1033 (1998); Clemmons v. Delo, 124 F.3d 944, 955, n. 11 (CA8 1997) (assuming, without deciding, that only Supreme Court precedent may dictate rule so that it is not new for Teague purposes), cert. denied, 523 U. S 1088 (1998), or when lower courts have themselves adopted new rules and then determined that the Teague retroactivity factors apply, see Smith v. Groose, 205 F.3d 1045, 1054 (CA8) (holding that Circuit rule that prosecution's use of contradictory theories violates due process would fall within Teague's \"watershed\" exception), cert. denied sub nom. Gammon v. Smith, 531 U.S. 985 (2000); Sanders v. Sullivan, 900 F.2d 601, 606-607 (CA2 1990) (same, with respect to Circuit rule that prosecution's unknowing use of material, perjured testimony violates Constitution). Here, consistent with such a purpose, the Supreme Court has previously spoken.~    ~    ~      41~      Second, the most likely consequence of the majority's holding is further procedural complexity. After today's opinion, the only way in which this Court can make a rule such as Cage's retroactive is to repeat its Sullivan reasoning in a case triggered by a prisoner's filing a first habeas petition (a \"second or successive\" petition itself being barred by the provision here at issue) or in some other case that presents the issue in a posture that allows such language to have the status of a \"holding.\" Then, after the Court takes the case and says that it meant what it previously said, prisoners could file \"second or successive\" petitions to take advantage of the now-clearly-made-applicable new rule. We will be required to restate the obvious, case by case, even when we have explicitly said, but not \"held,\" that a new rule is retroactive. See, e.g., Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 330 (1989) (stating that, if Court were to hold that Eighth Amendment prohibits execution of persons with mental retardation, this rule would be retroactively applicable on collateral review).~    ~    ~      42~      Even this complex route will remain open only if the relevant statute of limitations is interpreted to permit its 1-year filing period to run from the time that this Court has \"made\" a new rule retroactive, not from the time it initially recognized that new right. See 28 U.S.C.  2244(d)(1)(C) (1994 ed., Supp. V) (limitations period runs from \"the date on which the constitutional right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if the right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review\"). Otherwise, the Court's approach will generate not only complexity, along with its attendant risk of confusion, but also serious additional unfairness.~    ~    ~      43~      I do not understand the basis for the Court's approach. I fear its consequences. For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.~    ~    ",

After the Department began developing the Klamath Project Operation Plan (Plan) to provide water allocations among competing uses and users, the Department asked the Klamath and other Indian Tribes (Basin Tribes or Tribes) to consult with Reclamation on the matter. A memorandum of understanding between those parties called for assessment, in consultation with the Tribes, of the impacts of the Plan on tribal trust resources. During roughly the same period, the Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs (Bureau) filed claims on behalf of the Klamath Tribe in an Oregon state-court adjudication intended to allocate water rights. Since the Bureau is responsible for administering land and water held in trust for Indian tribes, it consulted with the Klamath Tribe, and the two exchanged written memorandums on the appropriate scope of the claims ultimately submitted by the Government for the benefit of the Tribe. Respondent Klamath Water Users Protective Association (Association) is a nonprofit group, most of whose members receive water from the Project and have interests adverse to the tribal interests owing to scarcity of water. The Association filed a series of requests with the Bureau under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C.  552 seeking access to communications between the Bureau and the Basin Tribes. The Bureau turned over several documents, but withheld others under the attorney work product and deliberative process privileges that are said to be incorporated in FOIA Exemption 5, which exempts from disclosure \"inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency,\" 552(b)(5). The Association then sued the Bureau under FOIA to compel release of the documents. The District Court granted the Government summary judgment. The Ninth Circuit reversed, ruling out any application of Exemption 5 on the ground that the Tribes with whom the Department has a consulting relationship have a direct interest in the subject matter of the consultations. The court said that to hold otherwise would extend Exemption 5 to shield what amount to ex parte communications in contested proceedings between the Tribes and the Department.~      Held: The documents at issue are not exempt from FOIA's disclosure requirements as \"inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters.\" Pp. 4-14.~      (a) Consistent with FOIA's goal of broad disclosure, its exemptions have been consistently given a narrow compass. E.g., Department of Justice v. Tax Analysts, 492 U.S. 136, 151. Pp. 4-5.~      (b) To qualify under Exemption 5's express terms, a document must satisfy two conditions: its source must be a Government agency, and it must fall within the ambit of a privilege against discovery under judicial standards that would govern litigation against the agency that holds the document. This Court's prior Exemption 5 cases have addressed the second condition, and have dealt with the incorporation of civil discovery privileges. So far as they matter here, those privileges include the privilege for attorney work product and the so-called \"deliberative process\" privilege, which covers documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations, and deliberations that are part of a process by which Government decisions and policies are formulated. NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck  Co., 421 U.S. 132, 150. The point of Exemption 5 is not to protect Government secrecy pure and simple, and the Exemption's first condition is no less important than the second; the communication must be \"inter-agency or intra-agency,\" 5 U.S.C.  552(b)(5). \"[A]gency\" is defined to mean \"each authority of the Government,\" 551(1), and includes entities such as Executive Branch departments, military departments, Government corporations, Government-controlled corporations, and independent regulatory agencies, 552(f). Although Exemption 5's terms and the statutory definitions say nothing about communications with outsiders, some Courts of Appeals have held that a document prepared for a Government agency by an outside consultant qualifies as an \"intra-agency\" memorandum. In such cases, the records submitted by outside consultants played essentially the same part in an agency's deliberative process as documents prepared by agency personnel. The fact about the consultant that is constant in the cases is that the consultant does not represent its own interest, or the interest of any other client, when it advises the agency that hires it. Its only obligations are to truth and its sense of what good judgment calls for, and in those respects it functions just as an employee would be expected to do. Pp. 5-8.~      (c) The Department misplaces its reliance on this consultant corollary to Exemption 5. The Department's argument skips a necessary step, for it ignores the first condition of Exemption 5, that the communication be \"intra-agency or inter-agency.\" There is no textual justification for draining that condition of independent vitality. Once the intra-agency condition is applied, it rules out any application of Exemption 5 to tribal communications on analogy to consultants' reports (assuming, which the Court does not decide, that these reports may qualify as intra-agency under Exemption 5). Consultants whose communications have typically been held exempt have not communicated with the Government in their own interest or on behalf of any person or group whose interests might be affected by the Government action addressed by the consultant. In that regard, consultants may be enough like the agency's own personnel to justify calling their communications \"intra-agency.\" The Tribes, on the contrary, necessarily communicate with the Bureau with their own, albeit entirely legitimate, interests in mind. While this fact alone distinguishes tribal communications from the consultants' examples recognized by several Circuits, the distinction is even sharper, in that the Tribes are self-advocates at the expense of others seeking benefits inadequate to satisfy everyone. As to those documents bearing on the Plan, the Tribes are obviously in competition with nontribal claimants, including those irrigators represented by the respondent. While the documents at issue may not take the formally argumentative form of a brief, their function is quite apparently to support the tribal claims. The Court rejects the Department's assertion that the Klamath Tribe's consultant-like character is clearer in the circumstances of the Oregon adjudication, where the Department merely represents the interests of the Tribe before a state court that will make any decision about the respective rights of the contenders. Again, the dispositive point is that the apparent object of the Tribe's communications is a decision by a Government agency to support a claim by the Tribe that is necessarily adverse to the interests of competitors because there is not enough water to satisfy everyone. The position of the Tribe as Government beneficiary is a far cry from the position of the paid consultant. The Court also rejects the Department's argument that compelled release of the documents at issue would impair the Department's performance of its fiduciary obligation to protect the confidentiality of communications with tribes. This boils down to requesting that the Court read an \"Indian trust\" exemption into the statute. There is simply no support for that exemption in the statutory text, which must be read strictly to serve FOIA's mandate of broad disclosure. Pp. 8-14.~      189 F.3d 1034, affirmed.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT~      Souter, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      Documents in issue here, passing between Indian Tribes and the Department of the Interior, addressed tribal interests subject to state and federal proceedings to determine water allocations. The question is whether the documents are exempt from the disclosure requirements of the Freedom of Information Act, as \"intra-agency memorandums or letters\" that would normally be privileged in civil discovery. 5 U.S.C.  552(b)(5). We hold they are not.~    ~    ~      2~      * Two separate proceedings give rise to this case, the first a planning effort within the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation, and the second a state water rights adjudication in the Oregon courts. Within the Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) administers the Klamath Irrigation Project (Klamath Project or Project), which uses water from the Klamath River Basin to irrigate territory in Klamath County, Oregon, and two northern California counties. In 1995, the Department began work to develop a long-term operations plan for the Project, to be known as the Klamath Project Operation Plan (Plan), which would provide for allocation of water among competing uses and competing water users. The Department asked the Klamath as well as the Hoopa Valley, Karuk, and Yurok Tribes (Basin Tribes) to consult with Reclamation on the matter, and a memorandum of understanding between the Department and the Tribes recognized that \"[t]he United States Government has a unique legal relationship with Native American tribal governments,\" and called for \"[a]ssessment, in consultation with the Tribes, of the impacts of the [Plan] on Tribal trust resources.\" App. 59, 61.~    ~    ~      3~      During roughly the same period, the Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs (Bureau) filed claims on behalf of the Klamath Tribe alone in an Oregon state-court adjudication intended to allocate water rights. Since the Bureau is responsible for administering land and water held in trust for Indian tribes, 25 U.S.C.  1a; 25 CFR subch. H., pts. 150-181 (2000), it consulted with the Klamath Tribe, and the two exchanged written memorandums on the appropriate scope of the claims ultimately submitted by the United States for the benefit of the Klamath Tribe. The Bureau does not, however, act as counsel for the Tribe, which has its own lawyers and has independently submitted claims on its own behalf.1~    ~    ~      4~      Respondent, the Klamath Water Users Protective Association is a nonprofit association of water users in the Klamath River Basin, most of whom receive water from the Klamath Project, and whose interests are adverse to the tribal interests owing to scarcity of water. The Association filed a series of requests with the Bureau under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C.  552 seeking access to communications between the Bureau and the Basin Tribes during the relevant time period. The Bureau turned over several documents but withheld others as exempt under the attorney work-product and deliberative process privileges. These privileges are said to be incorporated in FOIA Exemption 5, which exempts from disclosure \"inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.\" 552(b)(5). The Association then sued the Bureau under FOIA to compel release of the documents.~    ~    ~      5~      By the time of the District Court ruling, seven documents remained in dispute, three of them addressing the Plan, three concerned with the Oregon adjudication, and the seventh relevant to both proceedings. See 189 F.3d 1034, 1036 (CA9 1999), App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a-49a. Six of the documents were prepared by the Klamath Tribe or its representative and were submitted at the Government's behest to the Bureau or to the Department's Regional Solicitor; a Bureau official prepared the seventh document and gave it to lawyers for the Klamath and Yurok Tribes. See Ibid.~    ~    ~      6~      The District Court granted the Government's motion for summary judgment. It held that each document qualified as an inter-agency or intra-agency communication for purposes of Exemption 5, and that each was covered by the deliberative process privilege or the attorney work product privilege, as having played a role in the Bureau's deliberations about the Plan or the Oregon adjudication. See 189 F.3d, at 1036, App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a-32a, 56a-65a.~    ~    ~      7~      The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. 189 F.3d 1034 (CA9 1999). It recognized that some Circuits had adopted a \"functional\" approach to Exemption 5, under which a document generated outside the Government might still qualify as an \"intra-agency\" communication. See id., at 1037-1038. The court saw no reason to go into that, however, for it ruled out any application of Exemption 5 on the ground that \"the Tribes with whom the Department has a consulting relationship have a direct interest in the subject matter of the consultations.\" Id., at 1038. The court said that \"[t]o hold otherwise would extend Exemption 5 to shield what amount to ex parte communications in contested proceedings between the Tribes and the Department.\" Ibid. Judge Hawkins dissented, for he saw the documents as springing \"from a relationship that remains consultative rather than adversarial, a relationship in which the Bureau and Department were seeking the expertise of the Tribes, rather than opposing them.\" Id., at 1045. He saw the proper enquiry as going not to a document's source, but to the role it plays in agency decisionmaking. See id., at 1039. We granted certiorari in view of the decision's significant impact on the relationship between Indian tribes and the Government, 530 U.S. 1304 (2000), and now affirm.~    ~    II~    ~      8~      Upon request, FOIA mandates disclosure of records held by a federal agency, see 5 U.S.C.  552 unless the documents fall within enumerated exemptions, see 552(b). \"[T]hese limited exemptions do not obscure the basic policy that disclosure, not secrecy, is the dominant objective of the Act,\" Department of Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352, 361 (1976); \"[c]onsistent with the Act's goal of broad disclosure, these exemptions have been consistently given a narrow compass,\" Department of Justice v. Tax Analysts, 492 U.S. 136, 151 (1989); see also FBI v. Abramson, 456 U.S. 615, 630 (1982) (\"FOIA exemptions are to be narrowly construed\").~    ~    ~      9~      * Exemption 5 protects from disclosure \"inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.\" 5 U.S.C.  552(b)(5). To qualify, a document must thus satisfy two conditions: its source must be a Government agency, and it must fall within the ambit of a privilege against discovery under judicial standards that would govern litigation against the agency that holds it.~    ~    ~      10~      Our prior cases on Exemption 5 have addressed the second condition, incorporating civil discovery privileges. See, e.g., United States v. Weber Aircraft Corp., 465 U.S. 792, 799-800 (1984); NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck  Co., 421 U.S. 132, 148 (1975) (\"Exemption 5 withholds from a member of the public documents which a private party could not discover in litigation with the agency\"). So far as they might matter here, those privileges include the privilege for attorney work-product and what is sometimes called the \"deliberative process\" privilege. Work product protects \"mental processes of the attorney,\" United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, 238 (1975), while deliberative process covers \"documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated,\" Sears, Roebuck  Co., 421 U.S., at 150 (internal quotation marks omitted). The deliberative process privilege rests on the obvious realization that officials will not communicate candidly among themselves if each remark is a potential item of discovery and front page news, and its object is to enhance \"the quality of agency decisions,\" id., at 151, by protecting open and frank discussion among those who make them within the Government, see EPA v. Mink, 410 U.S. 73, 86-87 (1973); see also Weber Aircraft Corp., supra, at 802.~    ~    ~      11~      The point is not to protect Government secrecy pure and simple, however, and the first condition of Exemption 5 is no less important than the second; the communication must be \"inter-agency or intra-agency.\" 5 U.S.C.  552(b)(5). Statutory definitions underscore the apparent plainness of this text. With exceptions not relevant here, \"agency\" means \"each authority of the Government of the United States,\" 551(1), and \"includes any executive department, military department, Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government . . . , or any independent regulatory agency,\" 552(f).~    ~    ~      12~      Although neither the terms of the exemption nor the statutory definitions say anything about communications with outsiders, some Courts of Appeals have held that in some circumstances a document prepared outside the Government may nevertheless qualify as an \"intra-agency\" memorandum under Exemption 5. See, e.g., Hoover v. Dept. of Interior, 611 F.2d 1132, 1137-1138 (CA5 1980); Lead Industries Assn. v. OSHA, 610 F.2d 70, 83 (CA2 1979); Soucie v. David, 448 F.2d 1067 (CADC 1971). In United States Department of Justice v. Julian, 486 U.S. 1 (1988), Justice Scalia, joined by Justices O'Connor and White, explained that \"the most natural meaning of the phrase 'intra-agency memorandum' is a memorandum that is addressed both to and from employees of a single agency,\" id., at 18, n. 1 (dissenting opinion). But his opinion also acknowledged the more expansive reading by some Courts of Appeals:~    ~    ~      13~      \"It is textually possible and ... in accord with the purpose of the provision, to regard as an intra-agency memorandum one that has been received by an agency, to assist it in the performance of its own functions, from a person acting in a governmentally conferred capacity other than on behalf of another agency-e.g., in a capacity as employee or consultant to the agency, or as employee or officer of another governmental unit (not an agency) that is authorized or required to provide advice to the agency.\" Ibid.2~    ~    ~      14~      Typically, courts taking the latter view have held that the exemption extends to communications between Government agencies and outside consultants hired by them. See, e.g., Hoover, supra, at 1138 (\"In determining value, the government may deem it necessary to seek the objective opinion of outside experts rather than rely solely on the opinions of government appraisers\"); Lead Industries Assn., supra, at 83 (applying Exemption 5 to cover draft reports \"prepared by outside consultants who had testified on behalf of the agency rather than agency staff\"); see also Government Land Bank v. GSA, 671 F.2d 663, 665 (CA5 1982) (\"Both parties agree that a property appraisal, performed under contract by an independent professional, is an 'intra-agency' document for purposes of the exemption\"). In such cases, the records submitted by outside consultants played essentially the same part in an agency's process of deliberation as documents prepared by agency personnel might have done. To be sure, the consultants in these cases were independent contractors and were not assumed to be subject to the degree of control that agency employment could have entailed; nor do we read the cases as necessarily assuming that an outside consultant must be devoid of a definite point of view when the agency contracts for its services. But the fact about the consultant that is constant in the typical cases is that the consultant does not represent an interest of its own, or the interest of any other client, when it advises the agency that hires it. Its only obligations are to truth and its sense of what good judgment calls for, and in those respects the consultant functions just as an employee would be expected to do.~    ~    B~    ~      15~      The Department purports to rely on this consultant corollary to Exemption 5 in arguing for its application to the Tribe's communications to the Bureau in its capacity of fiduciary for the benefit of the Indian Tribes. The existence of a trust obligation is not, of course, in question, see United States v. Cherokee Nation of Okla., 480 U.S. 700, 707 (1987); United States v. Mitchell, 463 U.S. 206, 225 (1983); Seminole Nation v. United States, 316 U.S. 286, 296-297 (1942). The fiduciary relationship has been described as \"one of the primary cornerstones of Indian law,\" F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 221 (1982), and has been compared to one existing under a common law trust, with the United States as trustee, the Indian tribes or individuals as beneficiaries, and the property and natural resources managed by the United States as the trust corpus. See, e.g., Mitchell, supra, at 225. Nor is there any doubt about the plausibility of the Government's assertion that the candor of tribal communications with the Bureau would be eroded without the protections of the deliberative process privilege recognized under Exemption 5. The Department is surely right in saying that confidentiality in communications with tribes is conducive to a proper discharge of its trust obligation.~    ~    ~      16~      From the recognition of this interest in frank communication, which the deliberative process privilege might protect, the Department would have us infer a sufficient justification for applying Exemption 5 to communications with the Tribes, in the same fashion that Courts of Appeals have found sufficient reason to favor a consultant's advice that way. But the Department's argument skips a necessary step, for it ignores the first condition of Exemption 5, that the communication be \"intra-agency or inter-agency.\" The Department seems to be saying that \"intra-agency\" is a purely conclusory term, just a label to be placed on any document the Government would find it valuable to keep confidential.~    ~    ~      17~      There is, however, no textual justification for draining the first condition of independent vitality, and once the intra-agency condition is applied,3 it rules out any application of Exemption 5 to tribal communications on analogy to consultants' reports (assuming, which we do not decide, that these reports may qualify as intra-agency under Exemption 5). As mentioned already, consultants whose communications have typically been held exempt have not been communicating with the Government in their own interest or on behalf of any person or group whose interests might be affected by the Government action addressed by the consultant. In that regard, consultants may be enough like the agency's own personnel to justify calling their communications \"intra-agency.\" The Tribes, on the contrary, necessarily communicate with the Bureau with their own, albeit entirely legitimate, interests in mind. While this fact alone distinguishes tribal communications from the consultants' examples recognized by several Courts of Appeals, the distinction is even sharper, in that the Tribes are self-advocates at the expense of others seeking benefits inadequate to satisfy everyone.4~    ~    ~      18~      As to those documents bearing on the Plan, the Tribes are obviously in competition with nontribal claimants, including those irrigators represented by the respondent. App. 66-71. The record shows that documents submitted by the Tribes included, among others, \"a position paper that discusses water law legal theories\" and \"addresses issues related to water rights of the tribes,\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 42a-43a, a memorandum \"contain[ing] views on policy the BIA could provide to other governmental agencies,\" \"views concerning trust resources,\" id., at 44a, and a letter \"conveying the views of the Klamath Tribes concerning issues involved in the water rights adjudication,\" id., at 47a. While these documents may not take the formally argumentative form of a brief, their function is quite apparently to support the tribal claims. The Tribes are thus urging a position necessarily adverse to the other claimants, the water being inadequate to satisfy the combined demand. As the Court of Appeals said, \"[t]he Tribes' demands, if satisfied, would lead to reduced water allocations to members of the Association and have been protested by Association members who fear water shortages and economic injury in dry years.\" 189 F.3d, at 1035.~    ~    ~      19~      The Department insists that the Klamath Tribe's consultant-like character is clearer in the circumstances of the Oregon adjudication, since the Department merely represents the interests of the Tribe before a state court that will make any decision about the respective rights of the contenders. Brief for Petitioners 42-45; Reply Brief for Petitioners 4-6. But it is not that simple. Even if there were no rival interests at stake in the Oregon litigation, the Klamath Tribe would be pressing its own view of its own interest in its communications with the Bureau. Nor could that interest be ignored as being merged somehow in the fiduciary interest of the Government trustee; the Bureau in its fiduciary capacity would be obliged to adopt the stance it believed to be in the beneficiary's best interest, not necessarily the position espoused by the beneficiary itself. Cf. Restatement (Second) of Trusts 176, Comment a (1957) (\"[I]t is the duty of the trustee to exercise such care and skill to preserve the trust property as a man of ordinary prudence would exercise in dealing with his own property . . .\").~    ~    ~      20~      But, again, the dispositive point is that the apparent object of the Tribe's communications is a decision by an agency of the Government to support a claim by the Tribe that is necessarily adverse to the interests of competitors. Since there is not enough water to satisfy everyone, the Government's position on behalf of the Tribe is potentially adverse to other users, and it might ask for more or less on behalf of the Tribe depending on how it evaluated the tribal claim compared with the claims of its rivals. The ultimately adversarial character of tribal submissions to the Bureau therefore seems the only fair inference, as confirmed by the Department's acknowledgement that its \"obligation to represent the Klamath Tribe necessarily coexists with the duty to protect other federal interests, including in particular its interests with respect to the Klamath Project.\" Reply Brief 8; cf. Nevada v. United States, 463 U.S. 110, 142 (1983) (\"[W]here Congress has imposed upon the United States, in addition to its duty to represent Indian tribes, a duty to obtain water rights for reclamation projects, and has even authorized the inclusion of reservation lands within a project, the analogy of a faithless private fiduciary cannot be controlling for purposes of evaluating the authority of the United States to represent different interests\"). The position of the Tribe as beneficiary is thus a far cry from the position of the paid consultant.~    ~    ~      21~      Quite apart from its attempt to draw a direct analogy between tribes and conventional consultants, the Department argues that compelled release of the documents would itself impair the Department's performance of a specific fiduciary obligation to protect the confidentiality of communications with tribes.5 Because, the Department argues, traditional fiduciary standards forbid a trustee to disclose information acquired as a trustee when it should know that disclosure would be against the beneficiary's interests, excluding the Tribes' submissions to the Department from Exemption 5 would handicap the Department in doing what the law requires. Brief for Petitioners 36-37.6 And in much the same vein, the Department presses the argument that \"FOIA is intended to cast light on existing government practices; it should not be interpreted and applied so as to compel federal agencies to perform their assigned substantive functions in other than the normal manner.\" Id., at 29.~    ~    ~      22~      All of this boils down to requesting that we read an \"Indian trust\" exemption into the statute, a reading that is out of the question for reasons already explored. There is simply no support for the exemption in the statutory text, which we have elsewhere insisted be read strictly in order to serve FOIA's mandate of broad disclosure,7 which was obviously expected and intended to affect Government operations. In FOIA, after all, a new conception of Government conduct was enacted into law, \" 'a general philosophy of full agency disclosure.' \" Department of Justice v. Tax Analysts, 492 U.S., at 142 (quoting S. Rep. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., at 3 (1965)). \"Congress believed that this philosophy, put into practice, would help 'ensure an informed citizenry, vital to the functioning of a democratic society.' \" Ibid.

Brief for Respondent 7.~      ~      ~        2~         The majority in Julian did not address the question whether the documents at issue were \"inter-agency or intra-agency\" records within the meaning of Exemption 5, because it concluded that the documents would be routinely discoverable in civil litigation and therefore would not be covered by Exemption 5 in any event. 486 U.S., at 11-14.~      ~      ~        3~         Because we conclude that the documents do not meet this threshold condition, we need not reach step two of the Exemption 5 analysis and enquire whether the communications would normally be discoverable in civil litigation. See United States v. Weber Aircraft Corp., 465 U.S. 792, 799 (1984).~      ~      ~        4~         Courts of Appeals have recognized at least two instances of intra-agency consultants that arguably extend beyond what we have characterized as the typical examples. In Public Citizen, Inc. v. Department of Justice, 111 F.3d 168 (CADC 1997), former Presidents were so treated in their communications with the National Archives and Records Administration, even though the Presidents had their own, independent interests, id., at 171. And in Ryan v. Department of Justice, 617 F.2d 781 (CADC 1980), Senators' responses to the Attorney General's questionnaires about the judicial nomination process were held exempt, even though we would expect a Senator to have strong personal views on the matter. We need not decide whether either instance should be recognized as intra-agency, even if communications with paid consultants are ultimately so treated. As explained above, the intra-agency condition excludes, at the least, communications to or from an interested party seeking a Government benefit at the expense of other applicants.~      ~      ~        5~         The Department points out that the Plan-related documents submitted by the Tribes were furnished to the Bureau rather than to Reclamation, a fact which the Department claims reinforces the conclusion that the documents were provided to the Department in its capacity as trustee. Brief for Petitioners 47. This fact does not alter our analysis, however, because we think that even communications made in support of the trust relationship fail to fit comfortably within the statutory text.~      ~      ~        6~         We note that the Department cites the Restatement for the proposition that a \" 'trustee is under a duty to the beneficiary not to disclose to a third person information which he has acquired as trustee where he should know that the effect of such disclosure would be detrimental to the interest of the beneficiary.' \" Brief for Petitioner 36 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Trusts  170, Comment s (1957)). It is unnecessary for us to decide if the Department's duties with respect to its communications with Indian tribes fit this pattern.~      ~      ~        7~         The Department does not attempt to argue that Congress specifically envisioned that Exemption 5 would cover communications pursuant to the Indian trust responsibility, or any other trust responsibility. Although as a general rule we are hesitant to construe statutes in light of legislative inaction, see Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461 U.S. 574, 600 (1983), we note that Congress has twice considered specific proposals to protect Indian trust information, see Indian Amendment to Freedom of Information Act: Hearings on S. 2652 before the Subcommittee on Indian Affairs of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. (1976); Indian Trust Information Protection Act of 1978, S. 2773, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. (1978). We do so because these proposals confirm the commonsense reading that we give Exemption 5 today, as well as to emphasize that nobody in the Federal Government should be surprised by this reading.~      ~    ~    ",

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE, PETITIONERv.MARIA A. GREGORY~    No. 00-758.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued October 9, 2001Decided November 13, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      While three disciplinary actions that petitioner Postal Service took against respondent were pending in grievance proceedings pursuant to the Postal Service's collective bargaining agreement with respondent's union, the Postal Service terminated respondent's employment after a fourth violation.  The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) permits covered employees, such as respondent, to appeal removals and other serious disciplinary actions to the Merit Systems Protection Board (Board) or through the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both.  Respondent appealed to the Board, where an agency must prove its charge by a preponderance of the evidence, 5 U.S.C.  7701 (c)(1)(B), proving not only that the misconduct occurred, but also that the penalty assessed is reasonable in relation to it.  An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) concluded that respondent's termination was reasonable in light of her four violations.  Although the three prior disciplinary actions were the subject of pending grievances, the ALJ analyzed them independently, under the approach set forth in Bolling v. Department of Air Force, 8 M. S. P. B. 658, and found that they were not clearly erroneous.  While respondent's petition for review of the ALJ's decision was pending before the Board, an arbitrator overturned the first disciplinary action.  Respondent did not inform the Board, which denied her petition.  The Federal Circuit vacated in part and remanded, holding that prior disciplinary actions subject to ongoing proceedings may not be used to support a penalty's reasonableness.~      Held:~      1. The Board may review independently prior disciplinary actions pending in grievance proceedings when reviewing termination and other serious disciplinary actions.  The Federal Circuit reviews a Board decision's substance under the extremely narrow arbitrary and capricious standard, which allows the Board wide latitude in fulfilling its obligation to review agency disciplinary actions.  The role of judicial review is only to ascertain if the Board has met the CSRA's minimum standards.  There is nothing arbitrary about the Board's decision to independently review prior violations.  Neither the Federal Circuit nor respondent has suggested that the Board has applied its policy inconsistently or that it lacks reasons for its approach.  Nor is independent Board review contrary to any law.  The Federal Circuit's reference to Douglas v. Veterans Admin., 5 M. S. P. B. 313, which sets out the framework for reviewing disciplinary actions, is a way of describing the Board's review process, not, as respondent suggests, an indication that the Board violated 7701(c)(1)(B).  More important, any suggestion that independent review by the Board violates that section's preponderance of the evidence standard would be incorrect.  The Board has its own mechanism for allowing agencies to meet their statutory burden of justifying all violations supporting a penalty.  Insofar as Bolling review is adequate, an agency may meet its burden by prevailing either in grievance or before the Board.  Independent review also does not violate the CSRA's general statutory scheme, which allows Board review of serious, but not minor, disciplinary actions.  Where a termination is based on a series of disciplinary actions, some of which are minor, the Board's authority to review the termination must also include the authority to review each of the prior disciplinary actions to establish the penalty's reasonableness.  Any effects of such review on pending grievance procedures result from the CSRA's parallel review structures.  If the Board's independent review procedure is adequate, the review that an employee receives is fair.  Although that procedure's fairness is not before this Court, a presumption of regularity attaches to government agencies' actions, and some deference to agency disciplinary actions is appropriate.  Pp. 48.~      2. Because the Board does not rely upon disciplinary actions that were overturned in grievance proceedings at the time of its review, a remand to the Federal Circuit is necessary to determine the effect that the reversal of one of respondent's disciplinary actions had on her termination.  Pp. 89.212 F.3d 1296, vacated and remanded.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OFAPPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT~      O'Connor, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and Stevens, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, and Breyer, JJ., joined.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 allows eligible employees to appeal termination and other serious disciplinary actions to the Merit Systems Protection Board.  5 U.S.C.  7512 -7513.  The Federal Circuit ruled that, when assessing the reasonableness of these actions, the Board may not consider prior disciplinary actions that are pending in collectively bargained grievance proceedings.  212 F.3d 1296, 1298 (2000).  Because the Board has broad discretion in determining how to review prior disciplinary actions and need not adopt the Federal Circuit's rule, we now vacate and remand for further proceedings.~    ~    ~      2~      * Respondent Maria Gregory worked for petitioner United States Postal Service as a letter technician with responsibility for overseeing letter carriers on five mail routes, and serving as a replacement carrier on those routes.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A15.  On April 7, 1997, respondent left work early to take her daughter to the doctor, ignoring her supervisor's instructions to sort the mail for her route before leaving.  She received a letter of warning for insubordination.  App. 47-48.  Respondent filed a grievance under the procedure established in the collective bargaining agreement between her union and her employer, see generally 1998-2001 Agreement Between National Association of Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO and U.S. Postal Service, Art. 15.  App. 43.~    ~    ~      3~      Later that same month respondent was cited for delaying the mail, after mail from another route was found in her truck at the end of the day.  Id., at 45-46.  The Postal Service suspended her for seven days, and respondent filed a second grievance.  Id., at 41-42.  In August 1997, respondent was again disciplined for various violations, including failing to deliver certified mail and attempting to receive unauthorized or unnecessary overtime.  Id., at 38-40.  She received a 14-day suspension, and again filed a grievance.~    ~    ~      4~      While these three disciplinary actions were pending in grievance proceedings pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement, respondent was disciplined one final time.  On September 13, 1997, respondent filed a form requesting assistance in completing her route or, alternatively, 3 hours of overtime.  Considering this request excessive, respondent's supervisor accompanied her on her route and determined that she had overestimated the necessary overtime by more than an hour.  Id., at 31-33.  In light of this violation and respondent's previous violations, her supervisor recommended that she be removed from her employment at the Postal Service.  Ibid.  On November 17, 1997, the Postal Service ordered respondent's termination effective nine days later.  Id., at  24-29.~    ~    ~      5~      Because respondent previously served in the Army, she falls into the category of \"preference eligible\" Postal Service employees covered by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA).  5 U.S.C.  7511 (a)(1)(B)(ii).  The CSRA provides covered employees the opportunity to appeal removals and other serious disciplinary actions to the Merit Systems Protection Board (the Board).  7512-7513.  Under the CSRA, respondent could appeal her termination to the Board or seek relief through the negotiated grievance procedure, but could not do both.  7121(e)(1).  Respondent chose to appeal to the Board.~    ~    ~      6~      When an employing agency's disciplinary action is challenged before the Board, the agency bears the burden of proving its charge by a preponderance of the evidence.  7701(c)(1)(B).  Under the Board's settled procedures, this requires proving not only that the misconduct actually occurred, but also that the penalty assessed was reasonable in relation to it.  Douglas v. Veterans Admin., 5 M. S. P. B. 313, 333-334 (1981).~    ~    ~      7~      Following these guidelines, a Board Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) upheld respondent's termination, concluding that the Postal Service had shown that respondent overestimated her overtime beyond permissible limits on September 13, App. to Pet. for Cert. A-29, and that her termination was reasonable in light of this violation and her prior violations.  Id., at A-36 to A-40.  Although the three prior disciplinary actions were the subject of pending grievances, the ALJ analyzed them independently, following the approach set forth in Bolling v. Department of Air Force, 8 M. S. P. B. 658 (1981).  Bolling provides for de novo review of prior disciplinary actions unless: \"(1) [the employee] was informed of the action in writing; (2) the action is a matter of record; and (3) [the employee] was given the opportunity to dispute the charges to a higher level than the authority that imposed the discipline.\" Id., at 660-661.  If these conditions are met, Board review of prior disciplinary action is limited to determining whether the action is clearly erroneous.  Id., at 660.  After finding that respondent's three prior disciplinary actions met Bolling's three conditions, the ALJ concluded that there was no clear evidence of error.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A-37.~    ~    ~      8~      Respondent petitioned the Board for review of the ALJ's decision.  While this appeal was pending, an arbitrator resolved respondent's first grievance (relating to the April 7 incident) in her favor, and ordered that the letter of warning be expunged.  App. 3-16.  Respondent did not advise the Board of that ruling.  The Board then denied her request for review of the ALJ's determination.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A-9 to A-10.~    ~    ~      9~      Respondent petitioned for review of the Board's decision in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  5 U.S.C.  7703 (a).  That court affirmed the Board's decision to uphold the ALJ's factual findings with respect to the September 13 incident.  212 F.3d, at 1299.  Taking judicial notice of the fact that one of the three disciplinary actions underlying respondent's termination had been overturned in arbitration, and noting that respondent's two remaining grievances were still pending, it reversed the Board's determination that the penalty was reasonable.  Ibid.  While recognizing that disciplinary history is an \"important factor\" in assessing any penalty, id., at 1300, the Federal Circuit held that \"prior disciplinary actions that are subject to ongoing proceedings may not be used to support\" a penalty's reasonableness.  Id., at 1298.  It therefore vacated the Board's decision in part and remanded for further proceedings. Id., at 1300.  We granted certiorari, 531 U.S. 1143 (2001).~    ~    II~    ~      10~      The Federal Circuit's statutory review of the substance of Board decisions is limited to determining whether they are unsupported by substantial evidence or are \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\"  5 U.S.C.  7703 (c).  Like its counterpart in the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.  706 (2), the arbitrary and capricious standard is extremely narrow, Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402 , 416 (1971), and allows the Board wide latitude in fulfilling its obligation to review agency disciplinary actions.  It is not for the Federal Circuit to substitute its own judgment for that of the Board.  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29 , 43 (1983).  The role of judicial review is only to ascertain if the Board has met the minimum standards set forth in the statute.  We conclude that the Board need not adopt the Federal Circuit's rule in order to meet these standards.~    ~    ~      11~      The Postal Service argues that the Board's independent review of prior disciplinary actions is sufficient to meet its statutory obligations.  The adequacy of the Board's particular review mechanism Bolling review, see Bolling v. Department of Air Force, supra is not before us.  The Federal Circuit said nothing about Bolling, instead adopting a sweeping rule that the Board may never rely on prior disciplinary actions subject to ongoing grievance procedures, regardless of the sort of independent review the Board provides.  Respondent likewise asks this Court only to uphold the Federal Circuit's rule forbidding independent Board review.  She does not seek a ruling requiring a different Board review mechanism, nor did she do so before the Federal Circuit.  Her brief in that court neither mentioned Bolling nor its standard, arguing only that the Board should hold off its review altogether pending the outcome of collectively-bargained grievance proceedings.  Brief for Petitioner in No. 00-3123 (CA Fed.), p. 2.  Moreover, even if the adequacy of Bolling review were before us, we lack sufficient briefing on its specific functioning in this case.  We thus consider only whether the Board may permissibly review prior disciplinary actions subject to ongoing grievance procedures independently, not whether the particular way in which it does so meets the statutory standard.~    ~    ~      12~      There is certainly nothing arbitrary about the Board's decision to independently review prior disciplinary violations.  Neither the Federal Circuit nor respondent has suggested that the Board has applied this policy inconsistently indeed, the Board has taken this same approach for 19 years.  See Carr v. Department of Air Force, 9 M. S. P. B. 714 (1982).  Nor have they argued that the Board lacks reasons for its approach.  Following the Federal Circuit's rule would require the Board either to wait until challenges to disciplinary actions pending in grievance proceedings are completed before rendering its decision, or to ignore altogether the violations being challenged in grievance in determining the reasonableness of the penalty.  The former may cause undue delay. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 6-7. The latter would, in many cases, effectively preclude agencies from relying on an employee's disciplinary history, which the Federal Circuit itself acknowledged to be an \"important factor\" in any disciplinary decision.  212 F.3d, at 1300.~    ~    ~      13~      Nor is independent review by the Board contrary to any law.  The Federal Circuit cited no provision of the CSRA or any other statute to justify its new rule.  Id., at 1299-1300.  At oral argument in this Court, respondent'scounsel pointed to the Federal Circuit's statement that, if pending grievances were later overturned in arbitration, \"the foundation of the Board's Douglas analysis would be compromised.\" Id., at 1300 (citing Douglas v. Veterans Admin., 5 M. S. P. B. 313 (1981)).  The Board's Douglas decision set out a general framework for reviewing agency disciplinary actions.  Because Douglas at one point specifically discussed 5 U.S.C.  7701 (c)(1)(B), the CSRA provision placing the burden of proof on the employing agency to justify its disciplinary action, counsel claimed, the Federal Circuit must have thought the Board's policy violates that section.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 49.  We do not read the Federal Circuit's citation of Douglas as an implicit reference to 7701(c)(1)(B), particularly given that the Federal Circuit's opinion nowhere mentions that section's standard.  Rather, we interpret the Federal Circuit's reference to Douglas as a way of describing the entire process of Board review of disciplinary actions.~    ~    ~      14~      More important, any suggestion that the Board's decision to independently review prior disciplinary actions violates 7701(c)(1)(B)'s preponderance of the evidence standard would be incorrect.  To the extent that that standard places the burden upon employing agencies to justify all of the violations including those dealt with in prior disciplinary actions that are the basis for the penalty, the Board has its own mechanism for allowing agencies to meet that burden.  Insofar as Bolling review is adequate to meet this burden of proof, an employing agency may meet its statutory burden to justify prior actions by prevailing either in grievance or before the Board.~    ~    ~      15~      Amicus National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) argues that independent Board review of prior disciplinary actions pending in grievance violates the CSRA's general statutory scheme.  Brief for National Treasury Employees Union as Amicus Curiae 8-12.  Employees covered by the CSRA may elect Board review only for disciplinary actions of a certain seriousness, such as termination, suspension for more than 14 days, or a reduction in grade or pay.  5 U.S.C.  7512 -7513.  For more minor actions, workers may only seek review through negotiated grievance procedures, if they exist.  7121.  According to NTEU, this scheme deprives the Board of the statutory authority to review minor disciplinary actions like the three that were pending in this case.  It is true that the CSRA contemplates that at least some eligible employees (those represented by unions) will have two different forums for challenging disciplinary actions, depending in part on their seriousness.  If the Board had attempted to review respondent's first disciplinary action before she was terminated, it would have exceeded its statutory authority.  In this case, however, the Board was asked to review respondent's termination, something it clearly has authority to do.  7512-7513.  Because this termination was based on a series of disciplinary actions, some of which are minor, the Board's authority to review the termination must also include the authority to review each of the prior disciplinary actions to establish the reasonableness of the penalty as a whole.~    ~    ~      16~      Independent Board review of disciplinary actions pending in grievance proceedings may at times result in the Board reaching a different conclusion than the arbitrator.  It may also result in a terminated employee never reaching a resolution of her grievance at all, because some collective bargaining agreements require unions to withdraw grievances when an employee's termination becomes final before the Board.  Brief for Respondent 10-11, 37; Reply Brief for Petitioner 14.  Rather than being inconsistent with the statutory scheme, however, these possibilities are the result of the parallel structures of review set forth in the CSRA.~    ~    ~      17~      Such results are not necessarily unfair.  Any employee who appeals a disciplinary action to the Board receives independent Board review.  If the Board's mechanism for reviewing prior disciplinary actions is itself adequate, the review such an employee receives is fair.  Although the fairness of the Board's own procedure is not before us, we note that a presumption of regularity attaches to the actions of government agencies, United States v. Chemical Foundation, Inc., 272 U.S. 1 , 14-15 (1926), and that some deference to agency disciplinary actions is appropriate.~    ~    III~    ~      18~      Although the Board independently reviews prior disciplinary actions pending in grievance, it also has a policy of not relying upon disciplinary actions that have already been overturned in grievance proceedings at the time of Board review.  See Jones v. Department of Air Force, 24 M. S. P. R. 429, 431 (1984).  As one of respondent's disciplinary actions was overturned in arbitration before the Board rendered its decision, the Postal Service concedes that a remand to the Federal Circuit is necessary to determine the effect of this reversal on respondent's termination.  Reply Brief for Petitioner 15-16.~    ~    ~      19~      The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is therefore vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      20~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      21~      Thomas, J., filed a concurring opinion.~    ~    ~      22~      Ginsburg, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.~    ~    ~      23~      Justice Thomas, concurring.~    ~    ~      24~      While I join the Court's opinion as far as it goes, it does not go far enough.  The Court concludes that the adequacy of the mechanism the Merit Systems Protection Board used to review prior disciplinary actions pending in collectively bargained grievance proceedings (the so-called Bolling framework) is a question \"not before us.\"  Ante, at 5.  I think it is.~    ~    ~      25~      The Federal Circuit below held that the Board, in assessing the reasonableness of petitioner's decision to terminate respondent, abused its discretion by relying upon prior disciplinary actions that were pending in collectively bargained grievance proceedings.  212 F.3d 1296, 1300 (2000).~    ~    ~      26~      Petitioner now contests the Federal Circuit's holding by arguing that the Board's consideration of prior disciplinary actions subject to pending grievances does not constitute an abuse of discretion because the Board's use of the Bolling framework, see Bolling v. Department of Air Force, 8 M. S. P. B. 658 (1981), provides employees with more than adequate procedural safeguards.1  Brief for Petitioner 27--28.  Respondent, by contrast, counters that the Bolling framework not only is insufficient to prevent the \"unfairness\" inherent in the Board's consideration of prior disciplinary actions subject to pending grievances, but also is inconsistent with the agency's statutory burden to show that its decision is supported by a \"preponderance of the evidence.\"  See Brief for Respondent 34-37.  Properly disposing of this case requires that we address these arguments.2~    ~    ~      27~      This is not a difficult task because the Bolling framework provides federal employees with more than adequate procedural safeguards.  Title 5 U.S.C.  7503 (b), for instance, sets forth the basic procedural protections to which employees receiving minor discipline are entitled pursuant to the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA).3  Conspicuously absent from the statutory provision is any opportunity to appeal a minor disciplinary action to the Board.  Thus, as petitioner points out, \"it can hardly be said that the Bolling framework for collateral review of prior discipline conflicts with the CSRA, when Congress chose not to provide for any [Board] review of minor disciplinary actions.\"  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 12-13~    ~    ~      28~      (emphasis in original).~    ~    ~      29~      Respondent's argument that the Bolling framework conflicts with the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard set forth in 5 U.S.C.  7701 (c)(1)(B) is also unavailing.  The logical consequence of respondent's position is that the Board would be required to review de novo all facts supporting all prior disciplinary actions relied upon by an agency to justify the reasonableness of a penalty, whether or not the prior actions were ever grieved.4  Nothing in the CSRA supports this rather remarkable proposition.  At most, the statute requires an agency to prove the existence of prior disciplinary actions; it does not place the burden on the agency to prove the facts underlying those actions.~    ~    ~      30~      The central flaw in the Federal Circuit's decision is that it relies on the mistaken assumption that the Board's review process and collectively bargained grievance proceedings are somehow linked.  212 F.3d, at 1300.  This assumption is not supported by the CSRA.  Under the statute, the Board's review process and collectively bargained grievance procedures constitute entirely separate structures.  As a result, the Board need not wait for an employee's pending grievances to be resolved before taking account of prior disciplinary actions in its assessment of the reasonableness of a penalty given in a subsequent disciplinary action.5~    ~    ~      31~      For these reasons, I agree with the Court's decision to vacate the judgment of the Federal Circuit and remand for further proceedings.6~    ~    ~      ~        Notes~      ~      ~        1~          Petitioner's argument is certainly quite relevant here as the Board Administrative Law Judge below considered prior disciplinary actions in respondent's case pursuant to the Bolling framework.  See ante, at 3; App. to Pet. for Cert. A-36 to A-37.~      ~      ~        2~          The Court accurately notes that respondent's brief in the Federal Circuit merely argued that the Board erred by relying upon prior disciplinary actions and nowhere mentioned the Bolling framework.  See ante, at 5.  Petitioner, however, has put the Bolling framework squarely into play by relying upon it to support its contention that the Board's practice of considering prior disciplinary actions is not an abuse of discretion.  Given that petitioner, in defending the Board's practice, raises the Bolling framework for the first time in this Court, respondent surely has not waived her right to argue that the protections provided by the Bolling framework are inadequate to save the practice invalidated by the Federal Circuit.~      ~      ~        3~          This statutory provision applies to suspensions for 14 days or less.  5 U.S.C.  7503 (a).  Respondent's prior disciplinary actions pending in grievance proceedings fall into this category.~      ~      ~        4~          Justice Ginsburg's suggestion to the contrary, see post, at 3, n. 2 (opinion concurring in judgment), rests on the assumption that the Board's review process and collectively bargained grievance proceedings are somehow linked.  As explained infra, such an assumption is erroneous.  Title 5 U.S.C.  7701 (c)(1)(B) either requires an agency to prove by a preponderance of the evidence all facts supporting all prior disciplinary actions relied upon by an agency or it does not.  Whether an employee has chosen to access collectively bargained grievance proceedings with respect to a prior disciplinary action is irrelevant to answering this question.  Indeed, Justice Ginsburg's reasoning still suggests that the Board must review de novo all facts supporting all prior minor disciplinary actions relied upon by agencies in cases where employees are not represented by a union as such employees have no ability to access collectively bargained grievance proceedings.  Such a requirement, however, is nowhere to be found in the CSRA.~      ~      ~        5~          Neither would it be, as Justice Ginsburg intimates, \"arbitrary and capricious\" for the Board to disregard an arbitrator's reversal of a prior disciplinary action.  Post, at 2 (opinion concurring in judgment).  Such an argument, like the Federal Circuit's holding below, rests on the erroneous premise that the CSRA inextricably ties together the Board's review process and collectively bargained grievance proceedings.  To be sure, the Board has chosen to link its review to collectively bargained grievance proceedings at least to some extent by adopting a policy of not relying upon disciplinary actions that have been reversed through grievance proceedings.  Cf. Jones v. Department of Air Force, 24 MSPR 429, 430-431 (1984).  But the Board is not required to do so.  Neither Justice Ginsburg nor the Federal Circuit cites any statutory provision mandating that the Board must take this step.  The CSRA simply establishes no link between the Board's review process, which is designed to protect an employee's statutory rights, and grievance proceedings, which adjudicate rights secured through collective bargaining agreements.  As the Court points out: \"Independent Board review of disciplinary actions . . . may at times result in the Board reaching a different conclusion than the arbitrator.\"  Ante, at 8.~      ~      ~        6~          Given the Board's stated policy of not relying upon disciplinary actions that have already been overturned in grievance proceedings at the time of Board review, see n. 5, supra, I agree that a remand is necessary for the Federal Circuit to consider the relevance of the fact that one of respondent's prior disciplinary actions had already been reversed when the Board finalized its review of her case.~      ~    ~    ~      32~      Justice Ginsburg, concurring in the judgment.~    ~    ~      33~      Although I join the Court's judgment, I do so on grounds not stated in the Court's opinion.  I note first that under Bolling v. Department of Air Force, the Board's review of prior disciplinary actions pending in negotiated grievance proceedings requires, in cases like this one, only that the Board determine whether an agency action was \"clearly erroneous.\"  8 M. S. P. B. 658, 660 (1981).  This summary and highly deferential standard is arguably inconsistent with the statutory requirement that the Board sustain a decision of an agency \"only if   [it] is supported by a preponderance of the evidence.\"  5 U.S.C.  7701 (c)(1)(B).  The Court maintains that the adequacy of Bolling review to meet 7701(c)(1)(B)'s preponderance of the evidence standard is a question \"not before us.\"  Ante, at 5, 8.  In light of the unsettled issue, however, I would place no reliance upon the Board's \"independent review\" of prior discipline, see ante, at 5, 6, in this case.  Nevertheless, I do not resist the Court's remand order for the reasons set out below.~    ~    ~      34~      MSPB regulations allow the Board to reopen an appeal and reconsider its decision \"at any time.\"  5 CFR  1201.118 (2001) (\"The Board may reopen an appeal and reconsider a decision of [an administrative judge] on its own motion at any time, regardless of any other provisions of this part.\").  There is every reason to believe that the Board would reopen to reconsider a decision that credited a prior disciplinary action later overturned in arbitration.  See Jones v. Department of Air Force, 24 MSPR 429, 431 (1984) (suspension \"reversed by grievance   was effectively cancelled and thus should not be considered in determining a reasonable penalty for the current charge\").1  Notably, the Postal Service agrees that the Board may invoke its provision for reopening \"in the event that the employee's prior disciplinary record has been revised as the result of a successful grievance.\"  Brief for Petitioner 28; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 22 (counsel for the Postal Service confirmed Service's recognition that \"the [B]oard's regulations permit the [B]oard to reopen any case at any time to reconsider it in light of a grievance which may have proved successful\").~    ~    ~      35~      Indeed, it might well be \"arbitrary and capricious\" in such a situation for the Board to disregard the employee's revised record and refuse to reopen.  Cf. 18 C. Wright, A. Miller,  E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure 4433, p. 311 (1981) (a \"judgment based upon the preclusive effects of [a prior] judgment should not stand if the [prior] judgment is reversed\"); id., at 312-315; Restatement (Second) of Judgments 16 and Comment c (1980) (nullification of an earlier judgment on which a subsequent judgment relied \"may be made the ground for appropriate proceedings for relief from the later judgment with any suitable provision for restitution of benefits that may have been obtained under that judgment\"); id., 84 (generally, \"a valid and final award by arbitration has the same effects under the rules of res judicata, subject to the same exceptions and qualifications, as a judgment of a court\").2~    ~    ~      36~      Gregory did not bring to the Board's attention her successful grievance of the Postal Service's first disciplinary action, i.e., a letter of warning dated May 13, 1997, based on the April 7, 1997, incident, see ante, at 1-2; App. 43, 47-48.  Under the MSPB's regulations, she may even now ask the Board to reopen based on the expungement of that action, or the Board may reopen \"on its own motion.\"  5 CFR  1201.118 (2001); see Tr. of Oral Arg. 26 (counsel for the Postal Service acknowledged that successful grievance of first disciplinary action \"could have been brought to the attention of the [B]oard and still could be today\").  Gregory may also bring to the Board's attention any revision resulting from successful grievances of the Postal Service's second and third disciplinary actions, i.e., the seven-day suspension ordered on June 7, 1997, see ante, at 2; App. 41-42, 45-46, and the fourteen-day suspension ordered on August 7, 1997, see ante, at 2; App. 38-40.~    ~    ~      37~      Gregory asserts that the Postal Service resists arbitration of her second and third grievances on the ground that under the collective-bargaining agreement between the Postal Service and her union, predischarge grievances do not survive a discharge which has been made final.  Brief for Respondent 10-12, and n. 5, 26-27.  She does not suggest, however, that the union is disarmed from bargaining for postdischarge continuation of grievances through to completion of arbitration.3~    ~    ~      38~      Gregory, moreover, elected to resort to the MSPB \"[a]t the advice of her then-counsel.\"  Id., at 9.  She could have asked her union to challenge her dismissal before an arbitrator.4  Had she and her union opted for arbitration rather than MSPB review of the dismissal, she might have fared better; it appears that a labor arbitrator, in determining the reasonableness of a penalty, would have accorded no weight to prior discipline grieved but not yet resolved by a completed arbitration.  See Arbitration Between National Assn. of Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO, and USPS, Case No. E94 N-4E-D 96075418, pp. 16-18 (Apr. 19, 1999) (Snow, Arb.), Lodging of Respondent 57-59 (referring to parties' \"past practice of giving unresolved grievances no standing in removal hearings,\" arbitrator granted a continuance \"pending resolution of an underlying disciplinary grievance\"); Arbitration Between USPS and National Assn. of Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO, Case No. D90 N-4D-D 95076768, pp. 19-21 (Mar. 20, 1996) (Sickles, Arb.), Lodging of Respondent 27-29 (although employing agency need not await resolution of prior grievances before ordering an employee's removal, an arbitrator may not take account of prior discipline until the appeals process has yielded a final resolution); Arbitration Between USPS and National Post Office Mail Handlers, Case No. MC-S-0874-D, p. 7 (June 18, 1977) (Fasser, Arb.), Lodging of Respondent 7 (\"Until th[e] appeal [of a prior disciplinary action] is finally adjudicated, it has no standing in this proceeding.\").  Gregory, having at her own option forgone arbitration proceedings, in which prior discipline could not weigh against her while grievances were underway, is not comfortably situated to complain that the procedure she elected employed a different rule.~    ~    ~      39~      Given (1) the Board's reopening regulation, (2) the alternative arbitration forum Gregory might have pursued, (3) the Court's explicit reservation of the question of \"the adequacy of Bolling review,\" ante, at 5, 8, and (4) the apparent, incorrect view of the Federal Circuit that the Postal Service itself could not take account of prior disciplinary action that is the subject of a pending grievance proceeding, see 212 F.3d 1296, 1299, 1300 (2000),5 I agree that a remand is in order.~    ~    ~      ~        Notes~      ~      ~        1~          The Board thus comprehends the two schemes its own review, and arbitration under the bargained-for grievance procedure as harmonious and not, as Justice Thomas does, ante, at 3-4 (concurring opinion), as entirely unrelated to each other.~      ~      ~        2~          Justice Thomas suggests, ante, at 3 (concurring opinion), that Gregory's argument would logically require the Board to review de novo any prior disciplinary action upon which the employer relied in removing an employee, \"whether or not the prior actions were ever grieved.\"  Failure to pursue an available grievance procedure or other avenue of appeal, however, would end the matter.  It is well settled that one who fails timely to appeal an adverse decision is bound by that decision in later proceedings.  See, e.g., New Haven Inclusion Cases, 399 U.S. 392 , 481 (1970) (holding that a party who \"took no appeal\" from an adverse order is \"foreclosed by res judicata\" from later seeking relief inconsistent with that order); see also 18 Wright, Miller  Cooper, supra, 4433, at 305 (\"preclusion cannot be defeated by electing to fo[r]go an available opportunity to appeal\"); id., at 305-308; Restatement (Second) of Judgments 83 and Comment a, 84 and Comment e (in general, administrative adjudications and arbitration awards have the same preclusive effects as court judgments).~      ~      ~        3~          At oral argument counsel for the Postal Service sought to \"make clear\" that \"if this Court reverses the decision [of the Federal Circuit],\" the Service \"would not object to the continuance of [a] grievance.\"  Tr. of Oral Arg. 55.~      ~      ~        4~          Grievances \"may be appealed to   arbitration\" only \"by the certified representative of the Union.\"  1998-2001 Agreement Between National Association of Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO and U.S. Postal Service, Art. 15, 4(A)(2).~      ~      ~        5~          The petition for certiorari and the brief for petitioner state the question presented as follows: \"Whether a federal agency, when disciplining or removing an employee for misconduct pursuant to the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, 5 U.S.C.  1101 et seq., may take account of prior disciplinary actions that are the subject of pending grievance proceedings.\"  Pet. for Cert.

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.TRW INC., PETITIONERv.ADELAIDE ANDREWS~    No. 00-1045.~    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES~    Argued October 9, 2001Decided November 13, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA or Act) requires credit reporting agencies, inter alia, to maintain \"reasonable procedures\" to avoid improper disclosures of consumer credit information.  15 U.S.C.  1681e (a).  The Act's limitations provision prescribes that an action to enforce any liability created under the Act must be brought \"within two years from the date on which the liability arises, except that where a defendant has   willfully misrepresented any information required under [the Act] to be disclosed to [the plaintiff] and the information   is material to [a claim under the Act], the action may be brought at any time within two years after [the plaintiff's] discovery of the misrepresentation.\"  1681p.~      Plaintiff-respondent Adelaide Andrews visited a doctor's office in Santa Monica, California and there filled out a form listing her name, Social Security number, and other basic information.  An office receptionist named Andrea Andrews (the Impostor) copied the data and moved to Las Vegas, where she attempted to open credit accounts using Andrews' Social Security number and her own last name and address.~      On July 25, September 27, and October 28, 1994, and on January 3, 1995, defendant-petitioner TRW Inc. furnished copies of Andrews' credit report to companies from which the Impostor sought credit.  Andrews did not learn of these disclosures until May 31, 1995, when she sought to refinance her home and in the process received a copy of her credit report reflecting the Impostor's activity.  She sued TRW for injunctive and monetary relief on October 21, 1996, alleging that TRW had violated the Act by failing to verify, predisclosure of her credit report to third parties, that Adelaide Andrews of Santa Monica initiated the credit applications or was otherwise involved in the underlying transactions.  TRW moved for partial summary judgment, arguing, inter alia, that the FCRA's statute of limitations had expired on Andrews' claims stemming from TRW's first two disclosures because both occurred more than two years before she brought suit.  Andrews countered that the limitations period on those claims did not commence until she discovered the disclosures.  The District Court held the two claims time barred, reasoning that 1681p's explicit exception, which covers only misrepresentation claims, precludes judicial attribution of a broader discovery rule to the FCRA.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, applying what it considered to be the \"general federal rule\" that a statute of limitations starts running when a party knows or has reason to know she was injured, unless Congress expressly legislates otherwise.~      Held:~      1. A general discovery rule does not govern 1681p.  That section explicitly delineates the exceptional case in which discovery triggers the two-year limitation, and Andrews' case does not fall within the exceptional category.  Pp. 6-13.~      (a) Even if the Ninth Circuit correctly identified a general presumption in favor of a discovery rule, an issue this case does not oblige this Court to decide, the Appeals Court significantly overstated the scope and force of such a presumption.  That court placed undue weight on Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U.S. 392 , 397, which stands for the proposition that equity tolls the statute of limitations in cases of fraud or concealment, but does not establish a general presumption across all contexts.  The only other cases in which the Court has recognized a prevailing discovery rule, moreover, were decided in two contexts, latent disease and medical malpractice, \"where the cry for [such a] rule is loudest,\" Rotella v. Wood, 528 U.S. 549 , 555.  See United States v. Kubrick, 444 U.S. 111 ; Urie v. Thompson, 337 U.S. 163 .  The Court has also observed that lower federal courts generally apply a discovery rule when a statute is silent on the issue, but has not adopted that rule as its own.  Further, and beyond doubt, the Court has never endorsed the Ninth Circuit's view that Congress can convey its refusal to adopt a discovery rule only by explicit command, rather than by implication from the particular statute's structure or text.  Thus, even if the presumption identified by the Ninth Circuit exists, it would not apply to the FCRA, for that Act does not govern an area of the law that cries out for application of a discovery rule and is not silent on the issue of when the statute of limitations begins to run.  Pp. 6-7.~      (b) Section 1681p's text and structure evince Congress' intent to preclude judicial implication of a discovery rule.  Where Congress explicitly enumerates certain exceptions to a general prohibition, additional exceptions are not to be implied, in the absence of evidence of a contrary legislative intent.  Andrus v. Glover Constr. Co., 446 U.S. 608 , 616-617.  Section 1681p provides that the limitation period generally runs from the date \"liability arises,\" subject to a single exception for cases involving a defendant's willful misrepresentation of material information.  It would distort 1681p's text to convert the exception into the rule.  See Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163 , 168.  Pp. 7-8.~      (c) At least equally telling, reading a general discovery rule into 1681p would in practical effect render the express exception superfluous in all but the most unusual circumstances.  In the paradigmatic setting in which a plaintiff requests a credit report and the reporting agency responds by concealing its wrongdoing, the express exception would do no work other than that performed by a general discovery rule.  The Court rejects Andrews' and the Government's attempt to give some independent scope to the exception by characterizing it as a codification of the doctrine of equitable estoppel.  The scenario constructed by Andrews and the Government to support this characterization is unlikely to occur in reality.  In any event, Andrews and the Government concede that the independent function one could attribute to the express exception under their theory would arise only in rare and egregious cases.  Adopting their position would therefore render the express exception insignificant, if not wholly superfluous, contrary to a cardinal principle of statutory construction.  Pp. 8-11.~      (d) Andrews' two additional arguments in defense of the decision below are unconvincing.  First, her contention that a discovery rule is expressed in the words framing 1681p's general rule \"date on which the liability arises\" is not compelled by the dictionary definition of \"arise\" and is unsupported by this Court's precedent.  Second, Andrews' reliance on 1681p's legislative history fails to convince the Court that Congress intended sub silentio to adopt a general discovery rule in addition to the limited one it expressly provided.  Pp. 11-13.~      2. Because the issue was not raised or briefed below, this Court does not reach Andrews' alternative argument that, even if 1681p does not incorporate a general discovery rule, \"liability\" does not \"arise\" under the FCRA when a violation occurs, but only on a sometimes later date when \"actual damages\" materialize.  The Court notes that the Ninth Circuit has not adopted Andrews' argument and the Government does not join her in advancing it here.  In any event, it is doubtful that the argument, even if valid, would aid Andrews in this case.  Pp. 13-15. 225 F.3d 1063, reversed and remanded.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OFAPPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT~      Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and Stevens, O'Connor, Kennedy, Souter, and Breyer, JJ., joined.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      This case concerns the running of the two-year statute of limitations governing suits based on the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA or Act), as added, 84 Stat. 1127, and amended, 15 U.S.C.  1681 et seq. (1994 ed. and Supp. V).1  The time prescription appears in 1681p, which sets out a general rule and an exception.  Generally, an action to enforce any liability created by the Act may be brought \"within two years from the date on which the liability arises.\"  The exception covers willful misrepresentation of \"any information required under [the Act] to be disclosed to [the plaintiff]\": when such a representation is material to a claim under the Act, suit may be brought \"within two years after [the plaintiff's] discovery   of the misrepresentation.\"~    ~    ~      2~      Section 1681p's exception is not involved in this case; the complaint does not allege misrepresentation of information that the FCRA \"require[s]   to be disclosed to [the plaintiff].\"  Plaintiff-respondent Adelaide Andrews nevertheless contends, and the Ninth Circuit held, that 1681p's generally applicable two-year limitation commenced to run on Andrews' claims only upon her discovery of defendant-petitioner TRW Inc.'s alleged violations of the Act.~    ~    ~      3~      We hold that a discovery rule does not govern 1681p.  That section explicitly delineates the exceptional case in which discovery triggers the two-year limitation.  We are not at liberty to make Congress' explicit exception the general rule as well.~    ~    ~      4~      * A~    ~    ~      5~      Congress enacted the FCRA in 1970 to promote efficiency in the Nation's banking system and to protect consumer privacy.  See 15 U.S.C.  1681 (a) (1994 ed.).  As relevant here, the Act seeks to accomplish those goals by requiring credit reporting agencies to maintain \"reasonable procedures\" designed \"to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information\" contained in credit reports, 1681e(b), and to \"limit the furnishing of [such reports] to\" certain statutorily enumerated purposes, 1681e(a); 15 U.S.C.  1681b (1994 ed. and Supp. V).  The Act creates a private right of action allowing injured consumers to recover \"any actual damages\" caused by negligent violations and both actual and punitive damages for willful noncompliance.  See 15 U.S.C.  1681n 1681o (1994 ed.).2~    ~    B~    ~      6~      The facts of this case are for the most part undisputed.  On June 17, 1993, Adelaide Andrews visited a radiologist's office in Santa Monica, California.  She filled out a new patient form listing certain basic information, including her name, birth date, and Social Security number.  Andrews handed the form to the office receptionist, one Andrea Andrews (the Impostor), who copied the information and thereafter moved to Las Vegas, Nevada.  Once there, the Impostor attempted on numerous occasions to open credit accounts using Andrews' Social Security number and her own last name and address.~    ~    ~      7~      On four of those occasions, the company from which the Impostor sought credit requested a report from TRW.  Each time, TRW's computers registered a match between Andrews' Social Security number, last name, and first initial and therefore responded by furnishing her file.  TRW thus disclosed Andrews' credit history at the Impostor's request to a bank on July 25, 1994; to a cable television company on September 27, 1994; to a department store on October 28, 1994; and to another credit provider on January 3, 1995.  All recipients but the cable company rejected the Impostor's applications for credit.~    ~    ~      8~      Andrews did not learn of these disclosures until May 31, 1995, when she sought to refinance her home mortgage and in the process received a copy of her credit report reflecting the Impostor's activity.  Andrews concedes that TRW promptly corrected her file upon learning of its mistake.  She alleges, however, that the blemishes on her report not only caused her inconvenience and emotional distress, they also forced her to abandon her refinancing efforts and settle for an alternative line of credit on less favorable terms.~    ~    ~      9~      On October 21, 1996, almost 17 months after she discovered the Impostor's fraudulent conduct and more than two years after TRW's first two disclosures, Andrews filed suit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.  Her complaint stated two categories of FCRA claims against TRW, only the first of which is relevant here.3  See App. 15-17.  Those claims alleged that TRW's four disclosures of her information in response to the Impostor's credit applications were improper because TRW failed to verify, predisclosure, that Adelaide Andrews of Santa Monica initiated the requests or was otherwise involved in the underlying transactions.  Andrews asserted that by processing requests that matched her profile on Social Security number, last name, and first initial but did not correspond on other key identifiers, notably birth date, address, and first name, TRW had facilitated the Impostor's identity theft.  According to Andrews, TRW's verification failure constituted a willful violation of 1681e(a), which requires credit reporting agencies to maintain \"reasonable procedures\" to avoid improper disclosures.  She sought injunctive relief, punitive damages, and compensation for the \"expenditure of time and money, commercial impairment, inconvenience, embarrassment, humiliation and emotional distress\" that TRW had allegedly inflicted upon her.  App. 15-16.~    ~    ~      10~      TRW moved for partial summary judgment, arguing, inter alia, that the FCRA's statute of limitations had expired on Andrews' claims based on the July 25 and September 27, 1994, disclosures because both occurred more than two years before she brought suit.  Andrews countered that her claims as to all four disclosures were timely because the limitations period did not commence until May 31, 1995, the date she learned of TRW's alleged wrongdoing.  The District Court, agreeing with TRW that 1681p does not incorporate a general discovery rule, held that relief stemming from the July and September 1994 disclosures was time barred.  Andrews v. Trans Union Corp., 7 F. Supp. 2d 1056, 1066-1067 (CD Cal. 1998).4~    ~    ~      11~      The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed this ruling, applying what it considered to be the \"general federal rule   that a federal statute of limitations begins to run when a party knows or has reason to know that she was injured.\" 225 F.3d 1063, 1066 (2000).  The court rejected the District Court's conclusion that the text of 1681p, and in particular the limited exception set forth in that section, precluded judicial attribution of such a rule to the FCRA.  \"[U]nless Congress has expressly legislated otherwise,\" the Ninth Circuit declared, \"the equitable doctrine of discovery is read into every federal statute of limitations.\"  Id., at 1067 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Finding no such express directive, the Court of Appeals held that \"none of [Andrews'] injuries were stale when suit was brought.\"  Id., at 1066.  Accordingly, the court reinstated Andrews' improper disclosure claims and remanded them for trial.~    ~    ~      12~      In holding that 1681p incorporates a general discovery rule, the Ninth Circuit parted company with four other Circuits; those courts have concluded that a discovery exception other than the one Congress expressed may not be read into the Act.  See Clark v. State Farm Fire  Casualty Ins. Co., 54 F.3d 669 (CA10 1995); Rylewicz v. Beaton Servs., Ltd., 888 F.2d 1175 (CA7 1989); Houghton v. Insurance Crime Prevention Institute, 795 F.2d 322 (CA3 1986); Clay v. Equifax, Inc., 762 F.2d 952 (CA11 1985).  We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict, 532 U.S. 902 (2001), and now reverse.~    ~    II~    ~      13~      The Court of Appeals rested its decision on the premise that all federal statutes of limitations, regardless of context, incorporate a general discovery rule \"unless Congress has expressly legislated otherwise.\"  225 F.3d, at 1067.  To the extent such a presumption exists, a matter this case does not oblige us to decide, the Ninth Circuit conspicuously overstated its scope and force.~    ~    ~      14~      The Appeals Court principally relied on our decision in Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U.S. 392 (1946).  See 225 F.3d, at 1067.  In that case, we instructed with particularity that \"where a plaintiff has been injured by fraud and remains in ignorance of it without any fault or want of diligence or care on his part, the bar of the statute does not begin to run until the fraud is discovered.\"  Holmberg, 327 U.S., at 397 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Holmberg thus stands for the proposition that equity tolls the statute of limitations in cases of fraud or concealment; it does not establish a general presumption applicable across all contexts.  The only other cases in which we have recognized a prevailing discovery rule, moreover, were decided in two contexts, latent disease and medical malpractice, \"where the cry for [such a] rule is loudest,\" Rotella v. Wood, 528 U.S. 549 , 555 (2000).  See United States v. Kubrick, 444 U.S. 111 (1979); Urie v. Thompson, 337 U.S. 163 (1949).~    ~    ~      15~      We have also observed that lower federal courts \"generally apply a discovery accrual rule when a statute is silent on the issue.\"  Rotella, 528 U.S., at 555; see also Klehr v. A. O. Smith Corp., 521 U.S. 179 , 191 (1997) (citing Connors v. Hallmark  Son Coal Co., 935 F.2d 336, 342 (CADC 1991), for the proposition that \"federal courts generally apply [a] discovery accrual rule when [the] statute does not call for a different rule\").  But we have not adopted that position as our own.  And, beyond doubt, we have never endorsed the Ninth Circuit's view that Congress can convey its refusal to adopt a discovery rule only by explicit command, rather than by implication from the structure or text of the particular statute.~    ~    ~      16~      The Ninth Circuit thus erred in holding that a generally applied discovery rule controls this case.  The FCRA does not govern an area of the law that cries out for application of a discovery rule, nor is the statute \"silent on the issue\" of when the statute of limitations begins to run.  Section 1681p addresses that precise question; the provision reads:~    ~    ~      17~      \"An action to enforce any liability created under [the Act] may be brought   within two years from the date on which the liability arises, except that where a defendant has materially and willfully misrepresented any information required under [the Act] to be disclosed to an individual and the information so misrepresented is material to the establishment of the defendant's liability to that individual under [the Act], the action may be brought at any time within two years after discovery by the individual of the misrepresentation.\"~    ~    ~      18~      We conclude that the text and structure of 1681p evince Congress' intent to preclude judicial implication of a discovery rule.~    ~    ~      19~      \"Where Congress explicitly enumerates certain exceptions to a general prohibition, additional exceptions are not to be implied, in the absence of evidence of a contrary legislative intent.\"  Andrus v. Glover Constr. Co., 446 U.S. 608 , 616-617 (1980).  Congress provided in the FCRA that the two-year statute of limitations runs from \"the date on which the liability arises,\" subject to a single exception for cases involving a defendant's willful misrepresentation of material information.  1681p.  The most natural reading of 1681p is that Congress implicitly excluded a general discovery rule by explicitly including a more limited one.  See Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163 , 168 (1993) (\"Expressio unius est exclusio alterius.\").  We would distort 1681p's text by converting the exception into the rule.  Cf. United States v. Brockamp, 519 U.S. 347 , 352 (1997) (\"explicit listing of exceptions\" to running of limitations period considered indicative of Congress' intent to preclude \"courts [from] read[ing] other unmentioned, open-ended, 'equitable' exceptions into the statute\").~    ~    ~      20~      At least equally telling, incorporating a general discovery rule into 1681p would not merely supplement the explicit exception contrary to Congress' apparent intent; it would in practical effect render that exception entirely superfluous in all but the most unusual circumstances.  A consumer will generally not discover the tortious conduct alleged here the improper disclosure of her credit history to a potential user until she requests her file from a credit reporting agency.  If the agency responds by concealing the offending disclosure, both a generally applicable discovery rule and the misrepresentation exception would operate to toll the statute of limitations until the concealment is revealed.  Once triggered, the statute of limitations would run under either for two years from the discovery date.  In this paradigmatic setting, then, the misrepresentation exception would have no work to do.~    ~    ~      21~      Both Andrews and the Government, appearing as amicus in her support, attempt to generate some role for the express exception independent of that filled by a general discovery rule.  They conceive of the exception as a codification of the judge-made doctrine of equitable estoppel, which, they argue, operates only after the discovery rule has triggered the limitations period, preventing a defendant from benefiting from its misrepresentation by tolling that period until the concealment is uncovered.~    ~    ~      22~      To illustrate this supposed separate application, Andrews and the Government frame the following scenario: A credit reporting agency injures a consumer by disclosing her file for an improper purpose.  The consumer has no reason to suspect the violation until a year later, when she applies for and is denied credit as a result of the agency's wrongdoing.  At that point, the Government asserts, \"the consumer would presumably be put on inquiry notice of the violation, and the discovery rule would start the running of the normal limitation period.\"  Brief for United States et al. as Amici Curiae 22 (emphasis omitted); see Tr. of Oral Arg. 35-36 (argument in accord by Andrews' counsel).  Some days or months later, the consumer follows up on her suspicions by requesting a copy of her credit report, to which the agency responds by concealing the initial improper disclosure.  According to Andrews and the Government, the misrepresentation exception would then operate to toll the already-commenced limitations period until the agency reveals its wrongdoing.~    ~    ~      23~      We reject this argument for several reasons.  As an initial matter, we are not persuaded by this effort to distinguish the practical function of a discovery rule and the express exception, because we doubt that the supporting scenario is likely to occur outside the realm of theory.  The fatal weakness in the narrative is its assumption that a consumer would be charged with constructive notice of an improper disclosure upon denial of a credit application.  If the consumer habitually paid her bills on time, the denial might well lead her to suspect a prior credit agency error.  But the credit denial would place her on \"inquiry notice,\" and the discovery rule would trigger the limitations period at that point, only if a reasonable person in her position would have learned of the injury in the exercise of due diligence.  See Stone v. Williams, 970 F.2d 1043, 1049 (CA2 1992) (\"The duty of inquiry having arisen, plaintiff is charged with whatever knowledge an inquiry would have revealed.\"); 2 C. Corman, Limitation of Actions 11.1.6, p. 164 (1991) (\"It is obviously unreasonable to charge the plaintiff with failure to search for the missing element of the cause of action if such element would not have been revealed by such search.\").~    ~    ~      24~      In the usual circumstance, the plaintiff will gain knowledge of her injury from the credit reporting agency.  The scenario put forth by Andrews and the Government, however, requires the assumption that, even if the consumer exercised reasonable diligence by requesting her credit report without delay, she would not in fact learn of the disclosure because the credit reporting agency would conceal it.  The uncovering of that concealment would remain the triggering event for both the discovery rule and the express exception.  In this scenario, as in the paradigmatic one, the misrepresentation exception would be superfluous.~    ~    ~      25~      In any event, both Andrews and the Government concede that the independent function one could attribute to the express exception would arise only in \"rare and egregious case[s].\"  Brief for Respondent 32-33; see Brief for United States et al. as Amici Curiae 24 (implied discovery rule would apply in \"vast majority\" of cases).  The result is that a rule nowhere contained in the text of 1681p would do the bulk of that provision's work, while a proviso accounting for more than half of that text would lie dormant in all but the most unlikely situations.~    ~    ~      26~      It is \"a cardinal principle of statutory construction\" that \"a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant.\"  Duncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. ___, ___ (2001) (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted); see United States v. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528 , 538-539 (1955) (\"It is our duty 'to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.' \" (quoting Montclair v. Ramsdell, 107 U.S. 147 , 152 (1883))).  \"[W]ere we to adopt [Andrews'] construction of the statute,\" the express exception would be rendered \"insignificant, if not wholly superfluous.\"  Duncan, 533 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  We are \"reluctant to treat statutory terms as surplusage in any setting,\" id., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (internal alteration and quotation marks omitted), and we decline to do so here.5~    ~    ~      27~      Andrews advances two additional arguments in defense of the decision below, neither of which we find convincing.  She contends, first, that the words \"date on which the liability arises\" the phrase Congress used to frame the general rule in 1681p \"literally expres[s]\" a discovery rule because liability does not \"arise\" until it \"present[s] itself\" or comes to the attention of the potential plaintiff.  Brief for Respondent 13.  The dictionary definition of the word \"arise\" does not compel such a reading; to the contrary, it can be used to support either party's position.  See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 117 (1966) (arise defined as \"to come into being\"; \"to come about\"; or \"to become apparent in such a way as to demand attention\"); Black's Law Dictionary 138 (rev. 4th ed. 1968) (\"to come into being or notice\").  And TRW offers a strong argument that we have in fact construed that word to imply the result Andrews seeks to avoid.  See Brief for Petitioner 16-20 (citing, inter alia, McMahon v. United States, 342 U.S. 25 (1951) (statute of limitations triggered on date \"cause of action arises\" incorporates injury-occurrence rule)).  On balance, we conclude, the phrase \"liability arises\" is not particularly instructive, much less dispositive of this case.~    ~    ~      28~      Similarly unhelpful, in our view, is Andrews' reliance on the legislative history of 1681p.  She observes that early versions of that provision, introduced in both the House and Senate, keyed the start of the limitations period to \"the date of the occurrence of the violation.\"  S. 823, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., 618  (1969); H. R. 16340, 91st Cong., 2d. Sess., 27 (1970); H. R. 14765, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., 617 (1969).  From the disappearance of that language in the final version of 1681p, Andrews infers a congressional intent to reject the rule that the deleted words would have plainly established.~    ~    ~      29~      As TRW notes, however, Congress also heard testimony urging it to enact a statute of limitations that runs from \"the date on which the violation is discovered\" but declined to do so.  Hearings before the Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs of the House Committee on Banking and Currency, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., 188 (1970).  In addition, the very change to 1681p's language on which Andrews relies could be read to refute her position.  The misrepresentation exception was added at the same time Congress changed the language \"date of the occurrence of the violation\" to \"liability arises.\"  Compare S. 823, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., 618 (1969); H. R. 16340, 91st Cong., 2d. Sess., 27 (1970); H. R. 14765, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., 617 (1969), with H. R. Rep. No. 91-1587, p. 22 (1970).  We doubt that Congress, when it inserted a carefully worded exception to the main rule, intended simultaneously to create a general discovery rule that would render that exception superfluous.  In sum, the evidence of the early incarnations of 1681p, like the \"liability arises\" language on which Congress ultimately settled, fails to convince us that Congress intended sub silentio to adopt a general discovery rule in addition to the limited one it expressly provided.~    ~    III~    ~      30~      In this Court, Andrews for the first time presents an alternative argument based on the \"liability arises\" language of 1681p.  Brief for Respondent 22-25.  She contends that even if 1681p does not incorporate a discovery rule, \"liability\" under the FCRA does not necessarily \"arise\" when a violation of the Act occurs.  Noting that the FCRA's substantive provisions tie \"liability\" to the presence of \"actual damages,\" 1681n, 1681o, and that \"arise\" means at least \"to come into existence,\" Andrews concludes that \"liability arises\" only when actual damages materialize.  Not until then, she maintains, will all the essential elements of a claim coalesce: \"duty, breach, causation, and injury.\"  Brief for Respondent 23; see Hyde v. Hibernia Nat. Bank, 861 F.2d 446, 449 (CA5 1988) (\"The requirement that a consumer sustain some injury in order to establish a cause of action suggests that the statute should be triggered when the agency issues an erroneous report to an institution with which the consumer is dealing.\").~    ~    ~      31~      Accordingly, Andrews asserts, her claims are timely: The disputed \"liability\" for actual damages did not \"arise\" until May 1995, when she suffered the emotional distress, missed opportunities, and inconvenience cataloged in her complaint; prior to that time, \"she had no FCRA claim to bring,\" Brief for Respondent 24 (emphasis omitted).  Cf. Bay Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v. Ferbar Corp. of Cal., 522 U.S. 192 , 200-201 (1997) (rejecting construction of statute under which limitations period would begin running before cause of action existed in favor of  \"standard rule\" that the period does not commence earlier than the date \"the plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief \").6~    ~    ~      32~      We do not reach this issue because it was not raised or briefed below.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 18-19.  We note, however, that the Ninth Circuit has not embraced Andrews' alternative argument, see 225 F.3d, at 1066 (\"Liability under the [Act] arises when a consumer reporting agency fails to comply with 1681e.\"), and the Government does not join her in advancing it here.~    ~    ~      33~      Further, we doubt that the argument, even if valid, would aid Andrews in this case.  Her claims alleged willful violations of 1681e(a) and are thus governed by 1681n.  At the time of the events in question, that provision stated: \"Any consumer reporting agency   which willfully fails to comply with any requirement imposed under [the Act] with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer in an amount equal to the sum of   any actual damages\" and \"such amount of punitive damages as the court may allow.\"  15 U.S.C.  1681n (1994 ed.).  Punitive damages, which Andrews sought in this case, could presumably be awarded at the moment of TRW's alleged wrongdoing, even if \"actual damages\" did not accrue at that time.  On Andrews' theory, then, at least some of the liability she sought to enforce arose when the violations occurred, and the limitations period therefore began to run at that point.~    ~    ~      34~      *       *       *~    ~    ~      35~      For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      36~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      37~      Scalia, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Thomas, J., joined.~    ~    ~      ~        Notes~      ~      ~        1~          Congress has revised the FCRA extensively since the events at issue, but has not altered the provisions material to this case.~      ~      ~        2~          Under 1996 amendments to 1681n, a plaintiff may also recover statutory damages of between $100 and $1,000 for willful violations.  See 15 U.S.C.  1681n (a)(1)(A) (1994 ed., Supp. V).~      ~      ~        3~          The second alleged that TRW had collected information about the Impostor's activities and inaccurately attributed that activity to Andrews, in violation of its obligation under 1681e(b) to \"follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom [a] report relates.\"  A jury resolved this claim in favor of TRW.   The complaint also stated FCRA claims against Trans Union Corporation, another credit reporting agency involved in the Impostor's conduct.  In addition, Andrews brought a state-law claim against each defendant.  The resolution of these claims is not at issue here.~      ~      ~        4~          The District Court also granted summary judgment to TRW on the two remaining improper disclosure claims, reasoning that TRW maintained adequate procedures and that the disputed disclosures had been made for a permissible purpose as defined by 1681b.  See Andrews v. Trans Union Corp., 7 F. Supp. 2d, at 1068-1071.  The Ninth Circuit reversed that ruling.  225 F.3d 1063, 1067-1068 (2000).  Such questions, the Appeals Court held, \"needed determination by a jury not a judge.\"  Id., at 1068.~      ~      ~        5~          Similarly, even if we agreed that the discovery and equitable estoppel doctrines could comfortably coexist in this setting, we would reject the contention that we are therefore free to incorporate both into the FCRA.  As we have explained, see supra, at 7-8, we read Congress' codification of one judge-made doctrine not as a license to imply others, but rather as an intentional rejection of those it did not codify.~      ~      ~        6~          The opinion concurring in the judgment rips Bay Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v. Ferbar Corp. of Cal., 522 U.S. 192 , 201 (1997), from its berth, see post, at 1, 3; we here set the record straight.  The question presented in Bay Area Laundry was whether a statute of limitations could commence to run on one day while the right to sue ripened on a later day.  We answered that question, and only that question, \"no,\" unless the statute indicates otherwise.  See Bay Area Laundry, 522 U.S., at 200-201.  Continuing on beyond the place where the concurrence in the judgment leaves off, we clarified: \"Unless Congress has told us otherwise in the legislation at issue, a cause of action does not become 'complete and present' for limitations purposes until the plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief.  See Reiter v. Cooper, 507 U.S. 258 , 267 (1993) (\"While it is theoretically possible for a statute to create a cause of action that accrues at one time for the purpose of calculating when the statute of limitations begins to run, but at another time for the purpose of bringing suit, we will not infer such an odd result in the absence of any such indication in the statute.\").\"  Id., at 201.~      ~    ~    Scalia, J., concurring in judgment~    ~      38~      Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring in the judgment.~    ~    ~      39~      As the Court notes, ante, at 5, 6, the Court of Appeals based its decision on what it called the \"general federal rule   that a federal statute of limitations begins to run when a party knows or has reason to know that she was injured,\" 225 F.3d 1063, 1066 (CA9 2000).  The Court declines to say whether that expression of the governing general rule is correct.  See ante, at 6 (\"To the extent such a presumption exists, a matter this case does not oblige us to decide  \").  There is in my view little doubt that it is not, and our reluctance to say so today is inexplicable, given that we held, a mere four years ago, that a statute of limitations which says the period runs from \"the date on which the cause of action arose,\" 29 U.S.C.  1451 (f)(1) (1994 ed.), \"incorporates the standard rule that the limitations period commences when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action,\" Bay Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v. Ferbar Corp. of Cal., 522 U.S. 192 , 201 (1997) (emphasis added and internal quotation marks omitted).1~    ~    ~      40~      Bay Area Laundry quoted approvingly our statement in Clark v. Iowa City, 20 Wall. 583, 589 (1875), that \"[a]ll statutes of limitation begin to run when the right of action is complete   .\"  This is unquestionably the traditional rule: absent other indication, a statute of limitations begins to run at the time the plaintiff \"has the right to apply to the court for relief   .\"  1 H. Wood, Limitation of Actions 122a, p. 684 (4th ed. 1916).  \"That a person entitled to an action has no knowledge of his right to sue, or of the facts out of which his right arises, does not postpone the period of limitation.\"  2 Wood, supra, 276c(1), at 1411.~    ~    ~      41~      The injury-discovery rule applied by the Court of Appeals is bad wine of recent vintage.  Other than our recognition of the historical exception for suits based on fraud, e.g., Bailey v. Glover, 21 Wall. 342, 347-350 (1875), we have deviated from the traditional rule and imputed an injury-discovery rule to Congress on only one occasion.  Urie v. Thompson, 337 U.S. 163 , 169-171 (1949).2  We did so there because we could not imagine that legislation as \"humane\" as the Federal Employers' Liability Act would bar recovery for latent medical injuries.  Id., at 170.  We repeated this sentiment in Rotella v. Wood, 528 U.S. 549 , 555 (2000), saying that the \"cry for a discovery rule is loudest\" in the context of medical-malpractice suits; and we repeat it again today with the assertion that the present case does not involve \"an area of the law that cries out for application of a discovery rule,\" ante, at 7.  These cries, however, are properly directed not to us, but to Congress, whose job it is to decide how \"humane\" legislation should be or (to put the point less tendentiously) to strike the balance between remediation of all injuries and a policy of repose.  See Amy v. Watertown (No. 2), 130 U.S. 320 , 323-324 (1889) (\"[T]he cases in which [the statute of limitations may be suspended by causes not mentioned in the statute itself] are very limited in character, and are to be admitted with great caution; otherwise the court would make the law instead of administering it\").~    ~    ~      42~      Congress has been operating against the background rule recognized in Bay Area Laundry for a very long time.  When it has wanted us to apply a different rule, such as the injury-discovery rule, it has said so.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C.  1030 (g) (1994 ed., Supp. V).3  See also, e.g., 15 U.S.C.  77m (1994 ed., Supp. V);4 42 U.S.C.  9612 (d)(2) (1994 ed.).5  To apply a new background rule to previously enacted legislation would reverse prior congressional judgments; and to display uncertainty regarding the current background rule makes all unspecifying new legislation a roll of the dice.  Today's opinion, in clarifying the meaning of 15 U.S.C.  1681p casts the meaning of innumerable other limitation periods in doubt.~    ~    ~      43~      Because there is nothing in this statute to contradict the rule that a statute of limitations begins to run when the cause of action is complete, I concur in the judgment of the Court.~    ~    ~      ~        Notes~      ~      ~        1~          This analysis does not, as the Court asserts, ante, at 14, n. 6, \"ri[p] Bay Area Laundry . . . from its berth.\"  The question presented on which certiorari was granted in the case was not, as the Court now recharacterizes it, the generalized inquiry \"whether a statute of limitations could commence to run on one day while the right to sue ripened on a later day,\" ibid., but rather (as set forth in somewhat abbreviated form in petitioner Bay Area Laundry's merits brief) the much more precise question, \"When does the statute of limitations begin to run on an action under the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act, 29 U.S.C.  1381 et seq., to collect overdue employer withdrawal liability payments? \"  Brief for Petitioner in No. 96-370, O.T. 1997, p. i.  (Framing of the question in respondent Ferbar Corporation's merits brief was virtually identical.)  The Court's Bay Area Laundry opinion introduced its discussion of the merits as follows:   \"[T]he Ninth Circuit's decision conflicts with an earlier decision of the District of Columbia Circuit [which] held that the statute of limitations . . . runs from the date the employer misses a scheduled payment, not from the date of complete withdrawal. . . . The Third and Seventh Circuits have also held that the statute of limitations runs from the failure to make a payment . . . . We granted certiorari . . . to resolve these conflicts.\"  522 U.S., at 200.   The Court's assertion that we did not answer the question presented, and did not resolve the conflicts held only that the Ninth Circuit was wrong to say that the limitations period commenced before there was a right of action, and not that the other circuits were right to say that the period commenced upon the failure to make a payment is as erroneous as it is implausible.  Bay Area Laundry held that the cause of action arose when \"the employer violated an obligation owed the plan,\" id., at 202, because \"the standard rule\" is that the period begins to run when the plaintiff has a \"complete and present cause of action,\" id., at 201 (internal quotation marks omitted).~      ~      ~        2~          As the Court accurately notes, ante, at 6-7, in one other case we simply observed (without endorsement) that several Courts of Appeals had substituted injury-discovery for the traditional rule in medical-malpractice actions under the Federal Tort Claims Act, see United States v.

MALESKO~    No. 00-860.~    Supreme Court of the United States~    Argued October 1, 2001Decided November 27, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      Petitioner Correctional Services Corporation (CSC), under contract with the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), operates Le Marquis Community Correctional Center (Le Marquis), a facility that houses federal inmates. After respondent, a federal inmate afflicted with a heart condition limiting his ability to climb stairs, was assigned to a bedroom on Le Marquis' fifth floor, CSC instituted a policy requiring inmates residing below the sixth floor to use the stairs rather than the elevator. Respondent was exempted from this policy. But when a CSC employee forbade respondent to use the elevator to reach his bedroom, he climbed the stairs, suffered a heart attack, and fell. Subsequently, respondent filed this damages action against CSC and individual defendants, alleging, inter alia, that they were negligent in refusing him the use of the elevator. The District Court treated the complaint as raising claims under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388, in which this Court recognized for the first time an implied private action for damages against federal officers alleged to have violated a citizen's constitutional rights. In dismissing the suit, the District Court relied on FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, reasoning, inter alia, that a Bivens action may only be maintained against an individual, not a corporate entity. The Second Circuit reversed in pertinent part and remanded, remarking, with respect to CSC, that Meyer expressly declined to expand the category of defendants against whom Bivens-type actions may be brought to include not only federal agents, but also federal agencies. But the court reasoned that such private entities should be held liable under Bivens to accomplish the important Bivens goal of providing a remedy for constitutional violations.~      Held: Bivens' limited holding may not be extended to confer a right of action for damages against private entities acting under color of federal law. The Court's authority to imply a new constitutional tort, not expressly authorized by statute, is anchored in its general jurisdiction to decide all cases arising under federal law. The Court first exercised this authority in Bivens. From a discussion of that and subsequent cases, it is clear that respondent's claim is fundamentally different from anything the Court has heretofore recognized. In 30 years of Bivens jurisprudence, the Court has extended its holding only twice, to provide an otherwise nonexistent cause of action against individual officers alleged to have acted unconstitutionally, e.g., Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, and to provide a cause of action for a plaintiff who lacked any alternative remedy for harms caused by an individual officer's unconstitutional conduct, e.g., Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228, 245. Where such circumstances are not present, the Court has consistently rejected invitations to extend Bivens, often for reasons that foreclose its extension here. See, e.g., Bush v. Lucas, 462 U.S. 367. Bivens' purpose is to deter individual federal officers, not the agency, from committing constitutional violations. Meyer made clear, inter alia, that the threat of suit against an individual's employer was not the kind of deterrence contemplated by Bivens. 510 U.S., at 485. This case is, in every meaningful sense, the same. For if a corporate defendant is available for suit, claimants will focus their collection efforts on it, and not the individual directly responsible for the alleged injury. On Meyer's logic, inferring a constitutional tort remedy against a private entity like CSC is therefore foreclosed. Respondent's claim that requiring private corporations acting under color of federal law to pay for the constitutional harms they commit is the best way to discourage future harms has no relevance to Bivens, which is concerned solely with deterring individual officers' unconstitutional acts. There is no reason here to consider extending Bivens beyond its core premise. To begin with, no federal prisoners enjoy respondent's contemplated remedy. If such a prisoner in a BOP facility alleges a constitutional deprivation, his only remedy lies against the offending individual officer. Whether it makes sense to impose asymmetrical liability costs on private prison facilities alone is a question for Congress to decide. Nor is this a situation in which claimants in respondent's shoes lack effective remedies. It was conceded at oral argument that alternative remedies are at least as great, and in many respects greater, than anything that could be had under Bivens. For example, federal prisoners in private facilities enjoy a parallel tort remedy that is unavailable to prisoners housed in government facilities. Inmates in respondent's position also have full access to remedial mechanisms established by the BOP, including suits in federal court for injunctive relief-long recognized as the proper means for preventing entities from acting unconstitutionally-and grievances filed through the BOP's Administrative Remedy Program. Pp. 4-12.~      229 F.3d 374, reversed.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT~      Rehnquist, C. J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ., joined.~      Opinion of the Court~      Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      We decide here whether the implied damages action first recognized in Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), should be extended to allow recovery against a private corporation operating a halfway house under contract with the Bureau of Prisons. We decline to so extend Bivens.~    ~    ~      2~      Petitioner Correctional Services Corporation (CSC), under contract with the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), operates Community Corrections Centers and other facilities that house federal prisoners and detainees.1 Since the late 1980's, CSC has operated Le Marquis Community Correctional Center (Le Marquis), a halfway house located in New York City. Respondent John E. Malesko is a former federal inmate who, having been convicted of federal securities fraud in December 1992, was sentenced to a term of 18 months' imprisonment under the supervision of the BOP. During his imprisonment, respondent was diagnosed with a heart condition and treated with prescription medication. Respondent's condition limited his ability to engage in physical activity, such as climbing stairs.~    ~    ~      3~      In February 1993, the BOP transferred respondent to Le Marquis where he was to serve the remainder of his sentence. Respondent was assigned to living quarters on the fifth floor. On or about March 1, 1994, petitioner instituted a policy at Le Marquis requiring inmates residing below the sixth floor to use the staircase rather than the elevator to travel from the first-floor lobby to their rooms. There is no dispute that respondent was exempted from this policy on account of his heart condition. Respondent alleges that on March 28, 1994, however, Jorge Urena, an employee of petitioner, forbade him to use the elevator to reach his fifth-floor bedroom. Respondent protested that he was specially permitted elevator access, but Urena was adamant. Respondent then climbed the stairs, suffered a heart attack, and fell, injuring his left ear.~    ~    ~      4~      Three years after this incident occurred, respondent filed a pro se action against CSC and unnamed CSC employees in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Two years later, now acting with counsel, respondent filed an amended complaint which named Urena as 1 of the 10 John Doe defendants. The amended complaint alleged that CSC, Urena, and unnamed defendants were \"negligent in failing to obtain requisite medication for [respondent's] condition and were further negligent by refusing [respondent] the use of the elevator.\" App. 12. It further alleged that respondent injured his left ear and aggravated a pre-existing condition \"[a]s a result of the negligence of the Defendants.\" Ibid. Respondent demanded judgment in the sum of $1 million in compensatory damages, $3 million in anticipated future damages, and punitive damages \"for such sum as the Court and/or [j]ury may determine.\" Id., at 13.~    ~    ~      5~      The District Court treated the amended complaint as raising claims under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, supra, and dismissed respondent's cause of action in its entirety. App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a. Relying on our decision in FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471 (1994), the District Court reasoned that \"a Bivens action may only be maintained against an individual,\" and thus was not available against petitioner, a corporate entity. App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a. With respect to Urena and the unnamed individual defendants, the complaint was dismissed on statute of limitations grounds.~    ~    ~      6~      The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. 229 F.3d 374 (2000). That court affirmed dismissal of respondent's claims against individual defendants as barred by the statute of limitations. Respondent has not challenged that ruling, and the parties agree that the question whether a Bivens action might lie against a private individual is not presented here. With respect to petitioner, the Court of Appeals remarked that Meyer expressly declined \" 'to expand the category of defendants against whom Bivens-type actions may be brought to include not only federal agents, but federal agencies as well.' \" 229 F.3d, at 378 (quoting Meyer, supra, at 484 (emphasis deleted)). But the court reasoned that private entities like petitioner should be held liable under Bivens to \"accomplish the ... important Bivens goal of providing a remedy for constitutional violations.\" 229 F.3d, at 380.~    ~    ~      7~      We granted certiorari, 532 U.S. 902 (2001), and now reverse.2~    ~    ~      8~      In Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), we recognized for the first time an implied private action for damages against federal officers alleged to have violated a citizen's constitutional rights. Respondent now asks that we extend this limited holding to confer a right of action for damages against private entities acting under color of federal law. He contends that the Court must recognize a federal remedy at law wherever there has been an alleged constitutional deprivation, no matter that the victim of the alleged deprivation might have alternative remedies elsewhere, and that the proposed remedy would not significantly deter the principal wrongdoer, an individual private employee. We have heretofore refused to imply new substantive liabilities under such circumstances, and we decline to do so here.~    ~    ~      9~      Our authority to imply a new constitutional tort, not expressly authorized by statute, is anchored in our general jurisdiction to decide all cases \"arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C.  1331. See, e.g., Schweiker v. Chilicky, 487 U.S. 412, 420-421 (1988); Bush v. Lucas, 462 U.S. 367, 373-374 (1983). We first exercised this authority in Bivens, where we held that a victim of a Fourth Amendment violation by federal officers may bring suit for money damages against the officers in federal court. Bivens acknowledged that Congress had never provided for a private right of action against federal officers, and that \"the Fourth Amendment does not in so many words provide for its enforcement by award of money damages for the consequences of its violation.\" 403 U.S., at 396. Nonetheless, relying largely on earlier decisions implying private damages actions into federal statutes, see id., at 397 (citing J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U.S. 426, 433 (1964)); 403 U.S., at 402-403, n. 4 (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment) (\"The Borak case is an especially clear example of the exercise of federal judicial power to accord damages as an appropriate remedy in the absence of any express statutory authorization of a federal cause of action\"), and finding \"no special factors counseling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress,\" id., at 395-396, we found an implied damages remedy available under the Fourth Amendment.3~    ~    ~      10~      In the decade following Bivens, we recognized an implied damages remedy under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228 (1979), and the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment, Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14 (1980). In both Davis and Carlson, we applied the core holding of Bivens, recognizing in limited circumstances a claim for money damages against federal officers who abuse their constitutional authority. In Davis, we inferred a new right of action chiefly because the plaintiff lacked any other remedy for the alleged constitutional deprivation. 442 U.S., at 245 (\"For Davis, as for Bivens, it is damages or nothing\"). In Carlson, we inferred a right of action against individual prison officials where the plaintiff's only alternative was a Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) claim against the United States. 446 U.S., at 18-23. We reasoned that the threat of suit against the United States was insufficient to deter the unconstitutional acts of individuals. Id., at 21 (\"Because the Bivens remedy is recoverable against individuals, it is a more effective deterrent than the FTCA remedy\"). We also found it \"crystal clear\" that Congress intended the FTCA and Bivens to serve as \"parallel\" and \"complementary\" sources of liability. 446 U.S., at 19-20.~    ~    ~      11~      Since Carlson we have consistently refused to extend Bivens liability to any new context or new category of defendants. In Bush v. Lucas, supra, we declined to create a Bivens remedy against individual Government officials for a First Amendment violation arising in the context of federal employment. Although the plaintiff had no opportunity to fully remedy the constitutional violation, we held that administrative review mechanisms crafted by Congress provided meaningful redress and thereby foreclosed the need to fashion a new, judicially crafted cause of action. 462 U.S., at 378, n. 14, 386-388. We further recognized Congress' institutional competence in crafting appropriate relief for aggrieved federal employees as a \"special factor counseling hesitation in the creation of a new remedy.\" Id., at 380. See also id., at 389 (noting that \"Congress is in a far better position than a court to evaluate the impact of a new species of litigation between federal employees\"). We have reached a similar result in the military context, Chappell v. Wallace, 462 U.S. 296, 304 (1983), even where the defendants were alleged to have been civilian personnel, United States v. Stanley, 483 U.S. 669, 681 (1987).~    ~    ~      12~      In Schweiker v. Chilicky, we declined to infer a damages action against individual government employees alleged to have violated due process in their handling of Social Security applications. We observed that our \"decisions have responded cautiously to suggestions that Bivens remedies be extended into new contexts.\" 487 U.S., at 421. In light of these decisions, we noted that \"[t]he absence of statutory relief for a constitutional violation ... does not by any means necessarily imply that courts should award money damages against the officers responsible for the violation.\" Id., at 421-422. We therefore rejected the claim that a Bivens remedy should be implied simply for want of any other means for challenging a constitutional deprivation in federal court. It did not matter, for example, that \"[t]he creation of a Bivens remedy would obviously offer the prospect of relief for injuries that must now go unredressed.\" 487 U.S., at 425. See also Bush, supra, at 388 (noting that \"existing remedies do not provide complete relief for the plaintiff\"); Stanley, supra, at 683 (\"[I]t is irrelevant to a special factors analysis whether the laws currently on the books afford Stanley ... an adequate federal remedy for his injuries\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). So long as the plaintiff had an avenue for some redress, bedrock principles of separation of powers foreclosed judicial imposition of a new substantive liability. Chilicky, supra, at 425-427.~    ~    ~      13~      Most recently, in FDIC v. Meyer, we unanimously declined an invitation to extend Bivens to permit suit against a federal agency, even though the agency-because Congress had waived sovereign immunity-was otherwise amenable to suit. 510 U.S., at 484-486. Our opinion emphasized that \"the purpose of Bivens is to deter the officer,\" not the agency. Id., at 485 (emphasis in original) (citing Carlson v. Green, supra, at 21). We reasoned that if given the choice, plaintiffs would sue a federal agency instead of an individual who could assert qualified immunity as an affirmative defense. To the extent aggrieved parties had less incentive to bring a damages claim against individuals, \"the deterrent effects of the Bivens remedy would be lost.\" 510 U.S., at 485. Accordingly, to allow a Bivens claim against federal agencies \"would mean the evisceration of the Bivens remedy, rather than its extension.\" 510 U.S., at 485. We noted further that \"special factors\" counseled hesitation in light of the \"potentially enormous financial burden\" that agency liability would entail. Id., at 486.~    ~    ~      14~      From this discussion, it is clear that the claim urged by respondent is fundamentally different from anything recognized in Bivens or subsequent cases. In 30 years of Bivens jurisprudence we have extended its holding only twice, to provide an otherwise nonexistent cause of action against individual officers alleged to have acted unconstitutionally, or to provide a cause of action for a plaintiff who lacked any alternative remedy for harms caused by an individual officer's unconstitutional conduct. Where such circumstances are not present, we have consistently rejected invitations to extend Bivens, often for reasons that foreclose its extension here.4~    ~    ~      15~      The purpose of Bivens is to deter individual federal officers from committing constitutional violations. Meyer made clear that the threat of litigation and liability will adequately deter federal officers for Bivens purposes no matter that they may enjoy qualified immunity, 510 U.S., at 474, 485, are indemnified by the employing agency or entity, id., at 486, or are acting pursuant to an entity's policy, id., at 473-474. Meyer also made clear that the threat of suit against an individual's employer was not the kind of deterrence contemplated by Bivens. See 510 U.S., at 485 (\"If we were to imply a damages action directly against federal agencies ... there would be no reason for aggrieved parties to bring damages actions against individual officers. [T]he deterrent effects of the Bivens remedy would be lost\"). This case is, in every meaningful sense, the same. For if a corporate defendant is available for suit, claimants will focus their collection efforts on it, and not the individual directly responsible for the alleged injury. See, e.g., TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U.S. 443, 464 (1993) (plurality opinion) (recognizing that corporations fare much worse before juries than do individuals); id., at 490-492 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (same) (citing authorities). On the logic of Meyer, inferring a constitutional tort remedy against a private entity like CSC is therefore foreclosed.~    ~    ~      16~      Respondent claims that even under Meyer's deterrence rationale, implying a suit against private corporations acting under color of federal law is still necessary to advance the core deterrence purpose of Bivens. He argues that because corporations respond to market pressures and make decisions without regard to constitutional obligations, requiring payment for the constitutional harms they commit is the best way to discourage future harms. That may be so, but it has no relevance to Bivens, which is concerned solely with deterring the unconstitutional acts of individual officers. If deterring the conduct of a policy-making entity was the purpose of Bivens, then Meyer would have implied a damages remedy against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; it was after all an agency policy that led to Meyer's constitutional deprivation. Meyer, supra, at 473-474. But Bivens from its inception has been based not on that premise, but on the deterrence of individual officers who commit unconstitutional acts.~    ~    ~      17~      There is no reason for us to consider extending Bivens beyond this core premise here.5 To begin with, no federal prisoners enjoy respondent's contemplated remedy. If a federal prisoner in a BOP facility alleges a constitutional deprivation, he may bring a Bivens claim against the offending individual officer, subject to the defense of qualified immunity. The prisoner may not bring a Bivens claim against the officer's employer, the United States or the BOP. With respect to the alleged constitutional deprivation, his only remedy lies against the individual; a remedy Meyer found sufficient, and which respondent did not timely pursue. Whether it makes sense to impose asymmetrical liability costs on private prison facilities alone is a question for Congress, not us, to decide.~    ~    ~      18~      Nor are we confronted with a situation in which claimants in respondent's shoes lack effective remedies. Cf. Bivens, 403 U.S., at 410 (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment) (\"For people in Bivens' shoes, it is damages or nothing\"); Davis, 442 U.S., at 245 (\"For Davis, as for Bivens, it is damages or nothing\" (internal quotaton marks omitted)). It was conceded at oral argument that alternative remedies are at least as great, and in many respects greater, than anything that could be had under Bivens. Tr. of Oral Arg. 41-42, 43. For example, federal prisoners in private facilities enjoy a parallel tort remedy that is unavailable to prisoners housed in government facilities. See Brief in Opposition 13. This case demonstrates as much, since respondent's complaint in the District Court arguably alleged no more than a quintessential claim of negligence. It maintained that named and unnamed defendants were \"negligent in failing to obtain requisite medication ... and were further negligent by refusing ... use of the elevator.\" App. 12 (emphasis added). It further maintained that respondent suffered injuries \"[a]s a result of the negligence of the Defendants.\" Ibid. (emphasis added). The District Court, however, construed the complaint as raising a Bivens claim, presumably under the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment. Respondent accepted this theory of liability, and he has never sought relief on any other ground. This is somewhat ironic, because the heightened \"deliberate indifference\" standard of Eighth Amendment liability, Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976), would make it considerably more difficult for respondent to prevail than on a theory of ordinary negligence, see, e.g., Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 835 (1994) (\"[D]eliberate indifference describes a state of mind more blameworthy than negligence\").~    ~    ~      19~      This also makes respondent's situation altogether different from Bivens, in which we found alternative state tort remedies to be \"inconsistent or even hostile\" to a remedy inferred from the Fourth Amendment. 403 U.S., at 393-394. When a federal officer appears at the door and requests entry, one cannot always be expected to resist. See id., at 394 (\"[A] claim of authority to enter is likely to unlock the door\"). Yet lack of resistance alone might foreclose a cause of action in trespass or privacy. Ibid. Therefore, we reasoned in Bivens that other than an implied constitutional tort remedy, \"there remain[ed] ... but the alternative of resistance, which may amount to a crime.\" Id., at 395 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Such logic does not apply to respondent, whose claim of negligence or deliberate indifference requires no resistance to official action, and whose lack of alternative tort remedies was due solely to strategic choice.6~    ~    ~      20~      Inmates in respondent's position also have full access to remedial mechanisms established by the BOP, including suits in federal court for injunctive relief and grievances filed through the BOP's Administrative Remedy Program (ARP). See 28 CFR  542.10 (2001) (explaining ARP as providing \"a process through which inmates may seek formal review of an issue which relates to any aspect of their confinement\"). This program provides yet another means through which allegedly unconstitutional actions and policies can be brought to the attention of the BOP and prevented from recurring. And unlike the Bivens remedy, which we have never considered a proper vehicle for altering an entity's policy, injunctive relief has long been recognized as the proper means for preventing entities from acting unconstitutionally.~    ~    ~      21~      In sum, respondent is not a plaintiff in search of a remedy as in Bivens and Davis. Nor does he seek a cause of action against an individual officer, otherwise lacking, as in Carlson. Respondent instead seeks a marked extension of Bivens, to contexts that would not advance Bivens' core purpose of deterring individual officers from engaging in unconstitutional wrongdoing. The caution toward extending Bivens remedies into any new context, a caution consistently and repeatedly recognized for three decades, forecloses such an extension here.~    ~    ~      22~      The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.~    ~    ~      23~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      24~      Scalia, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Thomas, J., joined.~    ~    ~      25~      Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.~    ~    ~      ~        Notes:~      ~      ~        1~          Petitioner is hardly unique in this regard. The BOP has since 1981 relied exclusively on contracts with private institutions and state and local governments for the operation of halfway house facilities to help federal prisoners reintegrate into society. The BOP contracts not only with for-profit entities like petitioner, but also with charitable organizations like Volunteers for America (which operates facilities in Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, New York, and Texas), the Salvation Army (Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas), Progress House Association (Oregon), Triangle Center (Illinois), and Catholic Social Services (Pennsylvania).~      ~      ~        2~          The Courts of Appeals have divided on whether FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471 (1994), forecloses the extension of Bivens to private entities. Compare Hammons v. Norfolk Southern Corp., 156 F.3d 701, 705 (CA6 1998) (\"Nothing in Meyer prohibits a Bivens claim against a private corporation that engages in federal action\"), with Kauffman v. Anglo-American School of Sofia, 28 F.3d 1223, 1227 (CADC 1994) (\"[Under] Meyer's conclusion that public federal agencies are not subject to Bivens liability, it follows that equivalent private entities should not be liable either\"). We hold today that it does.~      ~      ~        3~          Since our decision in Borak, we have retreated from our previous willingness to imply a cause of action where Congress has not provided one. See, e.g., Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U.S. 164, 188 (1994); Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U.S. 11, 15-16 (1979); Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 688 (1979); id., at 717-718 (Rehnquist, J., concurring). Just last Term it was noted that we \"abandoned\" the view of Borak decades ago, and have repeatedly declined to \"revert\" to \"the understanding of private causes of action that held sway 40 years ago.\" Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 287 (2001).~      ~      ~        4~          Justice Stevens' claim that this case does not implicate an \"extension\" of Bivens, post, at 2, 8 (dissenting opinion), might come as some surprise to the Court of Appeals which twice characterized its own holding as \"extending Bivens liability to reach private corporations.\" 229 F.3d 374, 381 (CA2 2000). See also ibid. (\"Bivens liability should extend to private corporations\").~      ~      ~        5~          Justice Stevens claims that our holding in favor of petitioner portends \"tragic consequence[s],\" post, at 6, and \"jeopardize[s] the constitutional rights of . . . tens of thousands of inmates,\" post, at 7. He refers to examples of cases suggesting that private correctional providers routinely abuse and take advantage of inmates under their control. Post, at 7, n. 9 (citing Brief for Legal Aid Society of New York as Amicus Curiae 8-25). See also Brief for American Civil Liberties Union as Amicus Curiae 14-16, and n. 6 (citing and discussing \"abundant\" examples of such abuse). In all but one of these examples, however, the private facility in question housed state prisoners-prisoners who already enjoy a right of action against private correctional providers under 42 U.S.C.  1983. If it is true that the imperatives for deterring the unconstitutional conduct of private correctional providers are so strong as to demand that we imply a new right of action directly from the Constitution, then abuses of authority should be less prevalent in state facilities, where Congress already provides for such liability. That the trend appears to be just the opposite is not surprising given the BOP's oversight and monitoring of its private contract facilities, see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 4-5, 24-26, which Justice Stevens does not mention.~      ~      ~        6~          Where the government has directed a contractor to do the very thing that is the subject of the claim, we have recognized this as a special circumstance where the contractor may assert a defense. Boyle v. United Technologies Corp., 487 U.S. 500 (1988). The record here would provide no basis for such a defense.~      ~    ~    ~      26~      Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring.~    ~    ~      27~      I join the opinion of the Court because I agree that a narrow interpretation of the rationale of Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), would not logically produce its application to the circumstances of this case. The dissent is doubtless correct that a broad interpretation of its rationale would logically produce such application, but I am not inclined (and the Court has not been inclined) to construe Bivens broadly.~    ~    ~      28~      In joining the Court's opinion, however, I do not mean to imply that, if the narrowest rationale of Bivens did apply to a new context, I would extend its holding. I would not. Bivens is a relic of the heady days in which this Court assumed common-law powers to create causes of action-decreeing them to be \"implied\" by the mere existence of a statutory or constitutional prohibition. As the Court points out, ante, at 5, and n. 3, we have abandoned that power to invent \"implications\" in the statutory field, see Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 287 (2001). There is even greater reason to abandon it in the constitutional field, since an \"implication\" imagined in the Constitution can presumably not even be repudiated by Congress. I would limit Bivens and its two follow-on cases (Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228 (1979), and Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14 (1980)) to the precise circumstances that they involved.~    ~    ~      29~      Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.~    ~    ~      30~      In Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), the Court affirmatively answered the question that it had reserved in Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678 (1946): whether a violation of the Fourth Amendment \"by a federal agent acting under color of his authority gives rise to a cause of action for damages consequent upon his unconstitutional conduct.\" 403 U.S., at 389 (emphasis added). Nearly a decade later, in Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14 (1980), we held that a violation of the Eighth Amendment by federal prison officials gave rise to a Bivens remedy despite the fact that the plaintiffs also had a remedy against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). We stated: \"Bivens established that the victims of a constitutional violation by a federal agent have a right to recover damages against the official in federal court despite the absence of any statute conferring such a right.\" 446 U. S., at 18 (emphasis added).~    ~    ~      31~      In subsequent cases, we have decided that a Bivens remedy is not available for every conceivable constitutional violation.1 We have never, however, qualified our holding that Eighth Amendment violations are actionable under Bivens. See Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825 (1994); McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140 (1992). Nor have we ever suggested that a category of federal agents can commit Eighth Amendment violations with impunity.~    ~    ~      32~      The parties before us have assumed that respondent's complaint has alleged a violation of the Eighth Amendment.2 The violation was committed by a federal agent-a private corporation employed by the Bureau of Prisons to perform functions that would otherwise be performed by individual employees of the Federal Government. Thus, the question presented by this case is whether the Court should create an exception to the straightforward application of Bivens and Carlson, not whether it should extend our cases beyond their \"core premise,\" ante, at 9. This point is evident from the fact that prior to our recent decision in FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471 (1994), the Courts of Appeals had consistently and correctly held that corporate agents performing federal functions, like human agents doing so, were proper defendants in Bivens actions.3~    ~    ~      33~      Meyer, which concluded that federal agencies are not suable under Bivens, does not lead to the outcome reached by the Court today. In that case, we did not discuss private corporate agents, nor suggest that such agents should be viewed differently from human ones. Rather, in Meyer, we drew a distinction between \"federal agents\" and \"an agency of the Federal Government,\" 510 U. S., at 473. Indeed, our repeated references to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's (FDIC) status as a \"federal agency\" emphasized the FDIC's affinity to the federal sovereign. We expressed concern that damages sought directly from federal agencies, such as the FDIC, would \"creat[e] a potentially enormous financial burden for the Federal Government.\" Id., at 486. And it must be kept in mind that Meyer involved the FDIC's waiver of sovereign immunity, which, had the Court in Meyer recognized a cause of action, would have permitted the very sort of lawsuit that Bivens presumed impossible: \"a direct action against the Government.\" 510 U.S., at 485.4~    ~    ~      34~      Moreover, in Meyer, as in Bush v. Lucas, 462 U.S. 367 (1983), and Schweiker v. Chilicky, 487 U.S. 412 (1988), we were not dealing with a well-recognized cause of action. The cause of action alleged in Meyer was a violation of procedural due process, and as the Meyer Court noted, \"a Bivens action alleging a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment may be appropriate in some contexts, but not in others.\" 510 U.S., at 484, n. 9. Not only is substantive liability assumed in the present case, but respondent's Eighth Amendment claim falls in the heartland of substantive Bivens claims.5~    ~    ~      35~      Because Meyer does not dispose of this case, the Court claims that the rationales underlying Bivens-namely, lack of alternative remedies and deterrence-are not present in cases in which suit is brought against a private corporation serving as a federal agent. However, common sense, buttressed by all of the reasons that supported the holding in Bivens, leads to the conclusion that corporate agents should not be treated more favorably than human agents.~    ~    ~      36~      First, the Court argues that respondent enjoys alternative remedies against the corporate agent that distinguish this case from Bivens. In doing so, the Court characterizes Bivens and its progeny as cases in which plaintiffs lacked \"any alternative remedy,\" ante, at 8. In Bivens, however, even though the plaintiff's suit against the Federal Government under state tort law may have been barred by sovereign immunity, a suit against the officer himself under state tort law was theoretically possible. Moreover, as the Court recognized in Carlson, Bivens plaintiffs also have remedies available under the FTCA. Thus, the Court is incorrect to portray Bivens plaintiffs as lacking any other avenue of relief, and to imply as a result that respondent in this case had a substantially wider array of non-Bivens remedies at his disposal than do other Bivens plaintiffs.6 If alternative remedies provide a sufficient justification for closing the federal forum here, where the defendant is a private corporation, the claims against the individual defendants in Carlson, in light of the FTCA alternative, should have been rejected as well.7~    ~    ~      37~      It is ironic that the Court relies so heavily for its holding on this assumption that alternative effective remedies-primarily negligence actions in state court-are available to respondent. See ante, at 10-12. Like Justice Harlan, I think it \"entirely proper that these injuries be compensable according to uniform rules of federal law, especially in light of the very large element of federal law which must in any event control the scope of official defenses to liability.\" Bivens, 403 U.S., at 409 (opinion concurring in judgment). And aside from undermining uniformity, the Court's reliance on state tort law will jeopardize the protection of the full scope of federal constitutional rights. State law might have comparable causes of action for tort claims like the Eighth Amendment violation alleged here, see ante, at 10-11, but other unconstitutional actions by prison employees, such as violations of the Equal Protection or Due Process Clauses, may find no parallel causes of action in state tort law. Even though respondent here may have been able to sue for some degree of relief under state law because his Eighth Amendment claim could have been pleaded as negligence, future plaintiffs with constitutional claims less like traditional torts will not necessarily be so situated.8~    ~    ~      38~      Second, the Court claims that the deterrence goals of Bivens would not be served by permitting liability here. Ante, at 8-9 (citing Meyer). It cannot be seriously maintained, however, that tort remedies against corporate employers have less deterrent value than actions against their employees. As the Court has previously noted, the \"organizational structure\" of private prisons \"is one subject to the ordinary competitive pressures that normally help private firms adjust their behavior in response to the incentives that tort suits provide-pressures not necessarily present in government departments.\" Richardson v. McKnight, 521 U.S. 399, 412 (1997). Thus, the private corporate entity at issue here is readily distinguishable from the federal agency in Meyer. Indeed, a tragic consequence of today's decision is the clear incentive it gives to corporate managers of privately operated custodial institutions to adopt cost-saving policies that jeopardize the constitutional rights of the tens of thousands of inmates in their custody.9~    ~    ~      39~      The Court raises a concern with imposing \"asymmetrical liability costs on private prison facilities,\" ante, at 10, and further claims that because federal prisoners in Government-run institutions can only sue officers, it would be unfair to permit federal prisoners in private institutions to sue an \"officer's employer,\" ibid. Permitting liability in the present case, however, would produce symmetry: both private and public prisoners would be unable to sue the principal (i.e., the Government), but would be able to sue the primary federal agent (i.e., the government official or the corporation). Indeed, it is the Court's decision that creates asymmetry-between federal and state prisoners housed in private correctional facilities. Under 42 U.S.C.  1983 a state prisoner may sue a private prison for deprivation of constitutional rights, see Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 936-937 (1982) (permitting suit under 1983 against private corporations exercising \"state action\"), yet the Court denies such a remedy to that prisoner's federal counterpart. It is true that we have never expressly held that the contours of Bivens and 1983 are identical. The Court, however, has recognized sound jurisprudential reasons for parallelism, as different standards for claims against state and federal actors \"would be incongruous and confusing.\" Butz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478, 499 (1978) (internal quotation marks omitted); cf. Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 500 (1954) (\"In view of our decision that the Constitution prohibits the states from maintaining racially segregated public schools, it would be unthinkable that the same Constitution would impose a lesser duty on the Federal Government\"). The value of such parallelism was in fact furthered by Meyer, since 1983 would not have provided the plaintiff a remedy had he pressed a similar claim against a state agency.~    ~    ~      40~      It is apparent from the Court's critical discussion of the thoughtful opinions of Justice Harlan and his contemporaries, ante, at 5, and n. 3, and from its erroneous statement of the question presented by this case as whether Bivens \"should be extended\" to allow recovery against a private corporation employed as a federal agent, ante, at 1, that the driving force behind the Court's decision is a disagreement with the holding in Bivens itself.10 There are at least two reasons why it is improper for the Court to allow its decision in this case to be influenced by that predisposition. First, as is clear from the legislative materials cited in Carlson, 446 U.S., at 19-20, see also ante, at 6, Congress has effectively ratified the Bivens remedy; surely Congress has never sought to abolish it. Second, a rule that has been such a well-recognized part of our law for over 30 years should be accorded full respect by the Members of this Court, whether or not they would have endorsed that rule when it was first announced. For our primary duty is to apply and enforce settled law, not to revise that law to accord with our own notions of sound policy.~    ~    ~      41~      I respectfully dissent.~    ~    ~      ~        Notes:~      ~      ~        1~          See, e.g., FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471 (1994); Schweiker v. Chilicky, 487 U.S. 412 (1988); Bush v. Lucas, 462 U.S. 367 (1983); Chappell v. Wallace, 462 U.S. 296 (1983).~      ~      ~        2~          Although it might have challenged the sufficiency of respondent's constitutional claim, see ante, at 10-11, petitioner has not done so. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 55 (acknowledgment by petitioner that the complaint states an Eighth Amendment violation). Its petition for certiorari presented the single question whether a Bivens cause of action for damages \"should be implied against a private corporation acting under color of federal law.\" Pet. for Cert. (i).~      ~      ~        3~          See Schowengerdt v. General Dynamics Corp., 823 F.2d 1328 (CA9 1987); Reuber v. United States, 750 F.2d 1039 (CADC 1984); Gerena v. Puerto Rico Legal Servs., Inc., 697 F.2d 447 (CA1 1983); Dobyns v. E-Systems, Inc., 667 F.2d 1219 (CA5 1982); Yiamouyiannis v. Chemical Abstracts Serv., 521 F.2d 1392 (CA6 1975).     It is true that one court has overruled its Circuit precedent in light of Meyer and held that Meyer dictates the exclusion of all corporate entities from Bivens liability. Kauffman v. Anglo-American School of Sofia, 28 F.3d 1223 (CADC 1994). However, as another court has explained, that conclusion is in no way compelled by Meyer. See Hammons v. Norfolk Southern Corp., 156 F.3d 701 (CA6 1998).~      ~      ~        4~          Meyer also did not address the present situation because the Court understood the plaintiff's \"real complaint\" in that case to be that the individual officers would be shielded by qualified immunity, 510 U.S., at 485, a concern not present in the case before us, see Richardson v. McKnight, 521 U.S. 399, 412 (1997) (denying qualified immunity to private prison guards in a suit under 42 U.S.C.  1983).~      ~      ~        5~          The Court incorrectly assumes that we are being asked \"to imply a new constitutional tort,\" ante, at 4. The tort here is, however, well established; the only question is whether a remedy in damages is available against a limited class of tortfeasors.~      ~      ~        6~          The Court recognizes that the question whether a Bivens action would lie against the individual employees of a private corporation like Correctional Services Corporation (CSC) is not raised in the present case. Ante, at 3. Both petitioner and respondent have assumed Bivens would apply to these individuals, and the United States as amicus maintains that such liability would be appropriate under Bivens. It does seem puzzling that Bivens liability would attach to the private individual employees of such corporations-subagents of the Federal Government-but not to the corporate agents themselves. However, the United States explicitly maintains this to be the case, and the reasoning of the Court's opinion relies, at least in part, on the availability of a remedy against employees of private prisons. Cf. ante, at 10 (noting that Meyer \"found sufficient\" a remedy against the individual officer, \"which respondent did not timely pursue\" (emphasis added)).~      ~      ~        7~          Although the Court lightly references administrative remedies that might be available to CSC-housed inmates, these are by no means the sort of comprehensive administrative remedies previously contemplated by the Court in Bush and Schweiker.~      ~      ~        8~          The Court blames respondent, who filed his initial complaint pro se, for the lack of state remedies in this case; according to the Court, respondent's failure to bring a negligence suit in state court was \"due solely to strategic choice,\" ante, at 11. Such strategic behavior, generally speaking, is imaginable, but there is no basis in the case before us to charge respondent with acting strategically. Cf. ibid. (discussing how proving a federal constitutional claim would be \"considerably more difficult\" than proving a state negligence claim). Respondent filed his complaint in federal court because he believed himself to have been severely maltreated while in federal custody, and he had no legal counsel to advise him to do otherwise. Without the aid of counsel, respondent not only failed to file for state relief, but he also failed to name the particular prison guard who was responsible for his injuries, resulting in the eventual dismissal of the claims against the individual officers as time barred. Respondent may have been an unsophisticated plaintiff, or, at worst, not entirely diligent about determining the identify of the guards, but it can hardly be said that \"strategic choice\" was the driving force behind respondent's litigation behavior.~      ~      ~        9~          As amici for respondent explain, private prisons are exempt from much of the oversight and public accountability faced by the Bureau of Prisons, a federal entity. See, e.g., Brief for Legal Aid Society of New York as Amicus Curiae 8-25. Indeed, because a private prison corporation's first loyalty is to its stockholders, rather than the public interest, it is no surprise that cost-cutting measures jeopardizing prisoners' rights are more likely in private facilities than in public ones.~      ~      ~        10~          See also ante, at 1 (Scalia, J., concurring) (arguing that Bivens is a \"relic of . . . heady days\" and should be limited, along with Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14 (1980), and Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228 (1979), to its facts). Such hostility to the core of Bivens is not new. See, e.g., Carlson, 446 U.S., at 32 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (\"[T]o dispose of this case as if Bivens were rightly decided would in the words of Mr. Justice Frankfurter be to start with an 'unreality' \"). Nor is there anything new in the Court's disregard for precedent concerning well-established causes of action. See Alexander v.

Readers are requested to notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D. C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.CHICKASAW NATION, PETITIONERv.UNITED STATES~    No. 00-507.~    Supreme Court of the United States~    Argued October 2, 2001Decided November 27, 20011~    ~      Syllabus~      The Indian Regulatory Gaming Act (Gaming Act) provides, as relevant here, that Internal Revenue Code (Code) provisions \"(including []1441, 3402(q), 6041, and 6050I, and chapter 35 ...) concerning the reporting and withholding of taxes\" with respect to gambling operations shall apply to Indian tribes in the same way as they apply to States. 25 U.S.C.  2719(d)(i). Chapter 35 imposes taxes from which it exempts certain state-controlled gambling activities, but says nothing about tax reporting or withholding. Petitioners, the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations, claim that the Gaming Act subsection's explicit parenthetical reference exempts them from paying those chapter 35 taxes from which the States are exempt. Rejecting that claim, the Tenth Circuit held that the subsection applies only to Code provisions concerning tax withholding and reporting.~      Held: Section 2719(d)(i) does not exempt tribes from paying the gambling-related taxes that chapter 35 imposes. Pp. 311.~      (a) The subsection's language outside the parenthetical says that the subsection applies to Code provisions concerning reporting and withholding, and the other four parenthetical references arguably concern reporting and withholding. The Tribes nonetheless claim that the subsection's explicit parenthetical reference to chapter 35 expands the Gaming Act's scope beyond reporting and withholding provisions-to the tax-imposing provisions that chapter 35 contains-and at the very least gives the subsection an ambiguity that can be resolved by applying the canon that statutes are to be construed liberally in favor of Indians with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their benefit. Rejecting their argument reduces the chapter 35 phrase to surplusage, but there is no other reasonable reading of the statute. Pp. 34.~      (b) The statute's language is too strong to give the chapter 35 reference independent operative effect. The unambiguous language outside the parenthetical says without qualification that the subsection applies to \"provisions ... concerning the reporting and withholding of taxes\"; and the language inside the parenthetical, prefaced with the word \"including,\" literally says the same, since to \"include\" means to \"contain.\" The use of parentheses emphasizes the fact that that which is within is meant simply to be illustrative. To give the chapter 35 reference independent operative effect would require seriously rewriting the rest of the statute. One would have to read \"including\" to mean what it does not mean, namely, \"including ... and.\" To read the language outside the parenthetical as if it referred to (1) Code provisions concerning tax reporting and withholding and (2) those \"concerning ... wagering operations\" would be far too convoluted to believe Congress intended it. There is no reason to think Congress intended to sweep within the subsection's scope every Code provision concerning wagering. The subject matter at issue-tax exemption-also counsels against accepting the Tribes' interpretation. This Court can find no comparable instance in which Congress legislated an exemption through a parenthetical numerical cross-reference. Since the more plausible role for the parenthetical to play in this subsection is that of providing an illustrative list of examples, common sense suggests that \"chapter 35\" is simply a bad example that Congress included inadvertently, a drafting mistake. Pp. 46.~      (c) The Gaming Act's legislative history on balance supports this Court's conclusion. And the canons of interpretation to which the Tribes point-that every clause and word of a statute should be given effect and that statutes are to be construed liberally in favor of the Indians with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their benefit-do not determine how to read this statute. First, the canons are guides that need not be conclusive. Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U.S. 105, 115. To accept these canons as conclusive here would produce an interpretation that the Court firmly believes would conflict with congressional intent. Second, specific canons are often countered by some maxim pointing in a different direction. Ibid. The canon requiring a court to give effect to each word \"if possible\" is sometimes offset by the canon permitting a court to reject words as mere surplusage if inadvertently inserted or if repugnant to the rest of the statute. Moreover, the pro-Indian canon is offset by the canon warning against interpreting federal statutes as providing tax exemptions unless the exemptions are clearly expressed. Given the individualized nature of this Court's previous cases, one cannot say that the pro-Indian canon is inevitably stronger, particularly where the interpretation of a congressional statute rather than an Indian treaty is at issue.

We hold that it does not create such an exemption.~    ~    ~      2~      * The relevant Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (Gaming Act) subsection, as codified in 25 U.S.C.  2719(d)(i), reads as follows:~    ~    ~      3~      \"The provisions of [the Internal Revenue Code of 1986] (including sections 1441, 3402(q), 6041, and 6050I, and chapter 35 of such Code) concerning the reporting and withholding of taxes with respect to the winnings from gaming or wagering operations shall apply to Indian gaming operations conducted pursuant to this chapter, or under a Tribal-State compact entered into under section 2710(d)(3) of this title that is in effect, in the same manner as such provisions apply to State gaming and wagering operations.\"~    ~    ~      4~      The subsection says that Internal Revenue Code provisions that \"concer[n] the reporting and withholding of taxes\" with respect to gambling operations shall apply to Indian tribes in the same way as they apply to States. The subsection also says in its parenthetical that those provisions \"includ[e]\" Internal Revenue Code \"chapter 35.\" Chapter 35, however, says nothing about the reporting or the withholding of taxes. Rather, that chapter simply imposes taxes-excise taxes and occupational taxes related to gambling-from which it exempts certain state-controlled gambling activities. See, e.g., 26 U.S.C.  4401(a) (1994 ed.) (imposing 0.25% excise tax on each wager); 4411 (imposing $50 occupational tax on each individual engaged in wagering business); 4402(3) (exempting state-operated gambling operations, such as lotteries).~    ~    ~      5~      In this lawsuit two Native American Indian Tribes, the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations, claim that the Gaming Act subsection exempts them from paying those chapter 35 taxes from which States are exempt. Brief for Petitioners 34-36. They rest their claim upon the subsection's explicit parenthetical reference to chapter 35. The Tenth Circuit rejected their claim on the ground that the subsection, despite its parenthetical reference, applies only to Code provisions that concern the \"reporting and withholding of taxes.\" 208 F.3d 871, 883-884 (2000); see also 210 F.3d 389 (2000). The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, however, reached the opposite conclusion. Little Six, Inc. v. United States, 210 F.3d 1361, 1366 (2000). We granted certiorari in order to resolve the conflict. We agree with the Tenth Circuit.~    ~    II~    ~      6~      The Tribes' basic argument rests upon the subsection's explicit reference to \"chapter 35\"-contained in a parenthetical that refers to four other Internal Revenue Code provisions as well. The subsection's language outside the parenthetical says that the subsection applies to those Internal Revenue Code provisions that concern \"reporting and withholding.\" The other four parenthetical references are to provisions that concern, or at least arguably concern, reporting and withholding. See 26 U.S.C.  1441 (withholding of taxes for nonresident alien); 3402(q) (withholding of taxes from certain gambling winnings); 26 U.S.C.  6041 (reporting by businesses of payments, including payments of gambling winnings, to ohers); 6050I (reporting by businesses of large cash receipts, arguably applicable to certain gambling winnings or receipts).~    ~    ~      7~      But what about chapter 35? The Tribes correctly point out that chapter 35 has nothing to do with \"reporting and withholding.\" Brief for Petitioners 28-29. They add that the reference must serve some purpose, and the only purpose that the Tribes can find is that of expanding the scope of the Gaming Act's subsection beyond reporting and withholding provisions-to the tax-imposing provisions that chapter 35 does contain. The Gaming Act therefore must exempt them (like States) from those tax payment requirements. The Tribes add that at least the reference to chapter 35 makes the subsection ambiguous. And they ask us to resolve the ambiguity by applying a special Indian-related interpretative canon, namely, \" 'statutes are to be construed liberally in favor of the Indians' with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their benefit.\" Brief for Petitioners 13 (quoting Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe, 471 U.S. 759, 766 (1985)).~    ~    ~      8~      We cannot accept the Tribes' claim. We agree with the Tribes that rejecting their argument reduces the phrase \"(including ... chapter 35) ...\" to surplusage. Nonetheless, we can find no other reasonable reading of the statute.~    ~    ~      9~      * The language of the statute is too strong to bend as the Tribes would wish-i.e., so that it gives the chapter 35 reference independent operative effect. For one thing, the language outside the parenthetical is unambiguous. It says without qualification that the subsection applies to \"provisions ... concerning the reporting and withholding of taxes.\" And the language inside the parenthetical, prefaced with the word \"including,\" literally says the same. To \"include\" is to \"contain\" or \"comprise as part of a whole.\" Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 609 (1985). In this instance that which \"contains\" the parenthetical references-the \"whole\" of which the references are \"parts\"-is the phrase \"provisions ... concerning the reporting and withholding of taxes ... .\" The use of parentheses emphasizes the fact that that which is within is meant simply to be illustrative, hence redundant-a circumstance underscored by the lack of any suggestion that Congress intended the illustrative list to be complete. Cf. 26 U.S.C.  3406 (backup withholding provision not mentioned in parenthetical).~    ~    ~      10~      Nor can one give the chapter 35 reference independent operative effect without seriously rewriting the language of the rest of the statute. One would have to read the word \"including\" to mean what it does not mean, namely, \"including ... and.\" One would have to read the statute as if, for example, it placed \"chapter 35\" outside the parenthetical and said \"provisions of the ... Code including chapter 35 and also provisions ... concerning the reporting and withholding of taxes ... .\" Or, one would have to read the language as if it said \"provisions of the ... Code ... concerning the taxation and the reporting and withholding of taxes ... .\" We mention this latter possibility because the congressional bill that became the law before us once did read that way. But when the bill left committee, it contained not the emphasized words (\"the taxation and\") but the cross-reference to chapter 35.~    ~    ~      11~      We recognize the Tribes' claim (made here for the first time) that one could avoid rewriting the statute by reading the language outside the parenthetical as if it referred to two kinds of \"provisions of the ... Code\": first, those \"concerning the reporting and withholding of taxes with respect to the winnings from gaming,\" and, second, those \"concerning ... wagering operations.\" See Reply Brief for Petitioners 8-10. The subsection's grammar literally permits this reading. But that reading, even if ultimately comprehensible, is far too convoluted to believe Congress intended it. Nor is there any reason to think Congress intended to sweep within the subsection's scope every Internal Revenue Code provision concerning wagering-a result that this unnatural reading would accomplish.~    ~    ~      12~      The subject matter at issue also counsels against accepting the Tribes' interpretation. That subject matter is tax exemption. When Congress enacts a tax exemption, it ordinarily does so explicitly. We can find no comparable instance in which Congress legislated an exemption through an inexplicit numerical cross-reference-especially a cross-reference that might easily escape notice.~    ~    ~      13~      As we have said, the more plausible role for the parenthetical to play in this subsection is that of providing an illustrative list of examples. So considered, \"chapter 35\" is simply a bad example-an example that Congress included inadvertently. The presence of a bad example in a statute does not warrant rewriting the remainder of the statute's language. Nor does it necessarily mean that the statute is ambiguous, i.e., \"capable of being understood in two or more possible senses or ways.\" Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 77 (1985). Indeed, in ordinary life, we would understand an analogous instruction-say, \"Test drive some cars, including Plymouth, Nissan, Chevrolet, Ford, and Kitchenaid\"-not as creating ambiguity, but as reflecting a mistake. Here too, in context, common sense suggests that the cross-reference is simply a drafting mistake, a failure to delete an inappropriate cross-reference in the bill that Congress later enacted into law. Cf. Little Six, Inc. v. United States, 229 F.3d 1383, 1385 (CA Fed. 2000) (Dyk, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (\"The language of the provision has all the earmarks of a simple mistake in legislative drafting\").~    ~    B~    ~      14~      The Gaming Act's legislative history on balance supports our conclusion. The subsection as it appeared in the original Senate bill applied both to taxation and to reporting and withholding. It read as follows:~    ~    ~      15~      \"Provisions of the Internal Revenue Code ... concerning the taxation and the reporting and withholding of taxes with respect to gambling or wagering operations shall apply to Indian gaming operations ... the same as they apply to State operations,\" S. 555, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., 37 (1987).~    ~    ~      16~      With the \"taxation\" language present, it would have made sense to include chapter 35, which concerns taxation, in a parenthetical that included other provisions that concern reporting and withholding. But the Senate committee deleted the taxation language. Why did it permit the cross-reference to chapter 35 to remain? Committee documents do not say.~    ~    ~      17~      The Tribes argue that the committee intentionally left it in the statute in order to serve as a substitute for the word \"taxation.\" An amicus tries to support this view by pointing to a tribal representative's testimony that certain Tribes were \"opposed to any indication where Internal Revenue would be collecting taxes from the tribal bingo operations.\" Hearings on S. 555 and S. 1303 before the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., 109 (1987) (statement of Lionel John, Executive Director of United South and Eastern Tribes). Other Tribes thought the \"taxation\" language too \"vague,\" preferring a clear statement \"that the Internal Revenue Service is not being granted authority to tax tribes.\" Id., at 433, 435 (statement of Charles W. Blackwell, Representative of the American Indian Tribal Government and Policy Consultants, Inc.).~    ~    ~      18~      Substitution of \"chapter 35\" for the word \"taxation,\" however, could not have served the tribal witnesses purposes, for doing so took from the bill the very words that made clear the tribes would not be taxed and substituted language that made it more likely they would be taxed. Nor can we believe that anyone seeking to grant a tax exemption would intentionally substitute a confusion-generating numerical cross-reference, see Part A, supra, for pre-existing language that unambiguously carried out that objective. It is far easier to believe that the drafters, having included the entire parenthetical while the word \"taxation\" was still part of the bill, unintentionally failed to remove what had become a superfluous numerical cross-reference-particularly since the tax-knowledgeable Senate Finance Committee never received the opportunity to examine the bill. Cf. S. Doc. No. 100-1, Senate Manual, 30 (1987) (proposed legislation concerning revenue measures shall be referred to the Committee on Finance).~    ~    ~      19~      Finally, the Tribes point to a letter written by one of the Gaming Act's authors, stating that \"by including reference to Chapter 35,\" Congress intended \"that the tax treatment of wagers conducted by tribal governments be the same as that for wagers conducted by state governments under Chapter 35.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 113a. This letter, however, was written after the event. It expresses the views of only one member of the committee. And it makes no effort to explain the critical legislative circumstance, namely, the elimination of the word \"taxation\" from the bill. The letter may express the Senator's interpretive preference, but that preference cannot overcome the language of the statute and the related considerations we have discussed. See Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U.S. 291, 298 (1995) (A \"statement [made] not during the legislative process, but after the statute became law ... is not a statement upon which other legislators might have relied in voting for or against the Act, but it simply represents the views of one informed person on an issue about which others may (or may not) have thought differently\"). Cf. New York Telephone Co. v. New York State Dept. of Labor, 440 U.S. 519, 564, n. 18 (1979) (Powell, J., dissenting) (\"The comments ... of a single Congressman, delivered long after the original passage of the [act at issue], are of no aid in determining congressional intent ...\").~    ~    ~      20~      In sum, to adopt the Tribes' interpretation would read back into the Act the very word \"taxation\" that the Senate committee deleted. We ordinarily will not assume that Congress intended \" 'to enact statutory language that it has earlier discarded in favor of other language.' \" INS v. Cardozanbhyph;Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 443 (1987) (quoting Nachman Corp. v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 446 U.S. 359, 392-393 (1980)); Gulf Oil Corp. v. Copp Paving Co., 419 U.S. 186, 200 (1974) (same); Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U.S. 145, 157 (1973) (same). There is no special reason for doing so here.~    ~    C~    ~      21~      The Tribes point to canons of interpretation that favor their position. The Court has often said that \" 'every clause and word of a statute' \" should, \" 'if possible,' \" be given \" 'effect.' \" United States v. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528, 538-539 (1955) (quoting Montclair v. Ramsdell, 107 U.S. 147, 152 (1883)). The Tribes point out that our interpretation deprives the words \"chapter 35\" of any effect. The Court has also said that \"statutes are to be construed liberally in favor of the Indians with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their benefit.\" Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe, 471 U.S., at 766; South Carolina v. Catawba Tribe, Inc., 476 U.S. 498, 520 (1986) (Blackmun, J., dissenting). The Tribes point out that our interpretation is not to the Indians' benefit.~    ~    ~      22~      Nonetheless, these canons do not determine how to read this statute. For one thing, canons are not mandatory rules. They are guides that \"need not be conclusive.\" Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U.S. 105, 115 (2001). They are designed to help judges determine the Legislature's intent as embodied in particular statutory language. And other circumstances evidencing congressional intent can overcome their force. In this instance, to accept as conclusive the canons on which the Tribes rely would produce an interpretation that we conclude would conflict with the intent embodied in the statute Congress wrote. Cf. Choteau v. Burnet, 283 U.S. 691 (1931) (upholding taxation where congressional intent reasonably clear); Superintendent of Five Civilized Tribes v. Commissioner, 295 U.S. 418 (1935) (same); Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, supra (same). In light of the considerations discussed earlier, we cannot say that the statute is \"fairly capable\" of two interpretations, cf. Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe, supra, at 766, nor that the Tribes' interpretation is fairly \"possible.\"~    ~    ~      23~      Specific canons \"are often countered ... by some maxim pointing in a different direction.\" Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, supra, at 115. The canon requiring a court to give effect to each word \"if possible\" is sometimes offset by the canon that permits a court to reject words \"as surplusage\" if \"inadvertently inserted or if repugnant to the rest of the statute ... .\" K. Llewellyn, The Common Law Tradition 525 (1960). And the latter canon has particular force here where the surplus words consist simply of a numerical cross-reference in a parenthetical. Cf. Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc. v. Shalala, 101 F.3d 984, 990 (CA4 1996) (\"A parenthetical is, after all, a parenthetical, and it cannot be used to overcome the operative terms of the statute\").~    ~    ~      24~      Moreover, the canon that assumes Congress intends its statutes to benefit the tribes is offset by the canon that warns us against interpreting federal statutes as providing tax exemptions unless those exemptions are clearly expressed. See United States v. Wells Fargo Bank, 485 U.S. 351, 354 (1988) (\"[E]xemptions from taxation ... must be unambiguously proved\"); Squire v. Capoeman, 351 U.S. 1, 6 (1956) (\"[T]o be valid, exemptions to tax laws should be clearly expressed\"); United States Trust Co. v. Helvering, 307 U.S. 57, 60 (1939) (\"Exemptions from taxation do not rest upon implication\"). Nor can one say that the pro-Indian canon is inevitably stronger-particularly where the interpretation of a congressional statute rather than an Indian treaty is at issue. Cf. post, at 7. This Court's earlier cases are too individualized, involving too many different kinds of legal circumstances, to warrant any such assessment about the two canons' relative strength. Compare, e.g., Choate v. Trapp, 224 U.S. 665, 675-676 (1912) (interpreting statement in treaty-related Indian land patents that land is \"nontaxable\" as creating property right invalidating later congressional effort to tax); Squire, supra, at 3 (Indian canon offsetting tax canon when related statutory provision and history make clear that language freeing Indian land \" 'of all charge or incumbrance whatsoever' \" includes tax); McClanahan v. Arizona Tax Comm'n, 411 U.S. 164, 174 (1973) (state tax violates principle of Indian sovereignty embodied in treaty), with Mescalero, supra (relying on tax canon to find Indians taxable); Choteau, supra (language makes clear no exemption); Five Tribes, supra (same).~    ~    ~      25~      Consequently, the canons here cannot make the difference for which the Tribes argue. We conclude that the judgments of the Tenth Circuit must be affirmed.~    ~    ~      26~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      27~      O'Connor, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Souter, J., joined.~    ~    ~      ~        Notes:~      ~      ~        *~           Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas join all but Part II-B of this opinion.~      ~    ~    ~      28~      Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Souter joins, dissenting.~    ~    ~      29~      The Court today holds that 25 U.S.C.  2719(d) (1994 ed.) clearly and unambiguously fails to give Indian Nations (Nations) the exemption from federal wagering excise and related occupational taxes enjoyed by the States. Because I believe 2719(d) is subject to more than one interpretation, and because \"statutes are to be construed liberally in favor of the Indians, with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their benefit,\" Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe, 471 U.S. 759, 766 (1985), I respectfully dissent.~    ~    ~      30~      * I agree with the Court that 2719(d) incorporates an error in drafting. I disagree, however, that the section's reference to chapter 35 is necessarily that error.~    ~    ~      31~      As originally proposed in the Senate, the bill that became the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) would have applied all gambling and wagering-related sections of the Internal Revenue Code to the Nations in the same manner as the States:~    ~    ~      32~      \"Provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, concerning the taxation and the reporting and withholding of taxes with respect to gambling or wagering operations shall apply to Indian gaming operations conducted pursuant to this Act the same as they apply to State operations.\" S. 555, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., 37 (1987).~    ~    ~      33~      The Senate Indian Affairs Committee altered the language of this bill in two contradictory ways. It restricted the applicable Code sections to those relating to the \"reporting and withholding of taxes with respect to the winnings\" from gaming operations. 25 U.S.C.  2719(d). It also added a parenthetical listing specific Code sections to be applied to the Nations in the same manner as the States, including chapter 35, a Code provision that relates to gambling operations generally, but not to the reporting and withholding of gambling winnings. Ibid.~    ~    ~      34~      One of these two changes must have been made in error. There is no reason to assume, however, that it must have been the latter. It is equally likely that Congress intended 2719(d) to apply chapter 35 to the Nations, but adopted too restrictive a general characterization of the applicable sections.~    ~    ~      35~      The Court can do no more than speculate that the bill's drafters included the parenthetical while the original restriction was in place and failed to remove it when that restriction was altered. See ante, at 7. Both the inclusion of the parenthetical and the alteration of the restriction occurred in the Senate committee, S. Rep. No. 100-446 (1988), and there is no way to determine the order in which they were adopted. If the parenthetical was added after the restriction, one could just as easily characterize the restriction as an unintentional holdover from a previous version of the bill.~    ~    ~      36~      True, reading the statute to grant the Nations the exemption requires the section's reference to the \"reporting and withholding of taxes with respect to the winnings\" from gaming operations to sustain a meaning the words themselves cannot bear. But the Court's reading of the statute fares no better: It requires excising from 2719(d) Congress' explicit reference to chapter 35. This goes beyond treating statutory language as mere surplusage. See Potter v. United States, 155 U.S. 438, 446 (1894) (the presence of statutory language \"cannot be regarded as mere surplusage; it means something\"); cf. ante, at 3. Surplusage is redundant statutory language, Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore., 515 U.S. 687, 697-698 (1995); W. Popkin, Materials on Legislation: Political Language and the Political Process 214 (3d ed. 2001)-the Court's reading negates language that undeniably bears separate meaning. This is not a step to be undertaken lightly.~    ~    ~      37~      Both approaches therefore require rewriting the statute, see ante, at 4. Neither of these rewritings is necessarily more \"serious\" than the other: At most, each involves doing no more than reversing a change made in committee. Cf. ante, at 4-5.~    ~    ~      38~      The Court argues that, because the reference to chapter 35 occurs in a parenthetical, negating this language does less damage to the statute than concluding that the restrictive language outside the parenthetical is too narrowly drawn. I am aware of no generally accepted canon of statutory construction favoring language outside of parentheses to language within them, see, e.g., W. Eskridge, P. Frickey,  E. Garrett, Legislation and Statutory Interpretation, App. C (2000) (listing canons), nor do I think it wise for the Court to adopt one today. The importance of statutory language depends not on its punctuation, but on its meaning. See United States Nat. Bank of Ore. v. Independent Ins. Agents of America, Inc., 508 U.S. 439, 454 (1993) (\"[A] purported plain-meaning analysis based only on punctuation is necessarily incomplete and runs the risk of distorting a statute's true meaning\").~    ~    ~      39~      The fact that the parenthetical is illustrative does not change the analysis: If Congress' illustration does not match its general description, there is as much reason to question the description as the illustration. Where another general description is possible-and was in fact part of the bill at an earlier stage-Congress' choice of an example that matches the earlier description is at least ambiguous. Moreover, as 2719(d)'s parenthetical specifically lists statutory sections to be applied to the Nations, one might in fact conclude that the doctrine that the specific governs the general, Crawford Fitting Co. v. J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U.S. 437, 445 (1987), makes this specific parenthetical even more significant than the general restriction that follows.~    ~    ~      40~      Nor is negating Congress' clear reference to chapter 35 required by the policy behind the statute. If anything, congressional policy weighs in favor of the Nations. Congress' central purpose in enacting IGRA was \"to provide a statutory basis for the operation of gaming by Indian tribes as a means of promoting tribal economic development, self-sufficiency, and strong tribal governments.\" 2702(1). Exempting Nations from federal gaming taxation in the same manner as States preserves the Nations' sovereignty and avoids giving state gaming a competitive advantage that would interfere with the Nations' ability to raise revenue in this manner.~    ~    II~    ~      41~      Because nothing in the text, legislative history, or underlying policies of 2719(d) clearly resolves the contradiction inherent in the section, it is appropriate to turn to canons of statutory construction. The Nations urge the Court to rely upon the Indian canon, that \"statutes are to be construed liberally in favor of the Indians, with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their benefit,\" Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe, 471 U.S., at 766, as a basis for deciding that the error in 2719(d) lies in the restriction of the subclass, not in the specific listing of chapter 35. \"[R]ooted in the unique trust relationship between the United States and the Indians,\" County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., 470 U.S. 226, 247 (1985), the Indian canon presumes congressional intent to assist its wards to overcome the disadvantages our country has placed upon them. Consistent with this purpose, the Indian canon applies to statutes as well as treaties: The form of the enactment does not change the presumption that Congress generally intends to benefit the Nations. Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe, supra; County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 502 U.S. 251 (1992). In this case, because Congress has chosen gaming as a means of enabling the Nations to achieve self-sufficiency, the Indian canon rightly dictates that Congress should be presumed to have intended the Nations to receive more, rather than less, revenue from this enterprise.~    ~    ~      42~      Of course, the Indian canon is not the only canon with potential applicability in this case. Also relevant is the taxation principle, that exemptions from taxation must be clearly expressed. United States Trust Co. v. Helvering, 307 U.S. 57, 60 (1939); see also ante, at 10. These canons pull in opposite directions, the former favoring the Nations' preferred reading, and the latter favoring the Government's.~    ~    ~      43~      This Court has repeatedly held that, when these two canons conflict, the Indian canon predominates. In Choate v. Trapp, 224 U.S. 665 (1912), a State attempted to rely on the taxation principle to argue that a treaty provision making land granted to Indians nontaxable was merely a bounty, capable of being withdrawn at any time. The Court acknowledged the taxation principle, responding:~    ~    ~      44~      \"But in the Government's dealings with the Indians, the rule is exactly the contrary. The construction, instead of being strict, is liberal; doubtful expressions, instead of being resolved in favor of the United States, are to be resolved in favor of [Indian nations.]\" Id., at 674-675.~    ~    ~      45~      In Squire v. Capoeman, 351 U.S. 1, 3 (1956), the Federal Government had conveyed land to the Nations \" 'free of all charge or encumbrance whatsoever.' \" Although this phrase did not expressly mention nontaxability, the Court held that the language \"might well be sufficient to include taxation,\" id., at 7. Invoking the Indian canon, id., at 6-7, we found the Nations exempt.~    ~    ~      46~      Likewise, in McClanahan v. Arizona Tax Comm'n, 411 U.S. 164 (1973), this Court inferred an exemption from state taxation of property inside reservations from a treaty reserving lands for the exclusive use and occupancy of the Nations. In doing so, the Court noted that: \"It is true, of course, that exemptions from tax laws should, as a general rule, be clearly expressed. But we have in the past construed language far more ambiguous than this as providing a tax exemption for Indians.\" Id., at 176 (citing Squire, supra, at 6).~    ~    ~      47~      As the purpose behind the Indian canon is the same regardless of the form of enactment, supra, at 5, there is no reason to alter the Indian canon's relative strength where a statute rather than a treaty is involved. Cf. ante, at 10. The primacy of the Indian canon over the taxation principle should not be surprising, as this Court has also held that the general presumption supporting the legality of executive action must yield to the Indian canon, a \"counterpresumption specific\" to Indians. Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians, 526 U.S. 172, 194, n. 5 (1999).~    ~    ~      48~      This Court has failed to apply the Indian canon to extend tax exemptions to the Nations only when nothing in the language of the underlying statute or treaty suggests the Nations should be exempted. The Cherokee Tobacco, 11 Wall. 616, 618, 620 (1871) (finding no exemption for the Nations from language imposing taxes on certain \" 'articles produced anywhere within the exterior boundaries of the United States' \"); Choteau v. Burnet, 283 U.S. 691, 693-694 (1931) (finding no exemption in provisions \"subject[ing] the income of 'every individual' to tax,\" including \"income 'from any source whatever' \"); Superintendent of Five Civilized Tribes v. Commissioner, 295 U.S. 418 (1935) (same); Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U.S. 145, 155 (1973) (refusing to exempt the Nations from taxes on land use income based on language that \"[o]n its face ... exempts land and rights in land, not income derived from its use\"). Mescalero also went further, suggesting that because of the taxation principle, the Court would refuse to find such an exemption absent \"clear statutory guidance.\" Id., at 156. Mescalero's formulation is admittedly in tension with the Court's precedents giving the Indian canon primacy over the taxation principle where statutory language is ambiguous. As Mescalero was decided on the same day as one of those very precedents, the unanimous decision in McClanahan v. Arizona Tax Comm'n, supra, however, it cannot have intended to alter the Court's established practice.~    ~    ~      49~      Section 2719(d) provides an even more persuasive case for application of the Indian canon than any of our precedents. Here, the Court is not being asked to create out of vague language a tax exemption not specifically provided for in the statute. Instead, the Nations simply ask the Court to use the Indian canon as a tiebreaker between two equally plausible (or, in this case, equally implausible) constructions of a troubled statute, one which specifically makes chapter 35's tax exemption applicable to the Nations, and one which specifically does not. Breaking interpretive ties is one of the least controversial uses of any canon of statutory construction. See Eskridge, Frickey,  Garrett, Legislation and Statutory Interpretation, at 341 (\"The weakest kind of substantive canon operates merely as a tiebreaker at the end of the interpretive analysis\").~    ~    ~      50~      Faced with the unhappy choice of determining which part of a flawed statutory section is in error, I would thus rely upon the long-established Indian canon of construction and adopt the reading most favorable to the Nations.~    ~    ",

Subsequently, a sheriff's detective, with reasonable suspicion, searched Knights's apartment.

In granting Knights's motion to suppress, the District Court held that, although the detective had \"reasonable suspicion\" to believe that Knights was involved with incendiary materials, the search was for \"investigatory\" rather than \"probationary\" purposes. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.~      Held: The warrantless search of Knights, supported by reasonable suspicion and authorized by a probation condition, satisfied the Fourth Amendment. As nothing in Knights's probation condition limits searches to those with a \"probationary\" purpose, the question here is whether the Fourth Amendment imposes such a limitation. Knights argues that a warrantless search of a probationer satisfies the Fourth Amendment only if it is just like the search at issue in Griffin v. Wisconsin, 483 U.S. 868, i.e., a \"special needs\" search conducted by a probation officer monitoring whether the probationer is complying with probation restrictions. This dubious logic that an opinion upholding the constitutionality of a particular search implicitly holds unconstitutional any search that is not like it runs contrary to Griffin's express statement that its \"special needs\" holding made it \"unnecessary to consider whether\" warrantless searches of probationers were otherwise reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. Id., at 878, 880. And this Court need not decide whether Knights's acceptance of the search condition constituted consent to a complete waiver of his Fourth Amendment rights in the sense of Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, because the search here was reasonable under the Court's general Fourth Amendment \"totality of the circumstances\" approach, Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U.S. 33, 39, with the search condition being a salient circumstance. The Fourth Amendment's touchstone is reasonableness, and a search's reasonableness is determined by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual's privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed to promote legitimate governmental interests. Wyoming v. Houghton, 526 U.S. 295, 300. Knights's status as a probationer subject to a search condition informs both sides of that balance. The sentencing judge reasonably concluded that the search condition would further the two primary goals of probation rehabilitation and protecting society from future criminal violations. Knights was unambiguously informed of the search condition. Thus, Knights's reasonable expectation of privacy was significantly diminished. In assessing the governmental interest, it must be remembered that the very assumption of probation is that the probationer is more likely than others to violate the law. Griffin, supra, at 880. The State's interest in apprehending criminal law violators, thereby protecting potential victims, may justifiably focus on probationers in a way that it does not on the ordinary citizen. On balance, no more than reasonable suspicion was required to search this probationer's house. The degree of individualized suspicion required is a determination that a sufficiently high probability of criminal conduct makes the intrusion on the individual's privacy interest reasonable. Although the Fourth Amendment ordinarily requires probable cause, a lesser degree satisfies the Constitution when the balance of governmental and private interests makes such a standard reasonable. See, e.g., Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1. The same circumstances that lead to the conclusion that reasonable suspicion is constitutionally sufficient also render a warrant requirement unnecessary. See Illinois v. McArthur, 531 U.S. 326, 330. Because the Court's holding rests on ordinary Fourth Amendment analysis that considers all the circumstances of a search, there is no basis for examining official purpose. Pp. 4-9.219 F.3d 1138, reversed and remanded.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT~      Rehnquist, C. J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.~      Opinion of the Court~      Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      A California court sentenced respondent Mark James Knights to summary probation for a drug offense. The probation order included the following condition: that Knights would \"[s]ubmit his   person, property, place of residence, vehicle, personal effects, to search at anytime, with or without a search warrant, warrant of arrest or reasonable cause by any probation officer or law enforcement officer.\" Knights signed the probation order, which stated immediately above his signature that \"I HAVE RECEIVED A COPY, READ AND UNDERSTAND THE ABOVE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PROBATION AND AGREE TO ABIDE BY SAME.\" App. 49. In this case, we decide whether a search pursuant to this probation condition, and supported by reasonable suspicion, satisfied the Fourth Amendment.~    ~    ~      2~      Three days after Knights was placed on probation, a Pacific Gas  Electric (PGE;) power transformer and adjacent Pacific Bell telecommunications vault near the Napa County Airport were pried open and set on fire, causing an estimated $1.5 million in damage. Brass padlocks had been removed and a gasoline accelerant had been used to ignite the fire. This incident was the latest in more than 30 recent acts of vandalism against PGE; facilities in Napa County. Suspicion for these acts had long focused on Knights and his friend, Steven Simoneau. The incidents began after PGE; had filed a theft-of-services complaint against Knights and discontinued his electrical service for failure to pay his bill. Detective Todd Hancock of the Napa County Sheriff's Department had noticed that the acts of vandalism coincided with Knights's court appearance dates concerning the theft of PGE; services. And just a week before the arson, a sheriff's deputy had stopped Knights and Simoneau near a PGE; gas line and observed pipes and gasoline in Simoneau's pickup truck.~    ~    ~      3~      After the PGE; arson, a sheriff's deputy drove by Knights's residence, where he saw Simoneau's truck parked in front. The deputy felt the hood of the truck. It was warm. Detective Hancock decided to set up surveillance of Knights's apartment. At about 3:10 the next morning, Simoneau exited the apartment carrying three cylindrical items. Detective Hancock believed the items were pipe bombs. Simoneau walked across the street to the bank of the Napa River, and Hancock heard three splashes. Simoneau returned without the cylinders and drove away in his truck. Simoneau then stopped in a driveway, parked, and left the area. Detective Hancock entered the driveway and observed a number of suspicious objects in the truck: a Molotov cocktail and explosive materials, a gasoline can, and two brass padlocks that fit the description of those removed from the PGE; transformer vault.~    ~    ~      4~      After viewing the objects in Simoneau's truck, Detective Hancock decided to conduct a search of Knights's apartment. Detective Hancock was aware of the search condition in Knights's probation order and thus believed that a warrant was not necessary.1  The search revealed a detonation cord, ammunition, liquid chemicals, instruction manuals on chemistry and electrical circuitry, bolt cutters, telephone pole-climbing spurs, drug paraphernalia, and a brass padlock stamped \"PGE;.\"~    ~    ~      5~      Knights was arrested, and a federal grand jury subsequently indicted him for conspiracy to commit arson, for possession of an unregistered destructive device, and being a felon in possession of ammunition. Knights moved to suppress the evidence obtained during the search of his apartment. The District Court held that Detective Hancock had \"reasonable suspicion\" to believe that Knights was involved with incendiary materials. App. to Pet. for Cert. 30a. The District Court nonetheless granted the motion to suppress on the ground that the search was for \"investigatory\" rather than \"probationary\" purposes. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 219 F.3d 1138 (2000). The Court of Appeals relied on its earlier decisions holding that the search condition in Knights's probation order \"must be seen as limited to probation searches, and must stop short of investigation searches.\" Id., at 1142 (citing United States v. Ooley, 116 F.3d 370, 371 (CA9 1997)).~    ~    ~      6~      The Supreme Court of California has rejected this distinction and upheld searches pursuant to the California probation condition \"whether the purpose of the search is to monitor the probationer or to serve some other law enforcement purpose.\" People v. Woods, 21 Cal. 4th 668, 681, 981 P.2d 1019, 1027 (1999), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1023 (2000). We granted certiorari, 532 U.S. 1018 (2001), to assess the constitutionality of searches made pursuant to this common California probation condition.~    ~    ~      7~      Certainly nothing in the condition of probation suggests that it was confined to searches bearing upon probationary status and nothing more. The search condition provides that Knights will submit to a search \"by any probation officer or law enforcement officer\" and does not mention anything about purpose. App. 49. The question then is whether the Fourth Amendment limits searches pursuant to this probation condition to those with a \"probationary\" purpose.~    ~    ~      8~      Knights argues that this limitation follows from our decision in Griffin v. Wisconsin, 483 U.S. 868 (1987). Brief for Respondent 14. In Griffin, we upheld a search of a probationer conducted pursuant to a Wisconsin regulation permitting \"any probation officer to search a probationer's home without a warrant as long as his supervisor approves and as long as there are 'reasonable grounds' to believe the presence of contraband,\" 483 U.S., at 870, 871. The Wisconsin regulation that authorized the search was not an express condition of Griffin's probation; in fact, the regulation was not even promulgated at the time of Griffin's sentence.2 The regulation applied to all Wisconsin probationers, with no need for a judge to make an individualized determination that the probationer's conviction justified the need for warrantless searches. We held that a State's operation of its probation system presented a \"special need\" for the \"exercise of supervision to assure that [probation] restrictions are in fact observed.\" Id., at 875. That special need for supervision justified the Wisconsin regulation and the search pursuant to the regulation was thus reasonable. Id., at 875-880.~    ~    ~      9~      In Knights's view, apparently shared by the Court of Appeals, a warrantless search of a probationer satisfies the Fourth Amendment only if it is just like the search at issue in Griffin i.e., a \"special needs\" search conducted by a probation officer monitoring whether the probationer is complying with probation restrictions. This dubious logic that an opinion upholding the constitutionality of a particular search implicitly holds unconstitutional any search that is not like it runs contrary to Griffin's express statement that its \"special needs\" holding made it \"unnecessary to consider whether\" warrantless searches of probationers were otherwise reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.3 Id., at 878, 880.~    ~    ~      10~      We now consider that question in assessing the constitutionality of the search of Knights's apartment. The Government, advocating the approach of the Supreme Court of California, see Woods, supra, contends that the search satisfied the Fourth Amendment under the \"consent\" rationale of cases such as Zap v. United States, 328 U.S. 624 (1946), and Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218 (1973). In the Government's view, Knights's acceptance of the search condition was voluntary because he had the option of rejecting probation and going to prison instead, which the Government argues is analogous to the voluntary decision defendants often make to waive their right to a trial and accept a plea bargain.4~    ~    ~      11~      We need not decide whether Knights's acceptance of the search condition constituted consent in the Schneckloth sense of a complete waiver of his Fourth Amendment rights, however, because we conclude that the search of Knights was reasonable under our general Fourth Amendment approach of \"examining the totality of the circumstances,\" Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U.S. 33, 39 (1996), with the probation search condition being a salientcircumstance.~    ~    ~      12~      The touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, and the reasonableness of a search is determined \"by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual's privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.\" Wyoming v. Houghton, 526 U.S. 295, 300 (1999). Knights's status as a probationer subject to a search condition informs both sides of that balance. \"Probation, like incarceration, is 'a form of criminal sanction imposed by a court upon an offender after verdict, finding, or plea of guilty.'\" Griffin, supra, at 874 (quoting G. Killinger, H. Kerper,  P. Cromwell, Probation and Parole in the Criminal Justice System 14 (1976)). Probation is \"one point   on a continuum of possible punishments ranging from solitary confinement in a maximum-security facility to a few hours of mandatory community service.\" 483 U.S., at 874. Inherent in the very nature of probation is that probationers \"do not enjoy 'the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled.' \" Ibid. (quoting Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 480 (1972)). Just as other punishments for criminal convictions curtail an offender's freedoms, a court granting probation may impose reasonable conditions that deprive the offender of some freedoms enjoyed by law-abiding citizens.~    ~    ~      13~      The judge who sentenced Knights to probation determined that it was necessary to condition the probation on Knights's acceptance of the search provision. It was reasonable to conclude that the search condition would further the two primary goals of probation rehabilitation and protecting society from future criminal violations.5 The probation order clearly expressed the search condition and Knights was unambiguously informed of it. The probation condition thus significantly diminished Knights's reasonable expectation of privacy.6~    ~    ~      14~      In assessing the governmental interest side of the balance, it must be remembered that \"the very assumption of the institution of probation\" is that the probationer \"is more likely than the ordinary citizen to violate the law.\" Griffin, 483 U.S., at 880. The recidivism rate of probationers is significantly higher than the general crime rate. See U.S. Dept. of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Recidivism of Felons on Probation, 1986-89, pp. 1, 6 (Feb. 1992) (reporting that 43% of 79,000 felons placed on probation in 17 States were rearrested for a felony within three years while still on probation); U.S. Dept. of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Probation and Parole Violators in State Prison, 1991, p. 3 (Aug. 1995) (stating that in 1991, 23% of state prisoners were probation violators). And probationers have even more of an incentive to conceal their criminal activities and quickly dispose of incriminating evidence than the ordinary criminal because probationers are aware that they may be subject to supervision and face revocation of probation, and possible incarceration, in proceedings in which the trial rights of a jury and proof beyond a reasonable doubt, among other things, do not apply, see Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420, 435, n. 7 (1984) (\"[T]here is no right to a jury trial before probation may be revoked\"); 18 U.S.C.  3583(e).~    ~    ~      15~      The State has a dual concern with a probationer. On the one hand is the hope that he will successfully complete probation and be integrated back into the community. On the other is the concern, quite justified, that he will be more likely to engage in criminal conduct than an ordinary member of the community. The view of the Court of Appeals in this case would require the State to shut its eyes to the latter concern and concentrate only on the former. But we hold that the Fourth Amendment does not put the State to such a choice. Its interest in apprehending violators of the criminal law, thereby protecting potential victims of criminal enterprise, may therefore justifiably focus on probationers in a way that it does not on the ordinary citizen.~    ~    ~      16~      We hold that the balance of these considerations requires no more than reasonable suspicion to conduct a search of this probationer's house. The degree of individualized suspicion required of a search is a determination of when there is a sufficiently high probability that criminal conduct is occurring to make the intrusion on the individual's privacy interest reasonable. See United States v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 418 (1981) (individualized suspicion deals \"with probabilities\"). Although the Fourth Amendment ordinarily requires the degree of probability embodied in the term \"probable cause,\" a lesser degree satisfies the Constitution when the balance of governmental and private interests makes such a standard reasonable. See, e.g., Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968); United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873 (1975). Those interests warrant a lesser than probable-cause standard here. When an officer has reasonable suspicion that a probationer subject to a search condition is engaged in criminal activity, there is enough likelihood that criminal conduct is occurring that an intrusion on the probationer's significantly diminished privacy interests is reasonable.~    ~    ~      17~      The same circumstances that lead us to conclude that reasonable suspicion is constitutionally sufficient also render a warrant requirement unnecessary. See Illinois v. McArthur, 531 U.S. 326, 330 (2001) (noting that general or individual circumstances, including \"diminished expectations of privacy,\" may justify an exception to the warrant requirement).~    ~    ~      18~      Because our holding rests on ordinary Fourth Amendment analysis that considers all the circumstances of a search, there is no basis for examining official purpose. With the limited exception of some special needs and administrative search cases, see Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 32, 45 (2000), \"we have been unwilling to entertain Fourth Amendment challenges based on the actual motivations of individual officers.\" Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 813 (1996).~    ~    ~      19~      The District Court found, and Knights concedes, that the search in this case was supported by reasonable suspicion. We therefore hold that the warrantless search of Knights, supported by reasonable suspicion and authorized by a condition of probation, was reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.~    ~    ~      20~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      21~      Souter, J., filed a concurring opinion.~    ~    ~      ~        Notes~      ~      ~        1~          Hancock had seen a copy of the probation order when he was checking Knights's file in the Sheriff's Department office.~      ~      ~        2~          Griffin was placed on probation in September 1980, 483 U.S., at 870, and the regulation was not promulgated until December 1981, id., at 871.~      ~      ~        3~          The Wisconsin Supreme Court had held in Griffin that \"probation diminishes a probationer's reasonable expectation of privacy so that a probation officer may, consistent with the Fourth Amendment, search a probationer's home without a warrant, and with only 'reasonable grounds' (not probable cause) to believe that contraband is present.\" Id., at 872.~      ~      ~        4~          The Government sees our unconstitutional conditions doctrine as a limitation on what a probationer may validly consent to in a probation order. The Government argues that the search condition is not an unconstitutional condition because waiver of Fourth Amendment rights \"directly furthers the State's interest in the effective administration of its probation system.\" Brief for United States 22.~      ~      ~        5~          Under California law, a probation condition is invalid if it (1) has no relationship to the crime of which defendant was convicted; (2) relates to conduct which in itself is not criminal; and (3) requires or forbids conduct which is not reasonably related to future criminality. People v. Lent, 15 Cal. 3d 481, 485-486, 541 P.2d 545, 548 (1975).~      ~      ~        6~          We do not decide whether the probation condition so diminished, or completely eliminated, Knights's reasonable expectation of privacy (or constituted consent, see supra, at 6) that a search by a law enforcement officer without any individualized suspicion would have satisfied the reasonableness requirement of the Fourth Amendment. The terms of the probation condition permit such a search, but we need not address the constitutionality of a suspicionless search because the search in this case was supported by reasonable suspicion.~      ~    ~    ~      22~      Justice Souter, concurring.~    ~    ~      23~      As this case was originally presented to us, the dispute centered on whether Knights's agreement to the search condition included in his terms of probation covered only those searches with a probation-related purpose, or rather extended to searches with an investigatory or law-enforcement purpose. At that time, the Government argued that Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806 (1996), precluded any enquiry into the motives of the individual officers conducting the search. We now hold that law-enforcement searches of probationers who have been informed of a search condition are permissible upon individualized suspicion of criminal behavior committed during the probationary period, thus removing any issue of the subjective intention of the investigating officers from the case. I would therefore reserve the question whether Whren's holding, that \"[s]ubjective intentions play no role in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis,\" id., at 813, should extend to searches based only upon reasonable suspicion.~    ~    ",

Readers are requested to notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D. C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.J. E. M. AG SUPPLY, INC., dba FARM ADVANTAGE, INC., et al., PETITIONERSv.PIONEER HI-BRED INTERNATIONAL, INC.~    No. 99-1996.~    Supreme Court of the United States~    Argued October 3, 2001Decided December 10, 2001~    ~      Syllabus~      Respondent Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. (Pioneer), holds 17 utility patents issued under 35 U.S.C.  101 that cover the manufacture, use, sale, and offer for sale of its inbred and hybrid corn seed products. Pioneer sells its patented hybrid seeds under a limited label license that allows only the production of grain and/or forage, and prohibits using such seed for propagation or seed multiplication or for the production or development of a hybrid or different seed variety. Petitioner J. E. M. Ag Supply, Inc., doing business as Farm Advantage, Inc., bought patented seeds from Pioneer in bags bearing the license agreement and then resold the bags. Pioneer filed this patent infringement suit against Farm Advantage and distributors and customers of Farm Advantage (collectively Farm Advantage or petitioners). Farm Advantage filed a patent invalidity counterclaim, arguing that sexually reproducing plants, such as Pioneer's corn plants, are not patentable subject matter within 101. Farm Advantage maintained that the Plant Patent Act of 1930 (PPA) and the Plant Variety Protection Act (PVPA) set forth the exclusive statutory means for protecting plant life because these statutes are more specific than 101, and thus each carves out subject matter from 101 for special treatment. The District Court granted Pioneer summary judgment. Relying on this Court's broad construction of 101 in Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303, the District Court held that 101 clearly covers plant life. It also held that in enacting the PPA and the PVPA, Congress neither expressly nor implicitly removed plants from 101's subject matter. In particular, the District Court noted that Congress did not implicitly repeal 101 by passing the more specific PVPA because there was no irreconcilable conflict between the two statutes. The Federal Circuit affirmed.~      Held: Newly developed plant breeds fall within the subject matter of 101, and neither the PPA nor the PVPA limits the scope of 101's coverage. Pp. 421.~      (a) In approaching the question presented here, this Court is mindful that it has already recognized that 101's language is extremely broad and has concluded that living things are patentable under that provision, Chakrabarty, supra, at 308, 313, 315. Since 1985, the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) has had an unbroken practice of conferring utility patents for plants. Nonetheless, petitioners argue that the PPA and the PVPA are the exclusive means of protecting new varieties of plants, and so awarding utility patents for plants upsets the scheme contemplated by Congress. Pp. 46.~      (b) Neither the PPA's original nor its recodified text indicates that its protection for asexually reproduced plants was intended to be exclusive. The 1930 PPA amended the general patent provision to protect only the asexual reproduction of a plant. And Congress' 1952 revision, which placed plant patents into a separate chapter 15, was only a housekeeping measure that did not change the substantive rights or the relaxed requirements for such patents. Plant patents under the PPA thus continue to have very limited coverage and less stringent requirements than 101 utility patents. Importantly, chapter 15 nowhere states that plant patents are the exclusive means of granting intellectual property protection to plants. The arguments that petitioners advance for why the PPA should preclude assigning utility patents for plants are unpersuasive because petitioners fail to take account of the forward-looking perspective of the utility patent statute and the reality of plant breeding in 1930. Pp. 613.~      (c) That the PVPA specifically authorizes limited patent-like protection for certain sexually reproduced plants does not evidence Congress' intent to deny broader 101 utility patent protection for such plants. While the PVPA creates a comprehensive statutory scheme with respect to its particular protections and subject matter, giving limited protection to plant varieties that are new, distinct, uniform, and stable, nowhere does it restrict the scope of patentable subject matter under 101. The PVPA contains no statement of exclusivity. Furthermore, at the time the PVPA was enacted, the PTO had already issued numerous utility patents for hybrid plant processes, which reaffirms that such material was within 101's scope. Petitioners also err in arguing that the PVPA altered 101's subject-matter coverage by implication. Repeal by implication requires that the earlier and later statutes be irreconcilable, Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 550. The differences in the requirements for, and coverage of, utility patents and PVPA plant variety certificates, however, do not present irreconcilable conflicts because the requirements for a 101 utility patent are more stringent than those for a PVP certificate, and the protections afforded by a utility patent are greater than those afforded by a PVP certificate. Petitioners' suggestion that dual protection cannot exist when statutes overlap and purport to protect the same commercially valuable attribute or thing is rejected as well. This Court has given effect to two overlapping statutes, so long as each reaches some distinct cases, see Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 253, and it has allowed dual protection in other intellectual property cases, see, e.g., Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., 416 U.S. 470, 484. In this case, many plant varieties that are unable to satisfy 101's stringent requirements might still qualify for the PVPA's lesser protections. Pp. 1320.~      (d) The PTO has assigned utility patents for plants for at least 16 years, and there has been no indication from either Congress or agencies with expertise that such coverage is inconsistent with the PVPA or the PPA. Congress has not only failed to pass legislation indicating that it disagrees with the PTO's interpretation of 101; it has even recognized the availability of utility patents for plants. P. 20.200 F.3d 1374, affirmed.~      ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT~      Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, and Ginsburg, JJ., joined.~      Opinion of the Court~      Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      1~      This case presents the question whether utility patents may be issued for plants under 35 U.S.C.  101 (1994 ed.), or whether the Plant Variety Protection Act, 84 Stat. 1542, as amended, 7 U.S.C.  2321 et seq., and the Plant Patent Act of 1930, 35 U.S.C.  161-164 (1994 ed. and Supp. V), are the exclusive means of obtaining a federal statutory right to exclude others from reproducing, selling, or using plants or plant varieties. We hold that utility patents may be issued for plants. I~    ~    ~      2~      The United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) has issued some 1,800 utility patents for plants, plant parts, and seeds pursuant to 35 U.S.C.  101. Seventeen of these patents are held by respondent Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. (Pioneer). Pioneer's patents cover the manufacture, use, sale, and offer for sale of the company's inbred and hybrid corn seed products. A patent for an inbred corn line protects both the seeds and plants of the inbred line and the hybrids produced by crossing the protected inbred line with another corn line. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,506,367, col. 3, App. 42. A hybrid plant patent protects the plant, its seeds, variants, mutants, and trivial modifications of the hybrid. See U.S. Patent No. 5,491,295, cols. 2-3, id., at 29-30.~    ~    ~      3~      Pedigree inbred corn plants are developed by crossing corn plants with desirable characteristics and then inbreeding the resulting plants for several generations until the resulting plant line is homogenous. Inbreds are often weak and have a low yield; their value lies primarily in their use for making hybrids. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,506,367, col. 6, id., at 43 (describing the traits and applications of the inbred corn line PHP38 by reference to the qualities exhibited in hybrid plants created with PHP38).~    ~    ~      4~      Hybrid seeds are produced by crossing two inbred corn plants and are especially valuable because they produce strong and vibrant hybrid plants with selected highly desirable characteristics. For instance, Pioneer's hybrid corn plant 3394 is \"characterized by superior yield for maturity, excellent seedling vigor, very good roots and stalks, and exceptional stay green.\" U.S. Patent No. 5,491,295, cols. 2-3, id., at 29-30. Hybrid plants, however, generally do not reproduce true-to-type, i.e., seeds produced by a hybrid plant do not reliably yield plants with the same hybrid characteristics. Thus, a farmer who wishes to continue growing hybrid plants generally needs to buy more hybrid seed.~    ~    ~      5~      Pioneer sells its patented hybrid seeds under a limited label license that provides: \"License is granted solely to produce grain and/or forage.\" Id., at 51. The license \"does not extend to the use of seed from such crop or the progeny thereof for propagation or seed multiplication.\" Ibid. It strictly prohibits \"the use of such seed or the progeny thereof for propagation or seed multiplication or for production or development of a hybrid or different variety of seed.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      6~      Petitioner J. E. M. Ag Supply, Inc., doing business as Farm Advantage, Inc., purchased patented hybrid seeds from Pioneer in bags bearing this license agreement. Although not a licensed sales representative of Pioneer, Farm Advantage resold these bags. Pioneer subsequently brought a complaint for patent infringement against Farm Advantage and several other corporations and residents of the State of Iowa who are distributors and customers for Farm Advantage (referred to collectively as Farm Advantage or petitioners). Pioneer alleged that Farm Advantage has \"for a long-time past been and still [is] infringing one or more [Pioneer patents] by making, using, selling, or offering for sale corn seed of the   hybrids in infringement of these patents-in-suit.\" Id., at 10.~    ~    ~      7~      Farm Advantage answered with a general denial of patent infringement and entered a counterclaim of patent invalidity, arguing that patents that purport to confer protection for corn plants are invalid because sexually reproducing plants are not patentable subject matter within the scope of 35 U.S.C.  101 (1994 ed.). App. 12-13, 17.    Farm Advantage maintained that the Plant Patent Act of 1930 (PPA) and the Plant Variety Protection Act (PVPA) set forth the exclusive statutory means for the protection of plant life because these statutes are more specific than 101, and thus each carves out subject matter from 101 for special treatment.1~    ~    ~      8~      The District Court granted summary judgment to Pioneer. Relying on this Court's broad construction of 101 in Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303 (1980), the District Court held that the subject matter covered by 101 clearly includes plant life. 49 USPQ 2d 1813, 1817 (ND Iowa 1998). It further concluded that in enacting the PPA and the PVPA Congress neither expressly nor implicitly removed plants from 101's subject matter. Id., at 1819. In particular, the District Court noted that Congress did not implicitly repeal 101 by passing the more specific PVPA because there was no irreconcilable conflict between the PVPA and 101. Id., at 1821.~    ~    ~      9~      The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the judgment and reasoning of the District Court. 200 F.3d 1374 (2000). We granted certiorari, 531 U.S. 1143 (2001), and now affirm.~    ~    II~    ~      10~      The question before us is whether utility patents may be issued for plants pursuant to 35 U.S.C.  101 (1994 ed.). The text of 101 provides:~    ~    ~      11~      \"Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.\"~    ~    ~      12~      As this Court recognized over 20 years ago in Chakrabarty, 447 U.S., at 308, the language of 101 is extremely broad. \"In choosing such expansive terms as 'manufacture' and 'composition of matter,' modified by the comprehensive 'any,' Congress plainly contemplated that the patent laws would be given wide scope.\" Ibid. This Court thus concluded in Chakrabarty that living things were patentable under 101, and held that a manmade micro-organism fell within the scope of the statute. As Congress recognized, \"the relevant distinction was not between living and inanimate things, but between products of nature, whether living or not, and human-made inventions.\" Id., at 313.~    ~    ~      13~      In Chakrabarty, the Court also rejected the argument that Congress must expressly authorize protection for new patentable subject matter:~    ~    ~      14~      \"It is, of course, correct that Congress, not the courts, must define the limits of patentability; but it is equally true that once Congress has spoken it is 'the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.' Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803). Congress has performed its constitutional role in defining patentable subject matter in 101; we perform ours in construing the language Congress has employed. . . . The subject-matter provisions of the patent law have been cast in broad terms to fulfill the constitutional and statutory goal of promoting 'the Progress of Science and the useful Arts' with all that means for the social and economic benefits envisioned by Jefferson.\" Id., at 315.~    ~    ~      15~      Thus, in approaching the question presented by this case, we are mindful that this Court has already spoken clearly concerning the broad scope and applicability of 101.2~    ~    ~      16~      Several years after Chakrabarty, the PTO Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences held that plants were within the understood meaning of \"manufacture\" or \"composition of matter\" and therefore were within the subject matter of 101. In re Hibberd, 227 USPQ 443, 444 (1985). It has been the unbroken practice of the PTO since that time to confer utility patents for plants. To obtain utility patent protection, a plant breeder must show that the plant he has developed is new, useful, and non-obvious. 35 U.S.C.  101-103 (1994 ed. and Supp. V). In addition, the plant must meet the specifications of 112, which require a written description of the plant and a deposit of seed that is publicly accessible. See 37 CFR 1.801-1.809 (2001).~    ~    ~      17~      Petitioners do not allege that Pioneer's patents are invalid for failure to meet the requirements for a utility patent. Nor do they dispute that plants otherwise fall within the terms of 101's broad language that includes \"manufacture\" or \"composition of matter.\" Rather, petitioners argue that the PPA and the PVPA provide the exclusive means of protecting new varieties of plants, and so awarding utility patents for plants upsets the scheme contemplated by Congress. Brief for Petitioners 11. We disagree. Considering the two plant specific statutes in turn, we find that neither forecloses utility patent coverage for plants.~    ~    ~      18~      * The 1930 PPA conferred patent protection to asexually reproduced plants. Significantly, nothing within either the original 1930 text of the statute or its recodified version in 1952 indicates that the PPA's protection for asexually reproduced plants was intended to be exclusive.~    ~    ~      19~      Plants were first explicitly brought within the scope of patent protection in 1930 when the PPA included \"plants\" among the useful things subject to patents. Thus the 1930 PPA amended the general utility patent provision, Rev. Stat. 4886, to provide:~    ~    ~      20~      \"Any person who has invented or discovered any new and useful art, machine, manufacture or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvements thereof, or who has invented or discovered and asexually reproduced any distinct and new variety of plant, other than a tuber-propagated plant, not known or used by others in this country, before his invention or discovery thereof,   may   obtain a patent therefor.\" Act of May 23, 1930, 1, 46 Stat. 376.~    ~    ~      21~      This provision limited protection to the asexual reproduction of the plant. Asexual reproduction occurs by grafting, budding, or the like, and produces an offspring with a genetic combination identical to that of the single parent essentially a clone.3 The PPA also amended Revised Statutes 4888 by adding, \"No plant patent shall be declared invalid on the ground of noncompliance with this section if the description is made as complete as is reasonably possible.\" Id., 2, 46 Stat. 376.~    ~    ~      22~      In 1952, Congress revised the patent statute and placed the plant patents into a separate chapter 15 of Title 35 entitled, \"Patents for plants.\" 35 U.S.C.  161-164.4 This was merely a housekeeping measure that did nothing to change the substantive rights or requirements for a plant patent. A \"plant patent\"5 continued to provide only the exclusive right to asexually reproduce a protected plant, 163, and the description requirement remained relaxed, 162.6 Plant patents under the PPA thus have very limited coverage and less stringent requirements than 101 utility patents.~    ~    ~      23~      Importantly, chapter 15 nowhere states that plant patents are the exclusive means of granting intellectual property protection to plants. Although unable to point to any language that requires, or even suggests, that Congress intended the PPA's protections to be exclusive, petitioners advance three reasons why the PPA should preclude assigning utility patents for plants. We find none of these arguments to be persuasive.~    ~    ~      24~      First, petitioners argue that plants were not covered by the general utility patent statute prior to 1930. Brief for Petitioners 19 (\"If the patent laws before 1930 allowed patents on 'plants' then there would have been no reason for Congress to have passed the 1930 PPA  \"). In advancing this argument, petitioners overlook the state of patent law and plant breeding at the time of the PPA's enactment. The Court in Chakrabarty explained the realities of patent law and plant breeding at the time the PPA was enacted: \"Prior to 1930, two factors were thought to remove plants from patent protection. The first was the belief that plants, even those artificially bred, were products of nature for purposes of the patent law.   The second obstacle to patent protection for plants was the fact that plants were thought not amenable to the 'written description' requirement of the patent law.\" 447 U.S., at 311-312. Congress addressed these concerns with the 1930 PPA, which recognized that the work of a plant breeder was a patentable invention and relaxed the written description requirement. See 1-2, 46 Stat. 376. The PPA thus gave patent protection to breeders who were previously unable to overcome the obstacles described in Chakrabarty.~    ~    ~      25~      This does not mean, however, that prior to 1930 plants could not have fallen within the subject matter of 101. Rather, it illustrates only that in 1930 Congress believed that plants were not patentable under 101, both because they were living things and because in practice they could not meet the stringent description requirement. Yet these premises were disproved over time. As this Court held in Chakrabarty, \"the relevant distinction\" for purposes of 101 is not \"between living and inanimate things, but between products of nature, whether living or not, and human-made inventions.\" 447 U.S., at 313. In addition, advances in biological knowledge and breeding expertise have allowed plant breeders to satisfy 101's demanding description requirement.~    ~    ~      26~      Whatever Congress may have believed about the state of patent law and the science of plant breeding in 1930, plants have always had the potential to fall within the general subject matter of 101, which is a dynamic provision designed to encompass new and unforeseen inventions. \"A rule that unanticipated inventions are without protection would conflict with the core concept of the patent law that anticipation undermines patentability.\" Id., at 316.~    ~    ~      27~      Petitioners essentially ask us to deny utility patent protection for sexually reproduced plants because it was unforeseen in 1930 that such plants could receive protection under 101. Denying patent protection under 101 simply because such coverage was thought technologically infeasible in 1930, however, would be inconsistent with the forward-looking perspective of the utility patent statute. As we noted in Chakrabarty, \"Congress employed broad general language in drafting 101 precisely because [new types of] inventions are often unforeseeable.\" Ibid.~    ~    ~      28~      Second, petitioners maintain that the PPA's limitation to asexually reproduced plants would make no sense if Congress intended 101 to authorize patents on plant varieties that were sexually reproduced. But this limitation once again merely reflects the reality of plant breeding in 1930. At that time, the primary means of reproducing bred plants true-to-type was through asexual reproduction. Congress thought that sexual reproduction through seeds was not a stable way to maintain desirable bred characteristics.7 Thus, it is hardly surprising that plant patents would protect only asexual reproduction, since this was the most reliable type of reproduction for preserving the desirable characteristics of breeding. See generally E. Sinnott, Botany Principles and Problems 266-267 (1935); J. Priestley  L. Scott, Introduction to Botany 530 (1938).~    ~    ~      29~      Furthermore, like other laws protecting intellectual property, the plant patent provision must be understood in its proper context. Until 1924, farmers received seed from the Government's extensive free seed program that distributed millions of packages of seed annually. See Fowler, The Plant Patent Act of 1930: A Sociological History of its Creation, 82 J. Pat.  Tm. Off. Soc. 621, 623, 632 (2000).8 In 1930, seed companies were not primarily concerned with varietal protection, but were still trying to successfully commodify seeds. There was no need to protect seed breeding because there were few markets for seeds. See Kloppenburg 71 (\"Seed companies' first priority was simply to establish a market, and they continuedto view the congressional distribution as a principal  constraint\").~    ~    ~      30~      By contrast, nurseries at the time had successfully commercialized asexually reproduced fruit trees and flowers. These plants were regularly copied, draining profits from those who discovered or bred new varieties. Nurseries were the primary subjects of agricultural marketing and so it is not surprising that they were the specific focus of the PPA. See Fowler, supra, at 634-635; Kneen, Patent Plants Enrich Our World, National Geographic 357, 363 (1948).~    ~    ~      31~      Moreover, seed companies at the time could not point to genuinely new varieties and lacked the scientific knowledge to engage in formal breeding that would increase agricultural productivity. See Kloppenburg 77; Fowler, supra, at 633 (\"Absent significant numbers of distinct new varieties being produced by seed companies, variety protection through something like a patent law would hardly have been considered a business necessity\"). In short, there is simply no evidence, let alone the overwhelming evidence needed to establish repeal by implication, see Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Epstein, 516 U.S. 367, 381 (1996), that Congress, by specifically protecting asexually reproduced plants through the PPA, intended to preclude utility patent protection for sexually reproduced plants.9~    ~    ~      32~      Third, petitioners argue that in 1952 Congress would not have moved plants out of the utility patent provision and into 161 if it had intended 101 to allow for protection of plants. Brief for Petitioners 20. Petitioners again rely on negative inference because they cannot point to any express indication that Congress intended 161 to be the exclusive means of patenting plants. But this negative inference simply does not support carving out subject matter that otherwise fits comfortably within the expansive language of 101, especially when 101 can protect different attributes and has more stringent requirements than does 161.~    ~    ~      33~      This is especially true given that Congress in 1952 did nothing to change the substantive rights or requirements for obtaining a plant patent. Absent a clear intent to the contrary, we are loath to interpret what was essentially a housekeeping measure as an affirmative decision by Congress to deny sexually reproduced plants patent protection under 101.~    ~    B~    ~      34~      By passing the PVPA in 1970, Congress specifically authorized limited patent-like protection for certain sexually reproduced plants. Petitioners therefore argue that this legislation evidences Congress' intent to deny broader 101 utility patent protection for such plants. Petitioners' argument, however, is unavailing for two reasons. First, nowhere does the PVPA purport to provide the exclusive statutory means of protecting sexually reproduced plants. Second, the PVPA and 101 can easily be reconciled. Because it is harder to qualify for a utility patent than for a Plant Variety Protection (PVP) certificate, it only makes sense that utility patents would confer a greater scope of protection.~    ~    ~      35~      * The PVPA provides plant variety protection for:~    ~    ~      36~      \"The breeder of any sexually reproduced or tuber propagated plant variety (other than fungi or bacteria) who has so reproduced the variety   .\" 7 U.S.C.  2402(a).~    ~    ~      37~      Infringement of plant variety protection occurs, inter alia, if someone sells or markets the protected variety, sexually multiplies the variety as a step in marketing, uses the variety in producing a hybrid, or dispenses the variety without notice that the variety is protected.10~    ~    ~      38~      Since the 1994 amendments, the PVPA also protects \"any variety that is essentially derived from a protected variety,\" 2541(c)(1), and \"any variety whose production requires the repeated use of a protected variety,\" 2541(c)(3). See Plant Variety Protection Act Amendments of 1994, 9, 108 Stat. 3142. Practically, this means that hybrids created from protected plant varieties are also protected; however, it is not infringement to use a protected variety for the development of a hybrid. See 7 U.S.C.  2541(a)(4).11~    ~    ~      39~      The PVPA also contains exemptions for saving seed and for research. A farmer who legally purchases and plants a protected variety can save the seed from these plants for replanting on his own farm. See 2543 (\"[I]t shall not infringe any right hereunder for a person to save seed produced by the person from seed obtained, or descended from seed obtained, by authority of the owner of the variety for seeding purposes and use such saved seed in the production of a crop for use on the farm of the person  \"); see also Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U.S. 179 (1995). In addition, a protected variety may be used for research. See 7 U.S.C.  2544 (\"The use and reproduction of a protected variety for plant breeding or other bona fide research shall not constitute an infringement of the protection provided under this chapter\"). The utility patent statute does not contain similar exemptions.12~    ~    ~      40~      Thus, while the PVPA creates a statutory scheme that is comprehensive with respect to its particular protections and subject matter, giving limited protection to plant varieties that are new, distinct, uniform, and stable, 2402(a), nowhere does it restrict the scope of patentable subject matter under 101. With nothing in the statute to bolster their view that the PVPA provides the exclusive means for protecting sexually reproducing plants, petitioners rely on the legislative history of the PVPA. They argue that this history shows the PVPA was enacted because sexually reproducing plant varieties and their seeds were not and had never been intended by Congress to be included within the classes of things patentable under Title 35.13~    ~    ~      41~      The PVPA itself, however, contains no statement that plant variety certificates were to be the exclusive means of protecting sexually reproducing plants. The relevant statements in the legislative history reveal nothing more than the limited view of plant breeding taken by some Members of Congress who believed that patent protection was unavailable for sexually reproduced plants. This view stems from a lack of awareness concerning scientificpossibilities.~    ~    ~      42~      Furthermore, at the time the PVPA was enacted, the PTO had already issued numerous utility patents for hybrid plant processes. Many of these patents, especially since the 1950's, included claims on the products of the patented process, i.e., the hybrid plant itself. See Kloppenburg 264. Such plants were protected as part of a hybrid process and not on their own. Nonetheless, these hybrids still enjoyed protection under 101, which reaffirms that such material was within the scope of 101.~    ~    2~    ~      43~      Petitioners next argue that the PVPA altered the subject-matter coverage of 101 by implication. Brief for Petitioners 33-36. Yet \"the only permissible justification for a repeal by implication is when the earlier and later statutes are irreconcilable.\" Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 550 (1974). \"The rarity with which [the Court has] discovered implied repeals is due to the relatively stringent standard for such findings, namely, that there be an irreconcilable conflict between the two federal statutes at issue.\" Matsushita, 516 U.S., at 381 (internal quotation marks omitted).~    ~    ~      44~      To be sure, there are differences in the requirements for, and coverage of, utility patents and plant variety certificates issued pursuant to the PVPA. These differences, however, do not present irreconcilable conflicts because the requirements for obtaining a utility patent under 101 are more stringent than those for obtaining a PVP certificate, and the protections afforded by a utility patent are greater than those afforded by a PVP certificate. Thus, there is a parallel relationship between the obligations and the level of protection under each statute.~    ~    ~      45~      It is much more difficult to obtain a utility patent for a plant than to obtain a plant variety certificate because a utility patentable plant must be new, useful, and nonobvious, 35 U.S.C.  101-103. In addition, to obtain a utility patent, a breeder must describe the plant with sufficient specificity to enable others to \"make and use\" the invention after the patent term expires. 112. The disclosure required by the Patent Act is \"the quid pro quo of the right to exclude.\" Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., 416 U.S. 470, 484 (1974). The description requirement for plants includes a deposit of biological material, for example seeds, and mandates that such material be accessible to the public. See 37 CFR 1.801-1.809 (2001); see also App. 39 (seed deposits for U.S. Patent No. 5,491,295).~    ~    ~      46~      By contrast, a plant variety may receive a PVP certificate without a showing of usefulness or nonobviousness. See 7 U.S.C.  2402(a) (requiring that the variety be only new, distinct, uniform, and stable). Nor does the PVPA require a description and disclosure as extensive as those required under 101. The PVPA requires a \"description of the variety setting forth its distinctiveness, uniformity and stability and a description of the genealogy and breeding procedure, when known.\" 7 U.S.C.  2422(2). It also requires a deposit of seed in a public depository, 2422(4), but neither the statute nor the applicable regulation mandates that such material be accessible to the general public during the term of the PVP certificate. See 7 CFR  97.6 (2001).~    ~    ~      47~      Because of the more stringent requirements, utility patent holders receive greater rights of exclusion than holders of a PVP certificate. Most notably, there are no exemptions for research or saving seed under a utility patent. Additionally, although Congress increased the level of protection under the PVPA in 1994, a plant variety certificate still does not grant the full range of protections afforded by a utility patent. For instance, a utility patent on an inbred plant line protects that line as well as all hybrids produced by crossing that inbred with another plant line. Similarly, the PVPA now protects \"any variety whose production requires the repeated use of a protected variety.\" 7 U.S.C.  2541(c)(3). Thus, one cannot use a protected plant variety to produce a hybrid for commercial sale. PVPA protection still falls short of a utility patent, however, because a breeder can use a plant that is protected by a PVP certificate to \"develop\" a new inbred line while he cannot use a plant patented under 101 for such a purpose. See 7 U.S.C.  2541(a)(4) (infringement includes \"use [of] the variety in producing (as distinguished from developing) a hybrid or different variety therefrom\"). See also H. R. Rep. No. 91-1605, p. 11 (1970); 1 D. Chisum, Patents 1.05[2][d][i], p. 549 (2001).~    ~    ~      48~      For all of these reasons, it is clear that there is no \"positive repugnancy\" between the issuance of utility patents for plants and PVP coverage for plants. Radzanower v. Touche Ross  Co., 426 U.S. 148, 155 (1976). Nor can it be said that the two statutes \"cannot mutually coexist.\" Ibid. Indeed, \"when two statutes are capable of coexistence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective.\" Morton, 417 U.S., at 551. Here we can plainly regard each statute as effective because of its different requirements and protections. The plain meaning of 101, as interpreted by this Court in Chakrabarty, clearly includes plants within its subject matter. The PPA and the PVPA are not to the contrary and can be read alongside 101 in protecting plants.~    ~    3~    ~      49~      Petitioners also suggest that even when statutes overlap and purport to protect the same commercially valuable attribute of a thing, such \"dual protection\" cannot exist. Brief for Petitioners 44-45. Yet this Court has not hesitated to give effect to two statutes that overlap, so long as each reaches some distinct cases. See Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 253 (1992) (statutes that overlap \"do not pose an either-or proposition\" where each confers jurisdiction over cases that the other does not reach). Here, while utility patents and PVP certificates do contain some similar protections, as discussed above, the overlap is only partial.~    ~    ~      50~      Moreover, this Court has allowed dual protection in other intellectual property cases. \"Certainly the patent policy of encouraging invention is not disturbed by the existence of another form of incentive to invention. In this respect the two systems [trade secret protection and patents] are not and never would be in conflict.\" Kewanee Oil, 416 U.S., at 484; see also Mazer v. Stein, 347 U.S. 201, 217 (1954) (the patentability of an object does not preclude the copyright of that object as a work of art). In this case, many plant varieties that are unable to satisfy the stringent requirements of 101 might still qualify for the lesser protections afforded by the PVPA.~    ~    III~    ~      51~      We also note that the PTO has assigned utility patents for plants for at least 16 years and there has been no indication from either Congress or agencies with expertise that such coverage is inconsistent with the PVPA or the PPA. The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, which has specific expertise in issues of patent law, relied heavily on this Court's decision in Chakrabarty when it interpreted the subject matter of 101 to include plants. In re Hibberd, 227 USPQ 443 (1985). This highly visible decision has led to the issuance of some 1,800 utility patents for plants. Moreover, the PTO, which administers 101 as well as the PPA, recognizes and regularly issues utility patents for plants. In addition, the Department of Agriculture's Plant Variety Protection Office acknowledges the existence of utility patents for plants.~    ~    ~      52~      In the face of these developments, Congress has not only failed to pass legislation indicating that it disagrees with the PTO's interpretation of 101, it has even recognized the availability of utility patents for plants. In a 1999 amendment to 35 U.S.C.  119 which concerns the right of priority for patent rights, Congress provided: \"Applications for plant breeder's rights filed in a WTO [World Trade Organization] member country   shall have the same effect for the purpose of the right of priority   as applications for patents, subject to the same conditions and requirements of this section as apply to applications for patents.\" 35 U.S.C.  119(f) (1994 ed., Supp. V). Crucially, 119(f) is part of the general provisions of Title 35, not the specific chapter of the PPA, which suggests a recognition on the part of Congress that plants are patentable under 101.~    ~    IV~    ~      53~      For these reasons, we hold that newly developed plant breeds fall within the terms of 101, and that neither the PPA nor the PVPA limits the scope of 101's coverage. As in Chakrabarty, we decline to narrow the reach of 101 where Congress has given us no indication that it intends this result. 447 U.S., at 315-316. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.~    ~    ~      54~      It is so ordered.~    ~    ~      55~      Justice O'Connor took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.~    ~    ~      56~      Scalia, J., filed a concurring opinion.~    ~    ~      57~      Breyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Stevens, J., joined.~    ~    ~      58~      O'Connor, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.~    ~    ~      ~        Notes:~      ~      ~        1~          Petitioners favor a holding that the PVPA is the only means of protecting these corn plants primarily because the PVPA's coverage is generally less extensive and the hybrid seeds at issue do not have PVPA protection. App. 14. Most notably, the PVPA provides exemptions for research and for farmers to save seed from their crops for replanting. See, infra, at 14. Utility patents issued for plants do not contain such exemptions.~      ~      ~        2~         Justice Breyer argues that Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303, 315 (1980), cannot determine the outcome of this case because it did not answer the precise question presented. See post, at 1-3 (dissenting opinion). But this simply misses the mark. Chakrabarty broadly interpreted the reach of 101. This interpretation is surely germane to the question whether sexually reproduced plants fall within the subject matter of 101. In addition, Chakrabarty's discussion of the PPA and the PVPA is relevant to petitioners' primary arguments against utility patent protection for sexually reproduced plants. See 447 U.S., at 310-314; see also infra, at 8-9.~      ~      ~        3~          By contrast, sexual reproduction occurs by seed and sometimes involves two different plants.~      ~      ~        4~         The PPA, as amended, provides: \"Whoever invents or discovers and asexually reproduces any distinct and new variety of plant, including cultivated sports, mutants, hybrids, and newly found seedlings, other than a tuber propagated plant or a plant found in an uncultivated state, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.\" 35 U.S.C.  161.~      ~      ~        5~          Patents issued under 161 are referred to as \"plant patents,\" which are distinguished from 101 utility patents and 171 design patents.~      ~      ~        6~         To obtain a plant patent under 161 a breeder must meet all of the requirements for 101, except for the description requirement. See 162 (\"No plant patent shall be declared invalid for noncompliance with section 112 [providing for written description] of this title if the description is as complete as is reasonably possible\").~      ~      ~        7~          The Senate Report accompanying the bill notes: \"All such plants must be asexually reproduced in order to have their identity preserved. This is necessary since seedlings either of chance or self-pollenization from any of these would not preserve the character of the individual.\" S. Rep. No. 315, 71st Cong., 2d Sess., 3 (1930) (hereinafter S. Rep.). This report, like the text, indicates Congress' intent to limit plant patent coverage to asexual reproduction, but explains that this limitation \"recognizes a practical situation\" i.e., that propagation by seeds does not preserve the character of the original. See id., at 4 (\"[T]he patent right granted is a right to propagate the new variety by asexual reproduction. It does not include the right to propagate by seeds. This limitation in the right granted recognizes a practical situation and greatly narrows the scope of the bill\"). The limitation to asexual reproduction was a recognition of the \"practical situation\" that seedlings did not reproduce true-to-type. An exclusive right to asexual reproduction was the only type of coverage needed and thought possible given the state of plant breeding at the time.~      ~      ~        8~          At its high point in 1897, over 20 million packages of seed were distributed to farmers. See N. Klose, America's Crop Heritage 98 (1950). Even at the time the program was eliminated in 1924, it was the third largest line item in the Department of Agriculture's budget. See J. Kloppenburg, First the Seed: The Political Economy of Plant Biotechnology 1492-2000, p. 71 (1988) (hereinafter Kloppenburg).~      ~      ~        9~          The dissent relies on United States v. Estate of Romani, 523 U.S. 517 (1998), for the proposition that \"a later, more specific statute trumps an earlier, more general one.\" See post, at 10. Yet in Estate of Romani this purported rule was applied because the meaning of the earlier statute was \"unresolved.\" 523 U.S., at 530. The Court noted that \"despite the age of the statute, and despite the fact that it has been the subject of a great deal of litigation,\" its meaning had not been definitively established. Id., at 529. By contrast, the statutory terms \"manufacture or composition of matter\" were not similarly unresolved at the time the PPA was passed. In addition, these subject matter terms have been interpreted broadly to evolve with developments in science and technology. See Chakrabarty, 447 U.S., at 315. Moreover, even in Estate of Romani, the Court considered that there was no \"plain inconsistency\" between the earlier and later statutes. 523 U.S., at 533.~      ~      ~        10~          7 U.S.C.  2541(a), which provides in full:     \"(a)  Acts constituting infringement     \"Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, it shall be an infringement of the rights of the owner of a protected variety to perform without authority, any of the following acts in the United States, or in commerce which can be regulated by Congress or affecting such commerce, prior to expiration of the right to plant variety protection but after either the issue of the certificate or the distribution of a protected plant variety with the notice under section 2567 of this title:     \"(1)  sell or market the protected variety, or offer it or expose it for sale, deliver it, ship it, consign it, exchange it, or solicit an offer to buy it, or any other transfer of title or possession of it;     \"(2)  import the variety into, or export it from, the United States;     \"(3)  sexually multiply, or propagate by a tuber or part of a tuber, the variety as a step in marketing (for growing purposes) the variety;     \"(4)  use the variety in producing (as distinguished from developing) a hybrid or different variety therefrom;     \"(5)  use seed which had been marked 'Unauthorized Propagation Prohibited' or 'Unauthorized Seed Multiplication Prohibited' or progeny thereof to propagate the variety;     \"(6)  dispense the variety to another, in a form which can be propagated, without notice as to being a protected variety under which it was received;     \"(7) condition the variety for the purpose of propagation, except to the extent that the conditioning is related to the activities permitted under section 2543 of this title;     \"(8)  stock the variety for any of the purposes referred to in paragraphs (1) through (7);     \"(9)  perform any of the foregoing acts even in instances in which the variety is multiplied other than sexually, except in pursuance of a valid United States plant patent; or     \"(10)  instigate or actively induce performance of any of the foregoing acts.\"~      ~      ~        11~          It is, however, infringement of a utility patent to use a protected plant in the development of another variety. See infra, at 18.~      ~      ~        12~          The dissent argues that our \"reading would destroy\" the PVPA's exemptions. Post, at 9. Yet such bold predictions are belied by the facts. According to the Government, over 5,000 PVP certificates have been issued, as compared to about 1,800 utility patents for plants. Tr. of Oral Arg. 41. Since 1985 the PTO has interpreted 101 to include utility patents for plants and there is no evidence that the availability of such patents has rendered the PVPA and its specific exemptions obsolete.~      ~      ~        13~          Petitioners point to a House Report that concluded:     \"Under patent law, protection is presently limited to those varieties of plants which reproduce asexually, that is, by such methods as grafting or budding. No protection is available to those varieties of plants which reproduce sexually, that is, generally by seeds.\" H. R. Rep. No. 91-1605, p. 1 (1970); Brief for Petitioners 40.~      ~    ~    ~      59~      Justice Scalia, concurring.~    ~    ~      60~      This case presents an interesting and difficult point of statutory construction, seemingly pitting against each other two perfectly valid canons of interpretation: (1) that statutes must be construed in their entirety, so that the meaning of one provision sheds light upon the meaning of another; and (2) that repeals by implication are not favored. I think these sensible canons are reconcilable only if the first of them is limited by the second. That is to say, the power of a provision of law to give meaning to a previously enacted ambiguity comes to an end once the ambiguity has been authoritatively resolved. At that point, use of the later enactment produces not clarification (governed by the first canon) but amendment (governed by thesecond).~    ~    ~      61~      In the present case, the only ambiguity that could have been clarified by the words added to the utility patent statute by the Plant Patent Act of 1930 (PPA) is whether the term \"composition of matter\" included living things. The newly enacted provision for plants invited the conclusion that this term which preceded it did not include living things. (The term \"matter,\" after all, is sometimes used in a sense that excludes living things. See Webster's New International Dictionary 1515 (2d ed. 1950): \"Physical substance as made up of chemical elements and distinguished from incorporeal substance, action, qualities, etc  . ' Matter is inert, senseless, and lifeless.' Johnson.\") It is important to note that this is the only way in which the new PPA language could have clarified the ambiguity: There was no way in which \"composition of matter\" could be regarded as a category separate from plants, but not separate from other living things.~    ~    ~      62~      Stare decisis, however, prevents us from any longer regarding as an open question as ambiguous whether \"composition of matter\" includes living things. Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303, 312-313 (1980), holds that it does. As the case comes before us, therefore, the language of the PPA if it is to have any effect on the outcome must do so by way of amending what we have held to be a statute that covers living things (and hence covers plants). At this point the canon against repeal by implication comes into play, and I agree with the Court that it determines the outcome. I therefore join the opinion of the Court.~    ~    ~      63~      Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens joins, dissenting.~    ~    ~      64~      The question before us is whether the words \"manufacture\" or \"compositions of matter\" contained in the utility patent statute, 35 U.S.C.  101 (1994 ed.) (Utility Patent Statute), cover plants that also fall within the scope of two more specific statutes, the Plant Patent Act of 1930 (PPA), 35 U.S.C.  161 et seq. (1994 ed. and Supp. V), and the Plant Variety Protection Act (PVPA), 7 U.S.C.  2321 et seq. I believe that the words \"manufacture\" or \"composition of matter\" do not cover these plants. That is because Congress intended the two more specific statutes to exclude patent protection under the Utility Patent Statute for the plants to which the more specific Acts directly refer. And, as the Court implicitly recognizes, this Court neither considered, nor decided, this question in Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303 (1980). Consequently, I dissent.~    ~    ~      65~      * Respondent and the Government claim that Chakrabarty controls the outcome in this case. This is incorrect, for Chakrabarty said nothing about the specific issue before us. Chakrabarty, in considering the scope of the Utility Patent Statute's language \"manufacture, or composition of matter,\" 35 U.S.C.  101 (1994 ed.), asked whether those words included such living things as bacteria a substance to which neither of the two specific plant Acts refers. 447 U.S., at 313-314. The Court held that the Utility Patent Statute language included a \"new\" bacterium because it was \"a nonnaturally occurring manufacture or composition of matter\" that was \"not nature's handiwork.\" Id., at 309-310. It quoted language from a congressional Committee Report indicating that \"Congress intended statutory subject matter to 'include anything under the sun that is made by man.' \" Id., at 309 (quoting S. Rep. No. 1979, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., 5 (1952); H. R. Rep. No. 1923, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., 6 (1952)). But it nowhere said or implied that this Utility Patent Statute language also includes the very subject-matter with which the two specific statutes deal, namely plants. Whether a bacterium technically speaking is, or is not, a plant, the Court considered it a \"life form,\" and not the kind of \"plant\" that the two specific statutes had in mind. 447 U.S., at 314 (noting that the PVPA specifically excluded bacteria, and that the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals had held that bacteria were not plants for purposes of the PPA).~    ~    ~      66~      The Court did consider a complicated argument that sought indirectly to relate the two specific plant statutes to the issue before it. That argument went roughly as follows: (1) Congress enacted two special statutes related to plants. (2) Even though those two statutes do not cover bacteria, the fact that Congress enacted them shows that Congress thought the Utility Patent Statute's language (\"manufacture, or composition of matter\") did not cover any living thing, including bacteria. (3) Congress consequently must have intended the two special Acts to provide exclusive protection for all forms of \"life\" whether they do, or do not, count as the kinds of \"plants\" to which the specific statutes refer.~    ~    ~      67~      The Court, in reply, wrote that Congress, when enacting the specific statutes, might have (wrongly) believed that the Utility Patent Statute did not apply to plants, probably because Congress thought that plants were \"natural products,\" not human products. Id., at 311. It added that Congress also might have believed that it was too difficult for plant inventors to meet patent law's ordinary \"written description\" requirement. Id., at 312. In addition, the Court pointed out that the relevant distinction between unpatentable and patentable subject matter was not between living and inanimate things, but rather between products of nature and human-made inventions. Id., at 312-313. As such, the bacteria at issue were patentable because they were products of human invention. And the Court concluded that \"nothing\" in Congress' decision to exclude bacteria from the PVPA supported \"petitioner's position,\" namely that Congress intended no utility patent protection for any living thing. Id., at 313-314.~    ~    ~      68~      Neither this refutation nor the argument itself decides the question here. That question is not about general coverage for matters that the special statutes do not mention (namely, nonplant life forms such as bacteria). It is about general coverage for matters to which the special plant statutes do refer (namely, plants). Chakrabarty neither asked, nor answered, this latter question, the question now before us. And nothing in the Court's opinion indicates the contrary.~    ~    II~    ~      69~      The critical question, as I have said, is whether the two specific plant statutes embody a legislative intent to deny coverage under the Utility Patent Statute to those plants to which the specific plant statutes refer. In my view, the first of these statutes, the PPA, reveals precisely that intent. And nothing in the later history of either the Utility Patent Statute or the PVPA suggests the contrary.~    ~    ~      70~      As initially enacted in 1930, the PPA began by amending the Utility Patent Statute to read as follows:~    ~    ~      71~      \"Any person who has invented or discovered any new and useful art, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvements thereof, or who has invented or discovered and asexually reproduced any distinct and new variety of plant, other than a tuber-propagated plant   may   obtain a patent therefor[e].\" Rev. Stat. 4886, as amended by Act of May 23, 1930, 1, 46 Stat. 376. (language added by the PPA italicized).~    ~    ~      72~      This language refers to all plants. It says that an inventor in principle can obtain a patent on any plant (the subject matter of the patent) that meets three requirements. It must be distinct; it must be new; and on one or more occasions it must have been \"asexually reproduced,\" e.g., reproduced by means of a graft.~    ~    ~      73~      This last-mentioned \"graft\" requirement does not separate (1) those plants that can reproduce through grafting from (2) those plants that can reproduce by seed. The two categories are not mutually exclusive. P. Raven, R. Evert,  S. Eichhorn, Biology of Plants 179-180, 255 (6th ed. 1999). Many plants perhaps virtually any plant can be reproduced \"asexually\" as well as by seed. S. Rep. No. 315, 71st Cong., 2d Sess., 5 (1930). Rather, the \"asexual reproduction\" requirement sought to ensure that the inventor was capable of reproducing the new variety \"asexually\" (through a graft) because that fact would guarantee that the variety's new characteristics had genetic (rather that, say, environmental) causes and would prove genetically stable over time. See ibid. (\"A plant patent covers only the exclusive right of asexual reproduction, and obviously it would be futile to grant a patent for a new and distinct variety unless the variety had been demonstrated to be susceptible to asexual reproduction\"); cf. Dunn v. Ragin, 50 USPQ 472, 474 (1941) (noting that asexual reproduction \"determine[s] that the progeny in fact possess the characteristic or characteristics which distinguish it as a new variety\").~    ~    ~      74~      Although the section defining the PPA's coverage does not limit its scope to plants that reproduce primarily through grafting, a later section does so limit the protection that it offers. That section specifies that the patent holder will receive \"the exclusive right to asexually reproduce the plant,\" e.g., the right to reproduce it through grafting, but he will not receive an exclusive right to reproduce the plant sexually, i.e., the right to reproduce it through seeds. 46 Stat. 376. And this is true regardless of whether the patent holder could reproduce true to type offspring through seeds. See S. Rep. No. 315, at 4 (\"On the other hand, [the PPA] does not give any patent protection to the right of propagation of the new variety by seed, irrespective of the degree to which the seedlings come true to type\"). This was a significant limitation because, the Court's contrary claim notwithstanding, ante, at 10, and n. 7, it was readily apparent in 1930 that a plant's desirable characteristics could be preserved through reproduction by seed. See Fowler, The Plant Patent Act of 1930: A Sociological History of its Creation, 82 J. Pat.  Tm. Off. Soc. 621, 635, 644 (2000).~    ~    ~      75~      In sum, the PPA permits patenting of new and distinct varieties of (1) plants that breeders primarily reproduce through grafts (say, apple trees), (2) plants that breeders primarily reproduce through seeds (say, corn), and (3) plants that reproduce both ways (say, violets). See C. Chong, Plant Propagation, reprinted in 1 CRC Handbook of Plant Science in Agriculture 91-92, 94, 104 (B. Christie  A. Hanson eds., 1987); Raven, Evert,  Eichhorn, supra, at 179. But, because that statute left plant buyers free to keep, to reproduce, and to sell seeds, the statute likely proved helpful only to those in the first category. Both the PPA's legislative history and the earliest patents granted under the Act fully support this interpretation. See S. Rep. No. 315, at 3 (explaining that varieties that \"resul[t] from seedlings of cross pollenization of two species\" were patentable under the Act); Plant Patent Nos. 1-2, 5-6, 8-11 (roses); Plant Patent Nos. 7, 15 (peach trees).~    ~    ~      76~      Given these characteristics, the PPA is incompatible with the claim that the Utility Patent Statute's language (\"manufacture, or composition of matter\") also covers plants. To see why that is so, simply imagine a plant breeder who, in 1931, sought to patent a new, distinct variety of plant that he invented but which he has never been able to reproduce through grafting, i.e., asexually. Because he could not reproduce it through grafting, he could not patent it under the more specific terms of the PPA. Could he nonetheless patent it under the more general Utility Patent Statute language \"manufacture, or composition of matter?\"~    ~    ~      77~      Assume the court that tried to answer that question was prescient, i.e., that it knew that this Court, in Chakrabarty, 447 U.S., at 311-312, would say that the Utility Patent Statute language (\"manufacture,\" or \"composition of matter\") in principle might cover \"anything under the sun,\" including bacteria. Such a prescient court would have said that the Utility Patent Statute did cover plants had the case reached it in 1929, before Congress enacted the more specific 1930 law. But how could any court decide the case similarly in 1931 after enactment of the 1930 amendment? To do so would virtually nullify the PPA's primary condition that the breeder have reproduced the new characteristic through a graft reading it out of the Act. Moreover, since the Utility Patent Statute would cover, and thereby forbid, reproduction by seed, such a holding would also have read out of the statute the PPA's more limited list of exclusive rights. Consequently, even a prescient court would have had to say, as of 1931, that the 1930 Plant Patent Act had, in amending the Utility Patent Statute, placed the subject matter of the PPA namely plants outside the scope of the words \"manufacture, or composition of matter.\" See United States v. Estate of Romani, 523 U.S. 517, 530-533 (1998) (holding that a later, specific statute trumps an earlier, more general statute).~    ~    ~      78~      Nothing that occurred after 1930 changes this conclusion. In 1952, the Utility Patent Statute was recodified, and the PPA language I have quoted was given its own separate place in the Code. See 35 U.S.C.  161 et seq. (1994 ed. and Supp. V). As Pioneer itself concedes, that change was not \"substantive.\" Brief for Respondent 7, see also ante, at 7. Indeed, as recodified the PPA still allows a breeder to obtain a patent when he \"invents or discovers and asexually reproduces any distinct and new variety of plant,\" 35 U.S.C.  161 (1994 ed.) (emphasis added), but it only allows the patent holder to \"exclude others from asexually reproducing the plant or selling or using the plant so reproduced,\" 163 (emphasis added).~    ~    ~      79~      Nor does the enactment of the Plant Variety Protection Act of 1970, change the conclusion. The PVPA proved necessary because plant breeders became capable of creating new and distinct varieties of certain crops, corn for example, that were valuable only when reproduced through seeds a form of reproduction that the earlier Act freely permitted. See S. Rep. No. 91-1246, pp. 2-3 (1970). Just prior to its enactment a special Presidential Commission, noting the special problems that plant protection raised and favoring the development of a totally new plant protection scheme, had recommended that \"[a]ll provisions in the patent statute for plant patents be deleted   .\" President's Commission on the Patent System, To Promote the Progress of Useful Arts, S. Doc. No. 5, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 20-21 (1967) (hereinafter S. Doc.). Instead Congress kept the PPA while adding the PVPA. The PVPA gave patent-like protection (for 20 years) to plants reproduced by seed, and it excluded the PPA's requirement that a breeder have \"asexually reproduced\" the plant. 7 U.S.C.  2402 2483. It imposed certain specific requirements. 2402 (variety must be new, distinct, uniform, and stable). And it provided the breeder with an exclusive right to sell, offer to sell, reproduce, import, or export the variety, including the seeds. 2483.~    ~    ~      80~      At the same time, the PVPA created two important exceptions. The first provided that a farmer who plants his fields with a protected plant \"shall not infringe any right hereunder\" by saving the seeds and planting them in future years. 2543. The second permitted \"use and reproduction of a protected variety for plant breeding or other bona fide research.\" 2544.~    ~    ~      81~      Nothing in the history, language, or purpose of the 1970 statute suggests an intent to reintroduce into the scope of the general words \"manufacture, or composition of matter\" the subject matter that the PPA had removed, namely plants. To the contrary, any such reintroduction would make meaningless the two exceptions for planting and for research that Congress wrote into that Act. It is not surprising that no party argues that passage of the PVPA somehow enlarged the scope of the Utility Patent Statute.~    ~    III~    ~      82~      The Court replies as follows to the claim that its reading of the Utility Patent Statute nullifies the PPA's limitation of protection to plants produced by graft and the PVPA's exemptions for seeds and research: (1) The Utility Patent Statute applies only to plants that are useful, novel, nonobvious, and for which the inventor provides an enabling written description of the invention. 35 U.S.C.  101 102, 103, 112 (1994 ed. and Supp. V). (2) The PVPA applies to plants that are novel, distinct, uniform, and stable. 7 U.S.C.  2402. (3) The second set of criteria seem slightly easier to meet, as they do not include nonobviousness and a written description (Pioneer does not argue that the \"useful\" requirement is significant). (4) And Congress could reasonably have intended the planting and research exceptions to apply only to the set of plants that can meet the easier, but not the tougher, criteria.~    ~    ~      83~      I do not find this argument convincing. For one thing, it is not clear that the general patent law requirements are significantly tougher. Counsel for Pioneer stated at oral argument that there are many more PVP certificates than there are plant patents. But he added that the major difference in criteria is the difference between the utility patent law's \"nonobviousness\" requirement and the specific Acts' requirement of \"newness\" a difference that may reflect the Patent Office's more \"rigorous\" examination process. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26, 30. But see S. Doc., at 20-21 (suggesting little difference because patent office tends to find \"nonobviousness\" as long as the plant is deemed \"new\" by the Department of Agriculture).~    ~    ~      84~      In any case, there is no relationship between the criteria differences and the exemptions. Why would anyone want to limit the exemptions related to seedplanting and research only to those new plant varieties that are slightly less original? Indeed, the research exemption would seem more useful in respect to more original, not less original, innovation. The Court has advanced no sound reason why Congress would want to destroy the exemptions in the PVPA that Congress created. And the Court's reading would destroy those exemptions.~    ~    ~      85~      The Court and Justice Scalia's concurrence also rely upon the interpretive canon that disfavors repeal by implication. The Court, citing Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Epstein, 516 U.S. 367 (1996), says that \"there is simply no evidence\" that the PPA was meant to preclude 101 protection for sexually reproduced plants. Ante, at 11-12. But reliance on the canon of \"implied repeal\" is misplaced. The canon has traditionally been embraced when a party claims that a later statute that does not actually modify an earlier statute implicitly repeals the earlier legislation. E.g., 516 U.S., at 380-381. That canon has no relevance to the PPA which explicitly amended the Utility Patent Statute by limiting protection to plants produced by graft. Even were that not so, the Court has noted that a later, more specific statute will ordinarily trump the earlier, more general one. See United States v. Estate of Romani, 523 U.S., at 530-533.~    ~    ~      86~      Regardless, canons are not mandatory rules. They are guides to help courts determine likely legislative intent. See Chickasaw Nation v. United States, 534 U.S. ___ (2001); see also Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U.S. 105, 115 (2001); id., at 137-140 (Souter, J., dissenting). And that intent is critical. Those who write statutes seek to solve human problems. Fidelity to their aims requires us to approach an interpretive problem not as if it were a purely logical game, like a Rubik's Cube, but as an effort to divine human intent that underlies the statute. Here that effort calls not for an appeal to canons, but for an analysis of language, structure, history, and purpose. Those factors make clear that the Utility Patent Statute does not apply to plants. Nothing in Chakrabarty holds to the contrary.~    ~    For these reasons, I dissent~    ",
