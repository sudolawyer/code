This problem set will introduce you to the concept of APIs by teaching  you how to use two different APIs: the FCC’s Electronic Comment Filing System, and Reuters’ Open Calais. API, which is short for Application Programming Interface, can have several different meanings. But for this lesson, its meaning is fairly specific: a set of procedures that enable one computer to read and/or write information of another computer. 

# Ex Parte Analyzer

The goal of this exercise is to use APIs to keep track of who met with FCC officials in a given notice and comment proceeding.

This lesson will cover the following areas:

- Using APIs
- JSON parsing

You may use the code in this document as a building block towards completing the lesson. However, the code samples only show how to achieve basic functionality of these APIs. It will be up to you to "glue" them together.

## Background

Administrative agencies often permit _ex parte_ meetings, so long as the meetings are disclosed and made part of the public record of the proceeding. _Ex parte_ meeting disclosures include the date of the meeting, the names of attendees, and a summary of relevant discussion that took place during the meeting.

Your employer, a small public advocacy organization, is interested in knowing who advocated various positions before the [Federal Communications Commission (FCC)](https://www.fcc.gov/) on an old issue which may come up again soon. Your employer wants to be ready as soon as the issue may be back on the FCC's agenda, and understanding who has already appeared before the FCC will help in the development of an effective advocacy strategy.

The issue is the cost of payphones inside of prisons. The FCC had a proceeding on this starting in 2012. All of the _ex parte_ filings in that proceeding are posted publicly and can be found in the FCC's Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS): https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/filings?q=(proceedings.name:((12-375*))%20OR%20proceedings.description:((12-375*)))&sort=date_disseminated,DESC&submissiontype_description=NOTICE%20OF%20EXPARTE.

As of this writing, there are over 500 _ex parte_ filings in FCC docker 12-375. It will simply take too much time to sort through all 500 or so filings by hand. But your employer has you, a scrappy coder-lawyer. What you'll create in this exercise will help your employer better understand the prison payphones proceeding, and perhaps even more importantly, provide a re-usable tool which can be used on any FCC proceeding.

### APIs 101

An application programming interface, or API, allows someone to write software that interacts with other software or systems. A specific type of API, known as a REST API, allows the interaction between systems to happen over the Internet. That’s the type of API we’ll be discussing in this problem set, and we’ll be using REST API and API interchangeably. 

By “visiting” the URL of an API, you can get machine-readable information that software can easily manipulate and interact with. In contrast to web scraping, APIs don't require complex HTML parsing. Instead information is typically available in a format called JSON (Javascript Object Notation). You need not worry too much about these details, but this explanation should provide helpful context throughout your journey of API discovery.

### FCC ECFS API

Thankfully, the FCC's Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS) has an API. The full documentation for the API can be found [here](https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/public-api-docs.html), but this lesson will explain in detail (and in short steps) everything you'll need to know for this exercise.

To get started, you'll need an API key. API keys are sort of like a username and password for an API. They allow the API provider to know who is using their API and can sometimes be used to block access to certain content. For the FCC ECFS API, you'll need to get a free API key from [api.data.gov](https://api.data.gov).

Once you have your key, you can practice using the ECFS API. Be sure to install `requests` (run in your terminal `pip install requests`). In an IDLE session:

```python
>>> import requests
>>> apiKey = '[redacted]'
>>> url = "https://publicapi.fcc.gov/ecfs/filings?q=12-375&api_key=" + apiKey
>>> response = requests.get(url)
```

In the above code, we import the `requests` module, construct a URL containing the API key and the docket number of the proceeding we're interested in (12-375). There are several components of this URL that are worth diving into:

The “base” URL or “domain”: https://publicapi.fcc.gov/.

Now, let's inspect the `response`:

```python
>>> json = response.json()
<class 'dict'>
>>> json.keys()
dict_keys(['filings', 'aggregations'])
>>> filings = json['filings']
>>> len(filings)
25
```

In the above code, we use the method `__class__` to figure out what type of object we have. Based on documentation for the `requests`, we know that the `json()` method is available for `requests.models.Response` objects. Luckily, `response.json()` returns a `dict`, which was covered in a previous lesson. Because we know how to use `dict`s, it's not difficult to figure out what they contain. We use the `keys()` method to get a list of keys, and the `[]` method to get the value for a given key. We've stored just the filings information in the variable `filings`. Let's explore what's in a filing:

```python
>>> firstFiling = filings[0]
>>> firstFiling.keys()
dict_keys(['date_disseminated', 'submissiontype', 'id_edocs', 'viewingstatus', 'report_number', 'proceedings', 'is_staff_upload', 'filingstatus', 'highlight', 'date_submission', 'legacy', 'filers', 'express_comment', 'remote_addr', 'bureaus', 'id_submission', 'id_bureau', 'exparte_or_late_filed', 'browser', 'path_info', 'internationaladdressentity', 'lawfirms', 'text_data', 'contact_email', 'authors', 'remote_host', 'date_received', '_index', 'file_number', 'confirmation_number', 'delegated_authority_number', 'addressentity', 'date_last_modified'])
>>> firstFiling['text_data']
'DOCKET FILE COPY ORIGINAL -EX PARTE OR LATE FILED ----------------------------------From: Sent: To: Subject: Dear Chairman Wheeler, Rob Street <martincountysheriff@gmail.com> Monday, December 09, 2013 3:51 PM Tom Wheeler Docket number 12-375 ACCEPTED/FILED MAR 252014 Federal Communications CommisSion Office of the Secretary In reference to ICS (WC docket number 12-375), I respectfully request the order be stayed as it pertains to Sheriffs and County Jails as it would place an extreme hardship on counties such as ours. Thank you, Sheriff Rob Street Martin County, Indiana 1 '
>>> firstFiling['submissiontype']
{'id_submission_type': 45, 'description': 'NOTICE OF EXPARTE', 'short': 'NOTICE', 'type': 'NO'}
```

Spend some time getting the values for the other keys. However, for this lesson, we're mostly concerned with just `text_data`.

### Open Calais API

Once you're fairly comfortable issuing a request to the FCC ECFS API, it's time to move on to another API: Open Calais. Open Calais is a service from Thomson Reuters, that among other things, provides "named entity extraction". Named entity extraction is the process of extracting things like names of people, companies, and places out of unstructured (e.g. free form) text. Open Calais is particularly adept at identifying names of people, which is just what we need for this exercise. Before proceeding, you'll need to [register](http://www.opencalais.com/opencalais-api/) (for free) with Open Calais and obtain an API key.

#### Example Open Calais API Request

Start a new IDLE session:

```python
>>> import requests
>>> apiKey = '[redacted]'
>>> calaisUrl = "https://api.thomsonreuters.com/permid/calais"
```

The above code imports `requests` and sets up a couple variables that we need. Next, we're going to form a dictionary of `headers`:

```python
>>> headers = {
...     'X-AG-Access-Token' : apiKey,
...     'Content-Type' : 'text/raw',
...     'outputFormat' : 'application/json',
...     'omitOutputtingOriginalText' : 'true'
... }
```

Headers are a part of an HTTP request which tell the server receiving the request certain information. This lesson is not focused on HTTP headers (they are a topic one could study for a long time). Rather, let's just know a few things about these headers:

- we're setting the `apiKey`
- we're specifying that data being sent to the server is raw text (`text/raw`)
- we're asking that the server send back JSON (`application/json`)
- we're asking that the server omit the original text in the response

Next, we're going to set up some example text. In this case, it's a snippet of text from an actual _ex parte_ filing (https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/filing/107311109308426/document/107311109308426418d):

```python
>>> rawText = """
... On July 28, 2016, Securus Technologies, Inc. ("Securus"),
... represented by Vice President and General Counsel Dennis J. Reinhold,
... Andrew J. Lipman, and the undersigned counsel, met with Travis Litman,
... Wireline Legal Advisor to Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel,
... to discuss the Fact Sheet released in the above-named docket on July 24, 2016.
... """
```

Next, we'll put all the pieces together and issue a `POST` request to the Open Calais server:

```python
>>> response = requests.post(calaisUrl, headers=headers, data=rawText)
>>> jsonResponse = response.json()
```

You may recall that previously, you used `requests.get()`. Why use `request.post()` this time? The short answer is that the Open Calais API specifies that this type of request is a `POST` request. If you're interested in the longer answer, this [Stack Overflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/3477374/94154) provides a good explanation for beginners.

Next, we're going to transform the response data into a `list` of names. But before we do so, it's worth printing the response JSON just to get a rough idea of what the Open Calais server is sending back:

```python
>>> print(jsonResponse())
```

If you're finding that difficult to read, a module called `pprint` can help:

```python
>>> import pprint
>>> pp = pprint.PrettyPrinter(indent=4)
>>> pp.pprint(jsonResponse)
```

Take a couple minutes and look at the different keys and values. Look for data that represents the names mentioned in the `rawText`. If you're stuck, use the following code:

```python
>>> people = []
>>> for key, value in jsonResponse.items():
...     if value.get('_type') == 'Person':
...         people.append(value.get('name'))
```

In the code above, we're creating an empty list, `people`, and then looping through the `jsonResponse` data to populate the list. In other words, we only care about data about people (and not company names, for example), so will filter for entities where their `'_type'` is `'Person'`.

```python
>>> print(people)
['Dennis J. Reinhold', 'Jessica Rosenworcel', 'Travis Litman', 'Andrew J. Lipman']
```







## Tasks

### exparteAnalysis.py

#### getFilings

In a file called `exparteAnalysis.py`, create a function called `getFilings` which takes the following arguments:

- docket
- limit
- apiKey

The function should use the `requests` library to make a GET request to the FCC ECFS API to retrieve filings for the given docket. To make a GET request using the requests library, use the `get()` method:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get(someUrl)
```

The base url for this request is `https://publicapi.fcc.gov/ecfs/filings`.

To add options to the GET request, in other words to add a “query string”, you use `requests`’ named argument, `params`:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get(someUrl, params=aDictionaryOfOptions)
```

The function should return a `requests.models.Response` object. When you call `.json()` on this value, you should get a Python dictionary that contains a list of filings (just like in the example code in the beginning of this problem set). 

You’ll know that the response object is a `requests.models.Response` by calling the `__class__` function on it and printing the result. (This is just the beginning of a much larger topic called Object Oriented Programming, which is not the subject of this problem set.) However, this will provide a useful way of know if your function is returning the correct type of data.

For example:

```python
response = getFilings(‘12-375’, 100, ‘myApiKey1234567abcde’)

print(response.__class__)
# should print: <class 'requests.models.Response'>

# getting a list of filings 
filings = response.json()[‘filings’]

# looping through the list and printing the first 500 characters
for filing in filings:
    print(filing[‘text_data’][0:500])
```

You can also access the raw, unparsed text of the response body by calling `.text` (notice the lack of parentheses) on it. For example:

```
response.text
```

[Note on HTTP response codes]
[Possible note on using RegEx to detect 4xx codes]

#### saveFilings

Create a function called `saveFilings` which takes the following arguments:

- filingsResponse (the `requests.models.Response` object returned from `getFilings`)
- path (a directory to save the filings)
- filename (the name of the file to be created)

When called, the function should save the text of the response object in the directory defined by `path` and named by the `filename` variable.

For example:

```python
import requests

filingsResponse = getFilings(‘12-375’, 100, ‘myApiKey1234567abcde’)
saveFilings(filingsResponse, ‘filings’, ‘12-375.json’)
```

Should create a file called `12-375.json` inside the `filings` directory. The contents of this file should be the results of `response.text`.

[Include sample code?]

#### readFilings

Create a function called `readFilings` which takes the following arguments:

- path
- filename

`readFilings(‘filings’, ‘12-375.json’)` should return a list of the parsed JSON contents of `filings/12-375.json`. 

When you run:

```python
contents = open(‘filings/12-375.json’).read()
```

`contents` is a string. But because it is a JSON string, you can parse it into a Python dictionary using Python’s built-in JSON library:

```python
import json

parsedJson = json.loads(“{‘hello’: ‘world’}”)
print(parsedJson[‘hello’])
# ‘world’
```

### apiKeys.py

You just received your API key from the FCC.  Your API key identifies you to the FCC, and allows API service providers to identify who is making requests, how frequent those requests are, and the ability to limit or discontinue access for abusers of API services.  Without a valid API key, you cannot access an API that requires an API key.

Rather than store your API key in your main file, you are going to write a module in a separate file called key.py, which you will `import` into your app.py script in order to access your API key.

Note, your apiKeys.py file could conceivably store multiple API keys.  For example, if you had access to APIs by Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and the FCC, you could store all of your keys in one place, and then call them as you wish in your main script file.

Here, store your API key in a variable called `fcc`.  Recall from previous problem sets how we imported another function or module, like this:

```python
import apiKeys
```

Then, to test whether you have successfully built the module and correctly stored your API key, do this in your app.py file:

```python
print(apiKeys.fcc)
```

Your script should print the API key that you have stored in your fcc variable.  We’ll use this in our app.py file throughout the problem set, so ensure you have correctly completed this step, and that your API key is identical to the one you received by email.
